Okay then, I’ll start my explanation.”</p><p><strong>Yae:</strong> “Yogiri-senpai~ Shouldn’t you start with introducing yourself?”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Right. Bet there are some who are curious as to why you’re wearing a costume, too.</p><p>…Anyway, this is relatively unimportant, but call me ‘Captain’ instead of ‘Yogiri-senpai’, ‘kay?</p><p>I don’t really give a shit, but everyone else won’t shut up about it…</p><p>I said I’ll pass because it’s too much trouble, but they end up making me the Softball Club captain <em>and</em> Athletics Committee chairman, y’know?</p><p>If that’s how it’s gonna play anyway, I wish I’d become a student council member instead.</p><p>I mean, I’m gonna be busy either way… so I want some comfort or like, <em>love</em>, you know?</p><p>If I were part of the stuco, I can be with Hiyono anytime.</p><p>Hiyono, Hiyono, I wanna see you. Hiyono~ Why have we been placed in different classes~…?”</p><p><strong>Yae:</strong> “Urgh, you’re <em>unbearable</em>… Please take things more seriously. Look at me, I’m helping you despite the troubles, aren’t I?</p><p>Come on! Stop writing ‘Hiyono’ all over the blackboard!</p><p>Can you spare us your strange act? You’re grossing out the new kids…</p><p>Geez, you’ve completely regressed into a useless human being since becoming a third year, huh?”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “(<em>sniff</em>) Oh, shut up. You’re cheeky for a tiny mascot.</p><p>You’re so cute, damnit. You’ve become a second year, but you haven’t seemed to grow even an inch taller, huh?”</p><p><strong>Yae:</strong> “I’ll be entering my growth period from now!</p><p>…Well, my parents and older brother are practically dwarves so I guess I shouldn’t be too hopeful.</p><p>But I’ll drink lots of milk and become big! Gulp, gulp~”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Still moving to your own tune like ever, huh Nagamachi?</p><p>Well, we just welcomed a new school year… I guess human beings can’t change so suddenly.</p><p>Whatever. Softball Club aside, as part of the Athletics Committee I should be encountering the studco often.</p><p>So I’ll finish up my job as smoothly as always this time.</p><p>And so—let’s begin the self-introductions!</p><p>I’m the Athletics Committee Chairman, Yogiri Hayate. I’m the Hero of Justice that protects the peace of Kimisaki Academy~”</p><p><strong>Yae:</strong> “Just ignore the last bit~ And I act as the chairman’s assistant; the name’s Nagamachi Yae!”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Well, I don’t think it’ll be for very long, but let’s get along.</p><p>Kids, while you’re listening, take a look at the print we just gave you.</p><p>We’re planning for an event called the Freshman Gathering that’ll be held in two weeks.</p><p>To cut to the chase, it’s basically a culture festival just for first-years.</p><p>And for that Gathering…</p><p>The tradition is to choose a few committee chairmen to be placed in each first year class, to support the first years who haven’t gotten used to the Academy yet.</p><p>Until last year, we have two or three committee chairmen assigned to each one class…</p><p>But since Kimisaki Academy becomes coed this year… Seems we’ve gotten quite a large number of freshmen.</p><p>And the number of classes increases, too.</p><p>Frankly speaking, just the number of you first years alone is already double the other grades, y’know?</p><p>And so, because of the lack of hands, there’s just one committee chairman assigned to each class.</p><p>But we’re also given an assistant, and in my case, I have Nagamachi, see?</p><p>I wanted to have Hiyono, though~ But Nagamachi said to leave it to her and forced herself on me~”</p><p><strong>Yae:</strong> “Shut up… That Hiyono person, she’s from a different class and a different club and a different committee from you, right?</p><p>Then she’s a complete stranger. And it seems she’s busy, being a student council officer, right?</p><p>Just be satisfied with having me, Yogiri-senpai~”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Like I said, call me Captain… I guess that doesn’t matter.</p><p>Anyway, basically we’re in charge of this class. Remember our faces, alright~?</p><p>Well, there’s another one—Ichigou<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>… I mean Kodama Ichika — who’s supposed to be helping us out. We’ll introduce her later.</p><p>(<em>whisper</em>) Oi, Nagamachi. Where’s Ichigou? Is she skipping, that little shit?”</p><p><strong>Yae:</strong> “Umm~ Ichika, after her sister graduated… she seems to be trying to look away from the loneliness by practicing her sword skills to death.</p><p>Just leave her to herself for now, Yogiri-senpai.</p><p>I’ll be supporting you with all I have in exchange!”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Really, that’s kinda worrying. She can be so cynical sometimes.</p><p>Well, that aside. It already says so in the paper, but the Freshman Gathering is in two weeks. What you’ll be making has been decided in the committee meeting.</p><p>I think you first years won’t be having much burden, so just take it easy, yeah?</p><p>By the way, in Kimisaki Academy’s Gathering… there’s a tradition of having some animal ears as motif.</p><p>To go straight to the point… the theme this year is bunny ears!</p><p>The year above me—the third years that have graduated, they had bunny ears as motif too.</p><p>And you, the new first years, will be continuing on them.</p><p>But we’re coed this year, and some of you are male, so honestly, I’m not sure what to think, yeah?</p><p>But, well, Nagamachi and I… when we were first years, we were made to wear cat ears and dog ears.</p><p>So to be frank, it’d totally <em>tick me off</em> if you guys alone were to be spared from the embarrassing tradition.</p><p>That’s how traditions are passed, first years!</p><p>But anyway, for you guys, it’ll be your first school event.</p><p>Make lots of friends while you’re at it. Make lots of pleasant memories.</p><p>Get along and liven the racket, the Kimisaki way… Just have as much fun as you want, yeah?”</p><h2 id="new-era">New Era</h2><h3 id="part-1"><strong>Part 1</strong></h3><p><strong>Location: Corridor</strong></p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “~</p><p>Hmm-hmm-hmm~”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “You seem to be in a good mood, Hiyono-chan.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hwee? No, umm, I-I’m sorry. Listening to me humming must’ve been gross, right?</p><p>U-Uugh… I have to stop being this self-abasing!”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Calm down. Isn’t it fine? It’s peaceful…</p><p>It’s hard not to feel giddy at the start of a new semester, but I think I’ve gotten used to life as a third year a bit.</p><p>And to student council work, too. Now that I look back on it, I realize anew how abnormal the previous year was.</p><p>It was so hectic every day, wasn’t it?</p><p>But it seems this year, most of our first years are quiet children…</p><p>Though of course, since until last year, we’ve been mostly an all-girls school, lots of things feel fresh… and rather strange.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Ehehe. Yes, there are boys normally passing by the corridors now.</p><p>I’m still not used to the sight, so whenever I pass by them, I tend to stiffen up a bit~”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “We’ll need to get used to it, though. That’s what Transfer student-kun was for in the first place, wasn’t it?</p><p>Well, that one <em>is</em> a little unique for a boy, I guess…”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Yes~ By the way, since the new first years are all wearing the new uniform design—even putting the boys aside, the girls are also a fresh sight.</p><p>But that makes it easier to tell them from the rest, I suppose.”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Yeah. We old students are still wearing the old uniform, after all.</p><p>Some fashionable students are happy with the new uniform and wear them, though.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “There’s also Mizushima-senpai who repeated a grade—she’s wearing the new uniform, right?</p><p>With the old uniform, we got different colors based on our year batch, after all.</p><p>I assume she feels awkward about wearing a green uniform alone when all her classmates wear blue.”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “In that sense, I guess this decision was timely. Though I think I see that person wear her white school swimsuit more than I see her in uniform.</p><p>We have boys now, so I hope she won’t walk around in her swimsuit too much…”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Fufu. The school rule was lax in the first place, but it’s practically free when it comes to uniform…</p><p>The disciplinary committee has quieted down a lot, too.”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Yeah. I’m starting to think Segawa-senpai was really necessary.</p><p>Because she often scolded Momo-chan for scribbling, I didn’t have such a good impression of her… But having too much freedom isn’t so good either, huh?”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Right~ But still, in the end, <em>this</em> is the Kimisaki uniform for us…</p><p>It’s packed full of memories.”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Ahaha. Last semester, we had a tough time regarding the new uniform…</p><p>So it’s kinda anticlimactic that we end up wearing our old uniforms, isn’t it?”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “But the new first years are all pleased with the new uniform, so I’d say it’s a happy ending.”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Agreed. And it’s Sumire-chan’s design that ended up getting picked, so that goes double.</p><p>Sometimes, I consider wearing the new uniform myself,</p><p>But we only have one year left of high school. Buying a new set of uniform feels like such a waste.</p><p>Then again, I’ve just grown even taller, so I guess I can buy a new set once I outgrow this one…”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hau… You’re still growing…? I’m envious, Natsumi-san.</p><p>You and Tomoko-san both have such nice bodies; I feel left out being the only tiny one, you know?”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “You have your own type of fans, Hiyono-chan. The first year boys seem to be appreciating your cuteness.</p><p>We’re drawing attention and cheering just by walking down the corridor like this, too.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hawawa… It’s like we’ve become idols. Student council officers are amazing…</p><p>I guess they’re the ‘well-known people’ of the school. I didn’t even dream of this until last year…”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “True. But well, we chose this for ourselves…</p><p>We can’t take it back or escape from it. Let’s support each other and march forward, until our graduation day.</p><p>All of us in the student council, together. I’m always on your side, Hiyono-chan.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Yes, Natsumi-san… It’s an honor!</p><p>I’ll be doing my best too.</p><p>First of all, I guess we have the Freshman Gathering coming up soon. Let’s enliven the event and make sure it goes down without a hitch!”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Well, the Gathering centers on the first years and the committees…</p><p>We’re just kinda like their managers. The workload is light on us.</p><p>But it’s our first big event since we’ve become coed; let’s not let our guard down.</p><p>By the way, student council does get included in ‘committees’ so…</p><p>Our leader, Transfer student-kun… well, President-kun, seems to be assigned to a first year class too.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Fufu. Honestly, President is always hard at work.</p><p>He was already really busy last year, but this year, he’ll be even busier, right?</p><p>I’m worried for him. I hope he won’t pass out from exhaustion.”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “No, no, it’s fine! No need to worry about him. He has fun doing that.</p><p>Just leave him to do what he wants.</p><p>Different from your Darling… my Darling is practically helping people for the simple act itself.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hawawa? W-W-Who did you mean by <em>my</em> Darling?</p><p>Umm, you see, I haven’t been able to meet Hayate-san since we’ve been placed in different classes…</p><p>Things have been a little distant and, well… kind of vague between us, you see?</p><p>Of course, she’s always shining passionately in my heart, though~…</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Rather than stick with an imaginary one in your heart, you can just impose on her class. She’s right there at a place where you can meet her whenever you miss her.</p><p>I think she’ll welcome you with wide arms if you do, you know?”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “No, but umm, I think I’ll still be a bother, so…?”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Hmm… Well, most of the student council work often ends up being done by Tomoko-chan.</p><p>So whether President-kun is present or not doesn’t make much difference.</p><p>I guess this is just how this year’s stuco will be: we have the right people at the right places.</p><p>President-kun is helping people left and right, so the student council’s popularity keeps on rising.</p><p>It’s good to have a husband that’s often absent from home~<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Yes. I don’t believe we’ll have anything like the Student Council President Reelection mess breaking out again.</p><p>As a member of the Newspaper Club, part of me is a little lonely at the thought, though.”</p><p>(You know, Prez… no, Fumi-san. I’m having so much fun every day.</p><p>Hmm-hmm-hmm~…)</p><h3 id="part-2">Part 2</h3><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “(<em>sigh</em>)…”</p><p>(Ngaah… I feel melancholic. Not that I know how to spell ‘melancholic’ with kanji. Umm, where did I put my electronic dictionary, again?</p><p>Ah, right. I haven’t been carrying it around lately.</p><p>I usually put it in my pocket for songwriting purposes, but I don’t have the need for it anymore.</p><p>Suzu-senpai and Seira-senpai graduated…</p><p>I was so lonely, so upset at the thought they wouldn’t be there even if I went to the Rock Band Club room… and I never did show up there anymore.</p><p>Because of that, things have been a little strained between me and Shizuku-chan…</p><p>We’re put in different classes again. I don’t see Shizuku-chan unless I show up for club.</p><p>And we’ve been busy since it’s just the start of the new semester.</p><p>Ah, no… those are just excuses I made up to run away from her.</p><p>She’s messaged me so many times, but…</p><p>I don’t know how to reply. It feels like I’ll end up saying something cruel to Shizuku-chan.</p><p>We last met during the seniors’ graduation; I cried and cried and sulked, not wanting to let them go…</p><p>Even though that was something beyond our power.</p><p>Shizuku-chan and I should be continuing on the important thing we’ve received from our seniors. We should be supporting each other…</p><p>But all I ever do is depend on her. All I ever do is whine.</p><p>Shizuku-chan… I’m sure she’s tired of me too.</p><p>Shizuku-chan was there for me.</p><p>She was considerate of my feelings; telling me many times that I’m her friend, that I’m her precious comrade in the Rock Band Club…</p><p>But I shut my ears from all that and ran away.</p><p>After all—I hate this, I hate this, <em>I hate this</em>! I wanna see Suzu-senpai! I wanna hear Seira-senpai’s song!</p><p>But they’ve both graduated!</p><p>I shouldn’t be averting my eyes away from that.</p><p>Suzu-senpai, she tried to forget the pain of losing something precious to her…</p><p>…by acting like a chuuni, like she’s broken—but I can’t be like her.</p><p>I’m a coward… But… I mean, I don’t have anything.</p><p>I have half-baked talents in playing instruments and singing. I have no guts to stand on stage… and even with writing songs or lyrics, I’m…</p><p>I heard some of the new kids who joined are experienced with doing music.</p><p>Suzu-senpai and Seira-senpai have formed a band together, and they seem to have gotten famous.</p><p>Lots of kids who admire them are pushing to enter the Rock Band Club. I get how they feel. That’s just natural.</p><p>After all, I was the same. I admired them too.</p><p>And it’s precisely because we’re the same, that compared to those new kids who can play instruments, sing, write songs and lyrics…</p><p>My uselessness will stand out even more.

It could be taken as sexual harassment, in case you’re not aware!</p><p>Y-You’re going to massage my shoulders?</p><p>No, umm, you don’t have to… I mean, my shoulders are completely bare, too…</p><p>Eh? This is to repay me for when I cleaned your ears that one time? You still remember such a small happening…?</p><p>Even for me, that day was…</p><p>A day full of remembrance, where I became just a little closer to you, and opened up my heart for the first time…</p><p>….~</p><p>Fufu. All right then. I’m in a better mood. Continue to serve me like that.</p><p>Meanwhile, can you explain to me about that thing you’ve been planning?</p><p>Like a virtuous wife, I shall take three steps back and support you… President~”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Yahoo~</p><p>‘Yoohoo!’ This one’s to make up for Mizu-chan’s part!</p><p>It’s just me today. Mizu-chan’s gone to a farther university, after all.</p><p>She lives in a dorm too, and since she’s just starting her campus life, she seems to be busy.</p><p>My campus is close by and I have nothing to do, so I invited my uni friends over to come play!</p><p>Are you doing well, my student council juniors! Welcome me with your all—Futaba Minazuki-chan has come over to play!”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “……</p><p>…Ah, sorry. Seriously, I’m so sorry. I always come at a bad time.</p><p>…This is awkward.</p><p>Not to mention, I’m feeling extremely silly for failing to recall how I used to act in high school and giving you guys an excessively plucky greeting.</p><p>Sorry for the interruption! Take your sweet time, young pair of lovebirds~”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “Wa-Wait a second, please! I will cut you down if you dare to move from that spot, Minazuki-senpai…!”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Whoa, scary. It’s scary to see after a while, that blade.</p><p>You haven’t changed huh, Tomoko-chan?”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “Haah… Yes, Minazuki-senpai, it has been a while.</p><p>You remind me, the alumni are also invited to the Freshman Gathering, aren’t they?”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Yeah. It so happens my uni friends has been bugging me about my alma mater… I’ve been kinda forced to show them around the academy.</p><p>I guess they took an interest when I recounted my experiences as a joke.</p><p>They’ve gotten themselves tired after walking all over, so they’re now resting at the food area – the gym.</p><p>As for me, I kinda miss this place ~ So I’ve been taking a walk around.</p><p>Seriously, it’s great to see it hasn’t changed, Kimisaki Academy~</p><p>So you know, while I was walking, I saw the Student Council Room… and recalled that <em>oh right, I was a member of the student council, wasn’t I?</em></p><p>I mean, yeah, <em>you’re not supposed to forget that, Minazuki!</em>―but moving on…</p><p>I thought if any of you were around, I should pop up for a greeting, so I took a peek… but then gosh, that lewd scene took me by surprise.”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “No, umm. That wasn’t it—please do not misunderstand.</p><p>President… Transfer student-san prostrated, imploring me to wear a bunny girl outfit no matter what.”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “You can keep calling him President. So you’ve really become the student council president, huh… Transfer student-kun?</p><p>But still, you granted his request just because he begged. You’ve become quite generous, Tomoko-chan.</p><p>Back in the day, you were just like an unsheathed Japanese sword.”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “Yes… This is embarrassing. I am reflecting on it. Just what has gotten into me…?”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Fufu, isn’t it fine? You can only wear that stuff when you’re young.”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “No, umm, even if you call me ‘young’…</p><p>You are as tiny as last I saw you, Senpai. You still look so much younger than me, so it sounded rather strange, you know?”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Nah, seems I’m just starting my growth spurt, you see… I’m just getting growing pains.</p><p>I made a doctor visit to make sure. Apparently, my height is gonna shoot up from now.</p><p>Next time we see each other, maybe you’ll be meeting a sexy, all-grownup version of Futaba Minazuki-chan instead~”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “Eeh? I can’t imagine that of you, senpai…</p><p>Well, rather than that; since you’re already all the way here, shall I show you around?</p><p>I was just thinking to start my patrol.”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Ooh, that’s a help. It hasn’t been that long since I graduated, but everything already feels so new and fresh…</p><p>I’ve forgotten lots of old things, and lots of new things have also taken place.</p><p>I can’t help feeling that I’m just a mere guest now; it’s kinda lonely.</p><p>I’m jealous of you kids. Of course, I’m having fun at my campus too, though!”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “Yes, please do tell us all about it.</p><p>We are taking entrance exams this year, so I am quite interested in what life at university is like.”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Yep, let me introduce you to my uni friends too!</p><p>Come with us too, Transfer student-kun. Staying behind is just gonna be lonely, right?</p><p>I’ll treat you to something! Come over here~”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “Ooh, you are being unusually forceful. You are really Minazuki-senpai, right? Not Mizuki-senpai…?”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Minazuki it is! I can’t be with Mizu-chan always and forever, you know.</p><p>So I need to learn how to be independent.</p><p>I’ll pull your hand, Tomoko-chan… Transfer student-kun~</p><p>You two must’ve been busy taking care of your underclassmen now that you’re third years…</p><p>Let your senpai spoil you sometimes!”</p><h2 id="the-person-inside"><strong>The Person Inside</strong></h2><h3 id="part-1-4"><strong>Part 1</strong></h3><p><strong>Location: Corridor</strong></p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hmm-hmm-hmm~”</p><p>(The Freshman Gathering is at its peak~!</p><p>The new students, the old, and the guests are all wearing such sparkling smiles on them♪</p><p>I think the memory card in my digital camera isn’t going to be enough… I should return to the Newspaper Club room to get a new one.</p><p>But the Freshman Gathering is going to end soon, isn’t it?</p><p>It’s already after school, and quite late too.</p><p>It’s about time for the guests to go back home; but the students still need to stay behind for the cleanup and stuff.</p><p>The prep and the cleanup after the events are both part of our youth, too. I’ll immortalize all of these moments in photos.</p><p>Since it’s looking to end without any hiccups, I think writing this into an interesting article will be a lot of work, but…</p><p>Peace really is best, isn’t it? Yup, yup♪</p><p>Plus, it seems President and many other people have some kind of hidden agenda…</p><p>The Gathering isn’t going to die down without a fight, is it?</p><p>Aah, so fun! I’m really living my fullest.</p><p>Fumi-san also came over to play today, and she praised me when I went to greet her, saying that I had a good smile on me~♪</p><p>Fumi-san has become a lot milder… She’s letting her hair down too. It made her look like an entirely different person~</p><p>But of course; she’s in university now. She was so mature and wonderful♪</p><p>Can I mature the way Fumi-san did…?</p><p>No, for now I should focus on enjoying the little time I have left as a child! Hip-hip-hurraay♪</p><p>Ehehe. I’m getting excited; it must be the festivities getting to me.</p><p>But I can’t focus on just the fun; I need to get working ♪</p><p>I have all the necessary materials to write the next school paper thanks to the hard work of our new members…</p><p>So maybe I should see our respected guests off instead, as a student council officer?</p><p>I shouldn’t be making these decisions on my own, so I should contact the president first… There.)</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Ooi, Hiyono-chan♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Wahya!? Oh, you are the former secretary… umm, Minazuki-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Yup, yup. I’m surprised you could tell it’s <em>me</em>, at a glance~</p><p>Well, it seems Mizu-chan has changed her hairstyle lately, so we’ve become easier to tell apart.</p><p>You look well, Hiyono-chan. Hard at work?”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Y-Yeeess! So that I won’t soil the honor of my predecessors, the two Futaba-senpais,</p><p>as well as making problems for the president, I’ve been giving it my very best!”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Ah, you don’t need to be so apprehensive…</p><p>People will think I did something. That part of you hasn’t changed, huh~?</p><p>But I didn’t have any underclassman in the Occult Club, so it’s a little refreshing♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hauu. Minazuki-senpai, might you have come to visit us for the Gathering?”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Ahaha, don’t be so formal with me~</p><p>We never spoke much when I was still a student here, so I’m not sure what lines I should draw with you either,</p><p>but I heard you’ve been doing the secretary job well, when we used to skip on it all the time.</p><p>Tomoko-chan had nothing but praises for you~ There, there, you good girl♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Ehehe. I’m happy! I may lack experience, but I’ll do my best to cover for it…♪”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Mhm, you’re such a good girl.</p><p>Speaking of – I’m just reminded about Tomoko-chan… Have you seen that girl somewhere?”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hwe? Seen Tomoko-san…?</p><p>No, umm, I’m afraid the student council members are all moving separately for the Gathering…</p><p>We don’t have enough people, so we need to be spread all over the school to get things done~</p><p>We should probably recruit new people though, such as for general affairs…</p><p>I think the previous council managed somehow because its president came to the rescue of a lot of people?”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Right~ What with Mizu-chan and I not doing our job at all, we really made Himari-chan go through a lot…</p><p>Pretty late to say that though, ahaha.</p><p>But if transfer student-kun is the student president now… I think you can attract some enthusiastic help.</p><p>There’s nothing good about pushing yourselves too hard; it’s definitely better to get more helping hands where you can.</p><p>Especially since you look so pale, Hiyono-chan. I’m worried now; are you eating properly?”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hwe? No, umm, I’ve always been a light eater… and since it’s been so busy these days, I haven’t been getting much sleep.</p><p>I mean, that’s not it! What about Tomoko-san – did something happen to her? Why are you looking for her?”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Right. We really veered off our initial topic.</p><p>This isn’t a good habit to keep… Mizu-chan always just prattled on, so all I ever had to do was retort to her jokes or follow on her…</p><p>I think I’m not too good at talking on my own.</p><p>Anyway, well… I was having a meal with Tomoko-chan and Transfer student-kun in the gym–the food area…</p><p>But it seemed Tomoko-chan completely forgot that she was wearing a bunny girl outfit.</p><p>When someone pointed it out to her, she got beet red, kicked a fuss, and ran off somewhere.</p><p>You don’t know what that girl might pull when she gets too stimulated.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be a problem if she was slashing off the head of everyone she came by in the heat of her escape?”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Ah, so that’s why you’re looking for her.</p><p>But why was she wearing a bunny girl outfit…? I mean, yes, the theme for the Gathering this year is bunny ears, but…?”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “No idea. Seems transfer student-kun forced her to change into it.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “The president? Hmm, lately, it does feel like he’s been working on something behind us…</p><p>Well, it’s okay. We’ll deal with it somehow. I know Tomoko-san’s number, so I’ll give her a call.</p><p>Tomoko-san is bad with tech in general though, so there’s no guarantee she’s carrying her phone around.</p><p>If it gets really bad, I can ask Maruko-san to use the school broadcast to call her over – we’ve been getting along well lately.”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Okay then, thank you.</p><p>Seems alright to leave it to you kids~ fufufu.</p><p>My friends from university live far, so I need to take them home; I’ll have to pardon myself.</p><p>Today has been a lot of fun. Thank you, I’m so glad I could see you… Hiyono-chan♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Yes, so am I. Please, do come over to play sometimes, Minazuki-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Sure. But well, the leading role of Kimisaki Academy is you children now.</p><p>So you shouldn’t drag out the past with us alumni too much.</p><p>There are probably kids who can’t let go that easily.</p><p>But I should stop here.

I think I’m communicating well with the new members of the Newspaper Club… probably.</p><p>I know I should learn to be more strict, like Fumi-san.</p><p>But I can’t seem to get rid of my habit of being all servile and meek, huh~?</p><p>I’m their boss. I have to act more important to suit my title.</p><p>I need to puff out my chest in confidence with a ‘huff♪’ like Fumi-san did.</p><p>Hnn~… It doesn’t suit me, huh? I’m always hunching over, after all. Whatever I do, I always end up looking up timidly at people.</p><p>This is just how I am… I have no choice but to work with what I have.</p><p>But… What did the new kids mean when they said I should come to the sports grounds?</p><p>They can’t be thinking of something untoward? Hmm?</p><p>Should I scold them off for acting on their own?</p><p>But no, maybe because they saw that I was busy with my student council duties… they were trying to be considerate by not reporting beforehand?</p><p>The grounds, huh… Sure, it’s been pretty noisy outside.</p><p>I thought… that it was because the guardians and other guests of the Gathering were going home?</p><p>It’s quite far so I can’t really tell, but are those food stalls outside?</p><p>I can hear music too… Nn~ I didn’t hear anything about such an event, though?</p><p>This isn’t good.

And it’ll be entertaining… but full of things that may or may not be true♪</p><p>Someone like that is necessary, I think. After all, if everyone around you is a yes-man, you may not notice when you take the wrong step.</p><p>I will write your actions into the papers – objectively, and fairly.</p><p>Of course, whatever they read, the student body still hold the final judgment. But please, take it to mind that there’s more than one way of seeing things out there.</p><p>You must be in a hurry.
