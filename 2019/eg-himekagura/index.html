And for the n-th time, Happy New Year.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Ooh, Shizu! I’ve been waiting for you! Happy New Year! And Rock ‘n Roll…!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Kuromori-senpai – I’ve been thinking of saying this for a while, but Rock ‘n Roll isn’t a greeting.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Eh? Then what’s Rock ‘n Roll!? I don’t know anymore—tell me, Shizu…!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “You’re as much of a pain in the neck as ever, so early into the year…. Anyway, not that I care, but what did you need from me, senpai? I was doing my first shrine visit with family; it’s annoying to have you call me out on a sudden notice.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Oh, you went to the shrine? Now that I look at you, you’re wearing an adorable <em>furisode</em> on you~”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “(sighs) Well, my parents like to waste money on my attires, for some reason… I jumped to your call without wasting time on changing because it sounded like an emergency, can I get a praise?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Of course! You’re such a good girl, Shizu! <em>Homehome</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Don’t say those words with that mouth of yours.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Eh!? I’m sorry, Shizu! I know it’s your catchphrase but I’ve wanted to say it just once! Cuz it’s cute!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Hmm… You’re being hyper today, Kuromori-senpai… Don’t tell me you haven’t slept? It’s easy to get hyper when running on no sleep.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Right. I was thinking to get some sleep when I get home, but then I got a call and had to do a U-turn in the middle of my way back… I took the train and came all the way here.</p><p>While having breakfast on a family restaurant around here, I did doze off and got some short shut-eyes, though.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “You should get a proper sleep. Kuromori-senpai, you look even more ill with those bags under your eyes from lack of rest… But anyway, so you were just called here, too?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Yeah. By someone I can’t ignore.</p><p>Still—Rock Band Club gathered yesterday, played until morning…</p><p>…and only just separated, right? Sorry that you guys got to go home only once it’s morning because of all the ruckus.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Yeah… I don’t know about you, Kuromori-senpai, but Ruka-chan and Prez both seem to have strict parents. I’m worried they’re getting scolded because of us.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Right… I called Ruka and Sera too, but they say they’re prioritizing their family today. Actually, I’m surprised you came, Shizu; was it okay?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Well… I’ve been acting sweet to my parents non-stop, and I’m tired. I was just looking for an excuse to leave; it’s a help you called me out here, actually.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “……Shizu. I didn’t know if it was alright to ask, so I never alluded to it; but are you getting along with your parents? It’s better to have good relations with your family, you know?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “It has nothing to do with you, Kuromori-senpai. And <em>you</em> never talk about <em>your</em> family too; are you not getting along, perhaps?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Mm… It’s not like I’m on bad terms with them. Just a little—well, it’ll be nice if you and I can both talk about this stuff like it’s all a joke someday.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “True. I really agree.</p><p>Well, leaving all that aside… Who called you here and what for, Kuromori-senpai? I can’t come up with a guess.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Right, don’t worry, I’ll explain. But we shouldn’t be standing around here. It’s cold out and all; seems there’s flu going around too.</p><p><em>…Achoo!</em>”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Ahaha. Look who’s sneezing right after saying that.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Ugh, well whatever… Our destination is Otouto-kun<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>’s house. Have you gone there, Shizu?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “By Otouto-kun, you mean the transfer student senpai, right?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Yep. Might as well say your ‘<em>Papa</em>’… <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> You’ve somehow gotten the habit of calling that boy <em>Papa</em>, huh, Shizu? Exactly why? It’s been bothering me.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Look at yourself, who’s taken to calling him <em>Otouto-kun</em> out of nowhere. Well, I do know the reason… If my memory serves, he’s the little brother of your lifesaver, right?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Yeah. I want Otouto-kun to think of me like a ‘dependable big sister’…~”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Mm—but if you’re the ‘big sister’ of my ‘Papa’, then you’ll be my ‘auntie’.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Eh!? I’m not old enough to be called that!</p><p>(<em>giggles</em>) Well I do want to get close to you like family… You may call me ‘Mama’, Shizu.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “……</p><p>…Tch…”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Eh, why did you click your tongue!? That sorta hurts…!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Oh, sorry. That was rude, huh? I’ll apologize.</p><p>Don’t worry, it wasn’t like I was thinking about how <em>someone like Kuromori-senpai should learn her place and not act like she’s on the same level as Hassaku-senpai. Don’t smugly call yourself my Mama, please.</em> Not at all.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Shizu~! You totally just confessed your true feelings! I have more maternity than you think, you know!? Look, look! (<em>doing some mysterious movements</em>)”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Stop acting stupid; we should get a move. I don’t know where Papa’s house is, is it in this complex?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “So I think. But sorry, while we’re walking I no longer have any idea where we are… I think, I’m kind of lost? Probably?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “For the love of… Fine then. I’ll just call Papa and ask him to pick us up.</p><p>Geez, it’s still early into the year and we’re already having troubles.”</p><h2 id="big-sister-and-daughter">Big Sister and Daughter</h2><h3 id="part-1">Part 1</h3><p><strong>Living Room</strong></p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Excuse us.</p><p>Ah, hello. Happy New Year, Papa~…</p><p>(<em>chuckle</em>) I’m sorry to intrude during new year.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Otouto-kun! Happy New Year! Suzu-oneechan is here to visit!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Kuromori-senpai, did you lose your chuuni somewhere on the way?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Don’t say <em>chuuni</em>! That’s my third most hated word in this world!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “How should I know? …Just curious, but what are the first and second?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “<em>That’s</em> where you’re biting? First is God, obviously! It’s all just an illusion the ignorant fools made up; while the second… Hmm? What was it again, Shizu?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Like I’d know.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Well, anyway! We shouldn’t be making a ruckus in front of the door; can we get inside? Shizu, do you have a change of clothes with you? You probably can’t relax in those.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Umm… I brought it in a paper bag, just in case. Furisode is hard to move in, so I’d personally like to change out of it quick.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “I see! Then you may change in the closet! It’s over here! &lt;<em>Come here</em>&gt;!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Acting like she owns the place… honestly, she’s been so strangely hyper today… I’m sorry for all the noise, Papa.</p><p>Huh, I look cute in furisode… you say? Thank you very much, Papa~”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Shizu, your attitude towards Otouto-kun is totally different from your attitude towards me, it’s like you’re two completely different persons! You can act more spoiled with me—O chick of broken-winged Lucifer…”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “If its wings were already broken as a chick, I don’t think it can survive the natural world. You just say whatever comes to your mind, seriously…</p><p>Then I’ll be changing for a bit. I’ll be borrowing the closet.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Should I help you change, Shizu? Furisode is hard to take off alone, right?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “That will be appreciated… I don’t know where to start with furisode.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hmm? Ah, we should come to your room after Shizu’s done changing, Otouto-kun? All right. You’ll be preparing tea and stuff for us while you wait, huh? Thanks for the hospitality!</p><p>Come on, Shizu, we’ll take that off quick! Can’t keep Otouto-kun waiting!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Wai—? Papa’s still here, don’t take my clothes off, please!”</p><p><strong>Room</strong></p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Hmm…</p><p>So in short, Kuromori-senpai will be taking care of Papa from today until the new term starts, right? And it’s all a request from that—who?—Kuromori-senpai’s so-called lifesaver.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Yeah. To be more precise, it’s Angie and her parents who asked me to.</p><p>Fortunately, I seem to be considered as Angie’s best friend. I’ve met her parents a few times too, and am on comfortable terms with the family.</p><p>They trust me enough to leave their precious ‘Otouto-kun’ in my hands.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “I don’t want to speak weirdly of people I don’t know—but which part of Kuromori-senpai is worth trusting in their eyes, I wonder? I mean, she’s a failure in society no matter where you look.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Well, I only became a Fallen Angel after Angie transferred out. Until then, I was just your run-of-the-mill gloomy schoolgirl; and I try to be polite in front of their parents.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “How you phrased it like ‘became a Fallen Angel’ is awfully suspicious enough.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “And anyway, Angie and her parents are perceptive people who can look into a person’s true worth. They must’ve sensed the pure brilliance of my soul!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Sure you want your ‘Fallen Angel soul’ to be pure and brilliant?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Oh, shut up. Anyway, that’s how it is. Their parents go on trips often, and Angie seems to be busy with something, so ‘this sort of thing’ happens often, I hear.</p><p>Usually, Otouto-kun’s childhood friend, Minami-san, gets to take care of him, but unluckily, she and family seem to be taking a trip to their hometown. And that’s how he ends up with me.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Hmm… I think if it’s Papa, he has a lot more options than just you, Kuromori-senpai…. You talk about taking care of him, but you’re useless with house chores, aren’t you?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “I may be useless right now, but I can learn! I mean, I’m in the middle of learning to cook already! Just leave it all to me, Otouto-kun! You can think of me as your ‘real older sister’ and act spoiled with me!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “I think being blood-related with someone like you is enough to make one want to die from shame. For one, you’re a full-on chuuni even though you’re third year in high school.</p><p>…But wait, if that’s the case, then why did you call me here? You don’t need me. I thought we were going to do another guerrilla live or something.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “No, but, uh… Otouto-kun is a healthy teenage boy, you know? Who knows what might happen if you leave us two <em>by ourselves</em> in a room?</p><p>Of course, I have faith in him! But there’s what society might think, and all!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “A Fallen Angel that cares about what society thinks… Mm, but yeah, I guess leaving a pair of man and woman to live under one roof for days is pretty risky.</p><p>Somebody needs to keep an eye on Papa so he won’t commit any adultery.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Just to make it clear, I’m not planning to stay over. I’ll go back home once it’s night! In short, I’m—what do you call it?—a commuting spouse!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “And now she’s claiming to be his spouse… Mm, it’s like I’m watching Papa having an affair… What to do, maybe I should give Mama a call?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “No, no. Hassaku-san is still being hospitalized, right? Don’t make her worry over your ‘affair’ business. It’s okay… Otouto-kun is a gentleman; nothing should go wrong.</p><p>Let’s all just be friends and enjoy this peaceful, temporary cohabitation# without trouble.</p><p>So that’s how it is! Incompetent though we may be, we’ll be sticking around for a while… Otouto-kun~”</p><h3 id="part-2">Part 2</h3><p><strong>Kodama Shrine’s Subsidiary</strong></p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Nyoon.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Chika-chan, over here!</p><p>Thanks for coming all the way to Onee-san’s hometown! Welcome!”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Nyoon! Nyoon! Nyoon!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Wai—it hurts, don’t hit me with your antenna! Onee-san <em>thinks</em> violence is not good! What’s wrong? Are you angry? Please return to the usual, kind Chika-chan!”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “It was faaaaaaaaaaaarrrr! Early in the morning, bottle-glasses contacted me asking <em>Let’s visit the shrine together~!</em> and I thought—<em>well, I had nothing to do anyways, so I might as well play nice</em>?—but I can see now that was a stupid idea!</p><p>I thought by shrine she meant the Kodama Shrine in the neighborhood, but turns out it’s the one in Chizu-chan-senpai’s hometown! And it’s awfully far! Can you imagine my surprise when she suddenly pushed me into the Shinkansen!?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Huh, did we forget to say? Yako-chan and I both are people from this area! Though Yako-chan is renting a room in an apartment near Kimisaki.</p><p>But I still live with my family, so everyday… I ride the Shinkansen to school. It’s quite a lot of trouble; well, I know I chose this for myself.</p><p>Chika-chan, can you think of it like a little out-of-town trip and have fun, maaybe?”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Nyuun… That’s asking too muuch. Theater Club just had training camp until yesterday, so I’m already tired of your faces. Didn’t I pretty much spend my entire break with the Theater Club?</p><p>Actually—I was planning to laze around from today until the new term starts. I was planning to sleep through my New Year! And you made me go on a journey around the island for noothing?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Shut your crap already. I paid for your tickets, so you didn’t lose anything from it, did you? Keep complaining and I won’t pay your transport fee back.”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Oh, please… I just received my New Year money so it’s not like I won’t be able to go home—but I don’t want to waste it all on transpoort… I want to buy new craft tools!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Craft tools… Chika-chaaaan, what about cosmetics and clothes?”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “I don’t need those… It’s not like I have anyone to show off to, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Eh, but there’s Transfer student-kun, right? Maaybe now’s a good chance to dress up and grab his heart? Love’s all about offense, Chika-cha~n!”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “I-I’m not in love, or anything? The relationship between Helpman and I can’t be summarized into such a cheap term it’s something more like the relationship of a master and servant kind-of, okay!?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “What the heck. Whatever. Chizuruuu… The both of us are pretty tired from the trip, can we rest before the shrine visit?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Yep, OK OK! It’s almost noon anyway; let’s take a rest in a café while having lunch. But it’s not very lively around these parts, so there aren’t many shops.</p><p>Should we at least pray for a bit then drop by my house, instead? You two will be staying over for a while, right?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Mm… Tomiko aside, are you sure I can stay?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “? Why? I’m happy to have you, you know, Yako-chan?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Mm… If worst comes to worst, I’ll just stay at my family house. I don’t really want to see Papa and Mama, but… well, they should be on a vacation outside the country around this time.”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Pft, bottle-glasses, you call your parents Papa and Mama, huh?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Huh? Is it strange…? I’ve been raised mostly abroad, so I just somehow took to calling them that. It’s not like I refer to them cutely because I love them so much, or that sorta thing.</p><p>More like I barely even remember their names.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Okay, this is going off to a gloomy direction, so we’ll stop talking about that!</p><p>So what do you say, girls? If you’re really that tired, I can go dash and see if there’s any shop we can visit. You both can sit somewhere around there and take a breather for the time being.”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Right… counting on you then. Y’see, Tomiko was sulking and wouldn’t walk on her own… so I pretty much had to drag her all the way here from the station. I’m beat.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Ahaha, that must’ve been tough… Oh, Chika-chan, you naughty girl!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “~…”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Hmm? Huh, Kodama-san!?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “…? Ah, Yakumo-san. Happy New Year.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Yep, Happy New year! Wowowow, what a nice coincidence! I didn’t think I’d see you in a place like this!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Yes, what a curious encounter. Or rather—we really do run into each other a lot.</p><p>Aah, right… Your house is around these parts, huh? I just recalled that you’ve told me about that over lunch; it’s all coming to me now.”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Nyoon! Hajime-oneesan, it’s your little sister, Tohmi Chika!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ahaha. Good day, Tohmi-san. I’m happy you like me so much, but I only have one little sister, Ichika.”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Kodama-saaan, HNY.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Konan-san. Yes, <em>HNY</em>, indeed… <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p><p>But what is the whole Theater Club doing here…? I… don’t believe you’re planning to continue your training camp so far out here, so do you have an event around, or?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “No, no; I just invited everyone to do the first shrine visit of the year in my hometown. I thought I’d show them the sights around these parts too, like a little fun tour, maaybe?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “A little tour? That sounds fun… Everyone in the Theater Club is always getting along so well. I’m envious.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Ehehe, don’t you think so? Kodama-san, how about joining us?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Oh, I’m happy for the invitation… but I’m sorry. I have a job to do here, so I don’t have much free time.”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Job? You’re working even over New Year? Talk about serious… Is it one of your shrine maiden jobs?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “You’re very quick on the uptake, Konan-san. You’re right; this shrine is a subsidiary of the Kodama Shrine… They’re planning to take it down, so I need to take care of the deity and stuff.</p><p>The demolition itself will be at the end of the year, but I need to make a list of what’s # and other things. It should be my parents’ job, but…</p><p>They’re currently busy flying all over the country for a ritual… so Ichika and I came to take care of it in their stead.</p><p>(<em>smiles</em>) Ichika seems to find it all bothersome, and has been complaining, though.”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Huh, lotsa places going out of business lately… But for a shrine to be closed down, this world sure is hopeless.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “(<em>chuckles</em>) Even if the shrine disappears, the deity is still left—even if the box disappears, the inside is still left—and even if matter disappears, as long as there is belief, then I’m sure it’s not the end. That’s what I’d like to think.”</p><h3 id="part-3">Part 3</h3><p><strong>Living Room</strong></p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Hmm… To be blunt: we have so surprisingly little to do.</p><p>Papa’s family didn’t leave a single chore to be taken care of… Make food and we’ll have nothing left to do.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Kukuku! What a mistake you have made, Clochette! This is the trap of sloth that God has assembled—He takes the potential of humanity from themselves and transform it all into sloth, so He may drop us all into the bottom of Hell!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Uh, it’s making everyday conversation hard, so can you take your chuuni somewhere else?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Laughable! No one may dye the color of another’s soul into something else! Let me raise in revolt to your foolish idea of twisting another person’s way of living to your liking! In short: no thanks!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Talk about selfish… You know you’re embarrassing the people with you, right?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “You’re embarrassed because you let yourselves think that way! Cast your shame aside, O Broken-Winged Lucifers, and scream out your entire existence to the world! Rock ‘n Roll!</p><p>Anyway, stop saying chuuni—can’t you see this stuff is cool? You can’t understand because you’re still a squirt, Shizu! Fuhahaha…!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Ouch ouch ouch!? Stop, Shizu! Stop hitting me rhythmically with those cooking chopsticks!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Ah, Papa… Can you please wipe dry all the plates that we’ve washed and return them to their place? We don’t know where we should put those, after all.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Right! It’s in your hands, Otouto-kun!</p><p>Hmm? The lunch we made was delicious… you say? Thank you! It was worth putting all that effort just to hear that from you!</p><p>Shizu was even less helpful than I thought, so it was tough just to make an easy dish… Look at this, see. I’ve been scrubbing this black, burnt part of the frying pan but it wouldn’t come off.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Mm… I’m sorry. I really can’t do much outside of playing drums.</p><p>Whaa? Please don’t pat my head, Papa… What? I should just grow on my own pace…?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “That is right! You have spoken the truth, Otouto-kun!</p><p>There’s no need to try so hard to learn to do <em>everything</em> in such a short time! We can watch for each other’s weaknesses! Even if it is nothing but licking each other’s wounds….!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Don’t just suddenly take a chuuni pose. Move your hands, please. Well, it’s just utensils for three people, we’ll finish washing in no time.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Yes. Well, really, there’s no need to hurry. Just do it ‘on our own pace’.</p><p>(<em>chuckles</em>) When we line up in front of the washing basin like this, it’s like we’re truly a pair of newly-married couple… Aah, Shizu’s seriously starting to look like a beloved daughter of mine~</p><p>Shizuku-cha~n? Thank you for helping me wash the dishes… Homehome~…”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Gya!? Eh, why did you kick me!? I’m against violence…!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Hmph… All right then, we’re done with the dishes. What should we do now? I don’t think we have any more left to do. I think we can even go home if we want.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hmm… But Otouto-kun must be lonely without his family home. I want to stay with him longer—I still want to play the role of his older sister more, or rather… I want to take care of him more.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Well, even if you’re saying you want to act like his big sis… What’s there to do? I’m an only child, so I don’t really understand.</p><p>Wait, I’ll look it up on my smartphone.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Oh, you’re such a modern-day girl, Suzu! You little~!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Don’t pinch my cheeks for no reason, please… What in the world is wrong with this person? She’s been so unbearable today… Did her nervousness in this unfamiliar situation made her lose a screw or two?</p><p>Hmm… After looking it up on my phone, lots of examples for a ‘model big sis’ came up. For the time being, why don’t you imitate them?</p><p>See here… It seems making this kind of pose then saying ‘Leave it all to Onee-chan!’ is popular lately.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Huh. I’ve seen that somewhere before.</p><p>Anyway, I hate imitating people, or acting out some kind of popular personality. It goes against my aesthetics. I’m seeking for something more authentic—I want to master the more basic principles there are about being a big sister.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “You’re asking for a lot… Hmm, well, it’s a bit simple but what about giving ‘lap pillow’? Looking up, I’m seeing lots of illustrations of a big sister-like character giving their little brother lap pillow.</p><p>Also, nannying.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Nannying!? Eh, eh—I don’t really get it but perverted stuff is not good…!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Mm, it’s nothing perverted, I think. Basically acceptance, motherly qualities, and warmth? Something of the sort. Those are kinda big sister-like, right?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hmm, this ‘big sister’ stuff is deep…!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Well, we have a lot of time, so why don’t you try out some of these as you like? Go for it until you’re satisfied, Kuromori-senpai.</p><p>I’ll go along to kill some time during the New Year break.”</p><h3 id="part-4">Part 4</h3><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Come to me, Otouto-kun.</p><p>Ehehe. You can act spoiled all you like to this Suzu-onee-chan…</p><p>I-Is this fine? Am I doing this right? Tell me, Shizu!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Stop going to me for everything, please. And stop moving so much, you’re giving him a lap pillow, after all… Keep moving like that and Papa’s head will slide off your lap to the floor.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Okay. I’ll try not to move. I’ll see what I can do. …Umm, can I pet Otouto-kun? I really want to! But uh, maybe it’s too high-technique for me?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “I dunno, play by the ear. Just do whatever you feel like, geez.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “I see. Then I’ll do what I like! Ehehe, you good boy…</p><p>You’re a good boy, Otouto-kun…”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> (Looking now that I’m calmer: what kind of situation is this… I mean, nothing wrong with peace I guess. Kuromori-senpai’s looking unnecessarily happy about it, and Papa’s relaxed too.</p><p>Papa’s usual position doesn’t give him much chance to be spoiled.</p><p>He assists the student council, and has to run all over to help all sort of people out… Papa’s always working to the bone…</p><p>In reality, maybe sleeping on someone’s lap and being patted on the head like that makes him happy. Please rest and take it slow, sometimes… at least during breaks.)</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “…Nhyaun!?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Ooh? What’s wrong, Kuromori-senpai? Don’t raise such a weird shriek… Did Papa touch you somewhere strange? Papa, there’s punishment for naughty children, you know?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “No, Otouto-kun’s fallen asleep… But I feel something vibrate. Ah, I think it may be smartphones…</p><p>It’s mine. Shizu, it’s hard for me to move with Otouto-kun sleeping on me… Sorry, but can you get my smartphone?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “You’re such a troublesome senpai… Let’s see… Ah, found it.</p><p>This is your smartphone, right? Uwah, it’s full of accessories.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hehe. Isn’t it cool? …Hmm, since it’s still vibrating, I guess it’s a call. Who’s it from?</p><p>Oh, it’s Yakobu. That’s rare; she’s usually too stingy with phone bills to make a call to anyone.</p><p>Hello, Yakobu? What’s up?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Yakobu… Aah, Konan-senpai from the Theater Club, huh. One of Kuromori-senpai’s few friends.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hm… Yeah… Well, I guess I’m free, yeah; but I have an important duty I must attend to… Right. Angie asked me to care for Otouto-kun.</p><p>Eh, then I should bring Otouto-kun with me? Ehh… but it’s break, so I wanted to let him rest for once… Right. Okay… Well, I’ll listen to what you have to say.</p><p>Ah, right. I got it, I got it. I owe a lot to you, after all. We’re friends, we should help each other in times of need. Right… Right. Understood. Leave it all to me.</p><p>See you then, Yakobu. I’ll hear out the rest when I get there. I might head to you alone at worst… Yeah. Once again… Happy New Year.</p><p>…Geez, she never changes, always such a troublemaker.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Kuromori-senpai~ What did Konan-senpai ask from you?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Right, I don’t really get it, but it seems she’s got trouble over at her hometown. Said something about some musical performance.</p><p>She’s already on the location, and moving around wastes time, so she wants me to bring her all the necessary stuff. And help out with the musical while I’m at it, she said.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “A <em>musical</em>… How is it turning into another wild situation again?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Like I’d know. But well, seems she’ll cover the train expenses, and she’ll pay us if the musical ends in success… Maybe it’ll be a good addition to our club’s budget for the next term.</p><p>It seems the stage will be a shrine, so we can do our first shrine visit of the year there too. Well, she told us to not be so nervous and just come over to play, think of it as a tour with close friends over break.</p><p>I was thinking to go alone, but I want Shizu and Otouto-kun to come to, if it’s fine with you guys. Seems there are small tasks to take care of; and you can be part of the show with your drum skills and singing, Shizu.</p><p>You can play drums all you want, y’know?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Hmm… I need to ask for my parents’ permission if it’s a far trip. But I’ll feel nervous if I just stay at home, so I think this is a good chance.</p><p>I can have a trip with Papa and everyone else… It seems fun, like a little adventure.”o</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “(<em>chuckles</em>) We’re just taking the Shinkansen to a place inside the country, so I’m not sure about adventure.</p><p>But I think we’ll end up having to stay over, so I’ll tell your parents for you.</p><p>I’ll say it’s a Rock Band Club activity. You know, training camp or the sort?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “I appreciate that. Well, my parents really spoil me, so I think they’ll be fine even if you say it’s a pleasure trip. I’m at the age where I can decide things for myself too… I’m in high school.</p><p>For once, I want to whatever I want without being indecisive!”</p><h3 id="part-5">Part 5</h3><p><strong>Inn (Living room)</strong></p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Yakobu! I’m here!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Ah, Kuromori-chan. Ossu, ossu! Sorry to have you come all the way here, it must’ve been tiring, right? <em>Seriously</em>, that Yako-chan! Always with her impossible demands~!”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hey, I don’t mind! It’s fine! Riding the Shinkansen was lotsa fun! It was my first time ever and it was super exciting! Y’know how fast it was that the view went <em>byuun!</em> Like <em>byuun</em>!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Ahaha! Geez, Kuromori-chan, you’re too excited! Instead of returning to your original personality, <em>maaybe</em> you went a little too far back to being a toddler?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “……!? Don’t so casually address me, Bi*ch!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “No way!? I’m not a bi*ch! I just fall in love easily!”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Hey, what’s all the noises for… We’re not in Kimisaki. You can’t be bothering the other guests, damnit.</p><p>…Oh, you got here fast, Kuro. Sorry for asking for your help out of the blue.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “It’s fine. Aren’t we friends? By the way, it was impossible to carry all the stuff you asked by myself, so I asked a delivery service and I think it’ll arrive a little late. Probably around early morning tomorrow?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Got it. Thanks for that, you really saved me. Have all the rest you want today. I’ll explain you the details tomorrow.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Kuromori-senpai~ Don’t go ahead by yourself, please. We don’t know the room number either, so if you leave us alone we’ll be completely lost.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Ah, sorry… This is the room we’ll be staying! Shizu, Otouto-kun, you should greet everyone! We’ll be in their care for a while, fuhahaha!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Ah, hello… I’m Fujii Shizuku, from the Rock Band Club. I’ll be in your care.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Oh, how polite~ Umm, is it just Kuromori-chan and Shizuku-chan from the Rock Band Club? As for Seira-chan and the rest… I guess they can’t come in such a short notice, huh?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Yes… We did call them, but they seem busy with the new year. They said they’ll catch up if they can later, but since it’s far and all, I think that’ll be difficult.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “I see… OK, OK! I know maaybe it was a pretty unreasonable demand, so having you guys come here at all <em>is</em> something to be grateful for!</p><p>Nyufufu. Shizuku-chan, you don’t seem well, do you? Did the long trip tire you out, maaybe?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “No… Kuromori-senpai was so energetic, it was tiring just to keep up with her. While we were riding on the Shinkansen, she kept yelling and stuff. She’s one Fallen Angel to deal with.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Ahaha~ Kuromori-chan has that childish side to her, huh?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “What, got any complaint, Bi*ch? …Ah, Otouto-kun. Thanks for carrying our luggage.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Transfer student-kun, welcome! We’re waiting for you, maaybe! Guys, put away your luggage and have a rest. I’ll pour some tea for you!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Ah, no need for the trouble… Umm, are we all going to stay in the same room?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “We have more than one room! For one, we can’t have Transfer student-kun sleep with us. It’s pretty abandoned around these parts, and they have lots of empty rooms, so we were able to borrow a few for cheap.</p><p>But you know, it must lonely to just kill time at each rooms alone, right? Maaybe? So well, we’re all gathering here until it’s time to sleep.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hmm. To think we can stay in such a nice inn for free—what a luxury!”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “But we’ll work you hard to make up for it, obviously~ Though you guys are helping us out of your good will… so I wouldn’t push that many demands to you, relax.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “There it is~! Yako-chan’s totally unreliable consolation words: saying stuffs like ‘relax’ at the beginning only to make all sorts of unreasonable demands later anyway!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> &quot;(<em>chuckles</em> ) Konan-san can be like that sometimes, huh?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Whoa!? Don’t erase your presence and sneak up from behind me!</p><p>You are… Kodama Hajime…! You came, huh!? You arrogant, sham of a priestess, falsely presenting yourself as a God…!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “I’m… not a God. At the very least, I’ve never truly claimed myself as such, Kuromori-san.</p><p>We were both ‘student council president candidates’, but we never really talked, right? …Do you hate me, perchance?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hmph… I <em>despise</em> people like you—fake saints pretending to be pure, acting like you’re the only one without any sin in the world! Aah, how unpleasant! Why must you be here!?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Well, Kodama-san’s the reason we’re all here, so it’s natural she’d be <em>here</em>. By the way, she’s paying for our inn stay too, so you’d better watch your words.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “No, it’s not so much <em>me</em> as it’s the Kodama branch shrine.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hmm? I don’t really get the situation, so I can’t understand even if you babble all that stuff at me! I think I’d rather have you explain everything first anyway!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “(<em>chuckles</em>) Now now, no need to be so hurried. Let’s all sit and relax…</p><p>They say ghosts would drop by noisy places at night, you know, Kuromori-san? There’s a hot spring here too, so you can take a bath and wash away your sweat first.</p><p>I think you can wash away all the negative feelings too. If you enter a nice, warm bath, I’m sure you’ll feel all the irritation and anger disappear.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hah! Whatever you say sounds like preaching! This is why I can’t stand shrine maidens and nuns and the like—all you fake clergies!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “If <em>she</em> sounds preaching, you’re much worse off, Kuromori-senpai…</p><p>But well, what a weird gathering… Rock Band Club, Theater Club, and a shrine maiden?</p><p>It seems we’ll really have a wild start to the year, huh… Papa?”</p><h2 id="shrine-visit">Shrine Visit</h2><h3 id="part-1-2">Part 1</h3><p><strong>Kodama Branch Shrine</strong></p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Good morning, Transfer student-kun. Did you have a good sleep last night?</p><p>Fufu. Are you taking a morning walk to get rid of the sleepiness? But it’s really chilly in the morning, so I think you can wear more layers of clothes.</p><p>And it’s an unknown area for you, too, so you might end up lost going off by yourself. There are lots of people who will be sad over your disappearance, so please take care.</p><p>(<em>chuckles</em>) I’m sorry to lecture you so early in the morning. This isn’t good; it seems I’m becoming more talkative.</p><p>I tend to worry over little details, and fuss over every little thing… I’m the older sister of a certain ‘adorable little sister’ who’s prone to failure, after all.</p><p>But if I keep being so wordy, maybe people will hate me… Hmm? What’s wrong? Why are you staring at me like that?</p><p>Huh? ‘I see, this is how a big sister is like’… you say? What does that mean? This is a little hard… Hmm~?</p><p>I see. I don’t really understand, but Kuromori-san is acting as your ‘big sister’ right now, huh? Do you want me to give her an advice, since she seems so troubled over it?</p><p>(<em>chuckles</em>) I should show her what a big sister is like, you say? I wonder~ I don’t think it’s something to be taught.</p><p>In the end, I’m just <em>Ichika’s</em> older sister. The only one who knows how to be <em>your</em> older sister is the person herself, or you, who know her well.</p><p>When you think about it like that, aren’t the Theater Club girls amazing? They can get into any kind of role. I often watch their rehearsals and shows too… and I’m amazed every time.</p><p>I wonder what it’s like… Not just how you were born, or how you were raised… but sometimes, your gender and race would differ per role too. To see through the eyes, hear through the ears, feel through the skin—and live the life of someone completely different from you…</p><p>I wonder, how does that feel? I’m the successor shrine maiden for the Kodama Shrine, sometimes revered as the Living God—I’ve always lived inside the frame people set up for me.</p><p>But those girls go beyond their own frame and live with freedom. They always appear so bright to me… I feel like I’ve been envious of them for so long.</p><p>(<em>chuckles</em>) I’m sorry. I think I’m still a little sleepy. I ended up blathering something vague.</p><p>…Yes, as you can see, I’m cleaning the shrine.</p><p>The person taking care of this shrine is not currently available. So I’ve been deployed to replace them for the time being. As the representative of Kodama Shrine, I have the duty to maintain this branch well.</p><p>In the first place, cleaning early in the morning is a daily activity for me. So doing the same activity as usual, at the usual time, really calms me.</p><p>It’s the season for shrine visits, so there are many litters around; someone needs to sweep and clean up. I want everyone to greet a new year, a new day, in a neat environment.</p><p>That’s why we have big cleaning at the end of the year, and that’s why I’m sweeping the place with a bamboo broom right now.</p><p>Hmm? You’re going to help, Transfer student-kun?</p><p>Thank you. This shrine hasn’t been taken care of for a long time; it’s abandoned and rather dirtied… It’s tough to clean everything myself.</p><p>I’m really saved, but is it okay? You’re always helping people out, so if you ever find yourself thinking ‘I can’t take it’ or ‘too much’, I think you should rest, or talk to someone.</p><p>Because you see, that was what I failed to do for a long time… and it was so hard.</p><p>Oh. I see. So you’re okay. You’re having fun and you’re happy. Then I’m really glad.</p><p>Fufu.

But it was Hii-chan who gave it to you, so…?</p><p>(<em>chuckles</em>) I guess I really shouldn’t do things that are out of character, huh?</p><p>Once again… Let’s work hard cleaning together, Transfer student-kun~”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Hmm? Ah, you’re right. There’s Ichika next to the warehouse?

It’s January 5th already, so I don’t think you can call any sunrise the first of the year anymore.”</p><p>(…Thank goodness. She’s a little weird, but she’s still the usual Ichika.</p><p>I don’t feel any strange presence, so maybe she really <em>was</em> just a little sleepy.)</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “What’s wrong, Onee-chan? You’re staring with this kind of mushy-squashy gaze?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Mushy-squashy? No, I’m just thinking how you’re your usual self, Ichika~…”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “Who else would I be~? Aren’t you still dozed off, Onee-chan? You seem to think you have everything in control, but you’re always acting like a silly airhead in the morning, you know.</p><p>Huh? There’s Transfer student senpai! Right, apparently you joined us last night or something? I was asleep back there, so learning that the morning after kinda surprised me!</p><p>Eh? Ah, yes. Happy New Yea~r…?</p><p>Uh, huh? Wait, what’s up with this? Transfer student senpai being around <em>surely</em> has no connection with Onee-chan looking happy, right!? Ugh, I feel a disturbance inside my chest…!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ichika, stop looking like you’re ready to kill with that bamboo broom. Sheesh, you’re such a strange child.”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “Well, about that… I’m <em>your</em> little sister, after all.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ah, that was sarcasm, right? Even <em>I</em> understand that. I’m strange, so of course my little sister who shares my blood would be strange, that’s what you meant, right?”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “See? You’re always so prickly in the morning, Onee-chan! And for some reason, during mornings you think we’d be late, you’d be cutting ingredients to make miso without stop!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “My, my? Just as I thought it was a little lively…?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “…Oh, Yakumo-san. Ahaha, you caught me in an embarrassing state.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “No? I’m jealous since you sisters seem to be so close! I’m an only child, after all. I want a little sister, or an older sister too!”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “I-I’m not giving my Onee-chan to anyone, okay? She’s <em>my</em> Onee-chan only! Forever!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “I’m not taking her~ Well, I, Yakumo Chizuru, am everyone’s reliable Onee-san in the Theater Club, see! So I welcome any girls wanting to be my little sister!</p><p>Ehehe! Leave it all to Onee-san!”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Ah. That’s the one. I thought I’ve seen that somewhere before, so it was you, Bi*ch.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Maaybe you can tell me what you mean? And please drop that bi*ch calling already! At least call me Yakumo-san like in the past!”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Yeah. You know, that word is actually a worse insult than Japanese people think.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Yako-cha~n, you’re so late. You arrived even later than Kuromori-chan, who’s weak at sports… You have not tempered yourself enough, young woman! Look and learn from Onee-san!”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “No, no. This brat stopped moving in the middle, so I dragged her by her cowlick.”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Nyoon!? Ouch ouch ouch! My cowlick isn’t a leash and I’m not a dog, okaay!? I’ll sue you for corporal punishment someday…!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Wow, you’re all gathered… What were you all doing, with such seemingly cold clothes?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Nyufufu! It’s my routine to go running early morning. But my home’s far from school, so when I think I’ll be late, I run at night and not in the morning.</p><p>Stamina is what an actress needs, after all. I’m a still a learning chick, but I mean to always be an actress at heart… Ah, wasn’t that line just now maaybe kinda like A Little Princess!?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “You mean that line about how her heart’s always like a princess? Well, that’s just like you~… Ah geez, I end up wasting so much energy in the morning.</p><p>I meant to run just to shake off the sleepiness, but she made me run for kilos.</p><p>I don’t really return here often so I don’t know which way leads where, too… If I gave up in the middle, I wouldn’t be able to return to the inn, and ended up dead on the roadside. Really regretted this one.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ahaha. So you all joined in Yakumo-san’s morning routine and went jogging.”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Yeah. We woke up a little too early, and there’s still some time until breakfast. Though the girl with Kuro… Shizu, was it? She’s still asleep, looking tired from the long trip, so we left her at the inn.”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “I-I was sleeping too but you kicked me awaake! What’s with this discrimination…!? Why can’t you be kind to your people, bottle-glasses!?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Shut up. You’re always acting so spoiled, anyway. If at least <em>I</em> don’t treat you harshly, you’re gonna rot into a useless girl. Y’know what they call this: carrot and stick.”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Nyoon! Helpmaaan! Hajime-onee-saaan! Please save my poor, pitiful self being abused by this demon! If this keeps up, my cowlick’s going to wilt from the stress!”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “That thing can wilt? You think it’s a plant or something? …Kodama-san, it seems you’re cleaning. Should we help?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Yeah, yeah! We just kinda went with the flow, but you paid for everyone’s stay at the inn! We’ll offer you our service to make up for that~ Meow, meow!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “…<em>Meow meow</em>?</p><p>(<em>chuckles</em>) I don’t really get it, but it’ll end in no time if you’ll all help me. Ah, no… I’m sure whatever hardship in front of us, it’ll all be just a piece of cake.</p><p>Thank you. Everyone in Kimisaki Academy is so nice… I’m so glad you’re here, really. And I’m proud to be one of you.”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “You’re always so stiff, huh… You know what they say about hypocritical courtesy? Honestly, I think just a ‘thank you’ should cut it.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Yes. I guess you’re right. Thank you, everyone~…”</p><h3 id="part-3-2">Part 3</h3><h3 id="part-4-2">Part 4</h3><h3 id="part-5-2">Part 5</h3><h2 id="secrets">Secrets</h2><h3 id="part-1-3">Part 1</h3><h3 id="part-2-3">Part 2</h3><h3 id="part-3-3">Part 3</h3><h3 id="part-4-3">Part 4</h3><h3 id="part-5-3">Part 5</h3><h3 id="part-6">Part 6</h3><h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Homehome is Shizuku’s trademark SFX(?) for when she’s rewarding people for their achievements.
