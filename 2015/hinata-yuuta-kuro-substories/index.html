I’m thankful for the chance, sir! Today I’ll go with the strategy I’ve been thinking up for quite a while! Fufufu~</p><p>I’d love to see the surprised look on your face, Boss! Eat this – my finishing move…!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “It’s okay to shout, since it put more strength on your fist. But use your limbs more than your mouth, you simpleton!”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “Oggu!? On the solar plexus… (<em>cough</em>, <em>cough</em>)!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I’m not sure what sort of finishing move you’ve thought of, but the key to victory is to not let your opponent do anything.</p><p>Don’t look at yourself; look at your opponent well, and do what he wouldn’t like.</p><p>You okay, Tetsu? I might’ve put too much strength in the punch.”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “(<em>cough</em>, <em>cough</em>) I’m okay! Ugh… One more time, please!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Sure. Still, clashing continuously would make me tired too. Let’s take a short break and…</p><p>Hmm?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “That’s as far as you go!</p><p>You must be this Academy’s strongest, Kiryuu Kurou! I can’t have you feel satisfied just by taking down small fries!</p><p>Next <em>I</em> shall be your opponent! Yaccho~☆”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Ouch ouch ouch – <em>stop!</em> Don’t grab me hard on the face like that! I give I give I give!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…What’s with you, came to challenge our dojo or somethin’? I’ll take the fight you’re picking, bastard.”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “T-T-That’s not it! Seeing the two of you have a heart-to-heart through clashing your fists tickled my boyish spirit, I just couldn’t resist!</p><p>Please let me off! I’m against violence!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Hmm. The transfer student little miss. Is this idiot with you?</p><p>Do you have some business with me?</p><p>I don’t really get it, but I can’t refuse you, lil’ miss.</p><p>Oi, Tetsu. Prepare tea for our guests. How long are you planning to lay around like that? Stand up. You’re a man, aren’t you?”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “O-Ossu! But the only tea we have is the one in the flask; it’ll be an indirect kiss!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “What are you, a maiden? Then go buy some.”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “Ossu! Anything for you, Boss! I’m off then~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “We’re in no hurry, just be careful… Anyway, if you need something from me, just say it, miss.”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Ah, Transfer student-san was only showing me to you! It’s me who have something to ask from you!</p><p>You see~ I’m in this unit called 2wink with my younger twin brother…</p><p>Lately, that brother, Yuuta-kun, has been complaining about our outfit, see~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “2wink, huh. Come to think of it, I did make the outfit for that. So you didn’t like it. Which part bothers you?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Hee~ I did hear from Transfer student-san, but you’re <em>really</em> the one making costumes and stuffs, Kiryuu-senpai?</p><p>Ahaha! I guess you can’t judge books by their covers~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I’m sewing as hobby – is that bad? What, you have any complaint?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Spare me, I have not! No I mean, <em>I</em> like it, see, that outfit.</p><p>But Yuuta-kun seems to be thinking something along the lines of, ‘I hate how we’re wearing similar outfits just because we’re twins! I need my own individuality!’, you know?</p><p>But since that outfit looks great on Yuuta-kun…</p><p>If someone’s going to be different and change their outfit or hairdo, I think it should be me.</p><p>If we twins wear different outfits, I’m sure Yuuta-kun will feel satisfied too~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Isn’t being twins your selling point in 2wink? You guys look best in symmetry.</p><p>That said, I can’t insist when the person in question doesn’t like it. Then why don’t you try on a few outfits as test?</p><p>I have almost all the other units’ idol outfits and stuffs. I’ll go get them, so take off your clothes while you wait.</p><p>Oi, lil’ miss. Look the other way. There’s nothing interesting looking at some guy change, right?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Ooh, I’m grateful for your enthusiasm in this! You like dressing people up, huh?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You won’t get clothes until you wear them, after all. Look. Judging by your stature, this should fit you well, shouldn’t it?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Ooh, Ra*bits! It’s so cute~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You’re in the Light Music Club, right? Then you might get used to this one too.”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Hyaho, UNDEAD! I’ve dreamed to wear this! Makes me feel a little baddish~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “We’ve got others. You should tell me if there’s any you like best.</p><p>I’ll decide on the direction based on that and make you a new outfit.”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Waai, 'fine’!</p><p>Akatsuki!</p><p>Trickstar!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Wanna try changing hairstyle too? I’ll give you a little make-up if you want. I have some accessories too. It’s gotten pretty fun…~”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Uwah, your eyes totally look serious! You’re plainly more into this than the karate practice just then, aren’t you, Kiryuu-senpai!?</p><p>Well, do whatever you want~ And take it easy. I don’t really need it immediately, anyway.</p><p>But someday. There might come a day where Yuuta-kun and I will walk different paths. This is like rehearsal for that.</p><p>You can make me your dress up mannequin l as you like~ Though… I’ll be happiest if he and I can walk on the same path.</p><p>Ahaha. Somehow I’m feeling a bit lonely, the tears just come out…~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Hey, you – are you interested in crossdressing?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “I don’t have any plan on walking <em>that</em> path!</p><p>Ahaha – but now the loneliness has just flew somewhere!</p><p>It’s gotten fun for me too~ Thanks, Kiryuu-senpai!

It’s not like we’re being marketed like two as a set.”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “Ah… then I’m sorry about that. Anyway, what are you doing standing around like that?

It’s the younger of the twin, Yuuta-kun. He was loitering outside the dojo, so I brought him along with me!</p><p>Should I haven’t?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Hmm, if you ask that, I guess you shouldn’t have. But well, this is just how stuffs turned out.</p><p>Hey, the younger one of the twin… Yuuta, was it? Well, you sit over there.

I’ve made my gallant entrance, clad in the outfit of our Academy’s prided unit of traditional arts, Akatsuki!”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “W-W-W-Wha…? What are you doing, you idiot Aniki!?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Uwaa, Yuuta-kun! Why are you here!? You’re wrong, I’m not being unfaithful to you!”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Aniki! I scolded you a little then you sulked, going ’<em>Huhu, you hate me now, don’t you, darling!?’</em> and ran off somewhere…</p><p>So I was wondering where and what you were doing, and I got <em>this…</em>!? W-Why are you wearing the Akatsuki outfit?</p><p>Aaah, I see, is that how is it, sir?! You’re backing down from 2wink and entering Akatsuki? Sure, like I care! You’re just hindering 2wink’s activity anyway!”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Y-You’re wrong~… Yuuta-kun, you didn’t seem to like wearing the same outfit as me, so…</p><p>I’m asking Kiryuu-senpai and Transfer student-san to make me a new outfit!”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Aah, I think we did have that kind of talk…? But why are you asking Kiryuu-senpai to make the outfit?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Well, most of the unit outfits are my work. Sewing is my hobby, see…</p><p>So how was it? You tried on a lot, but was there any outfit you like?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Hmm~ I think I’m most accustomed to the 2wink one, after all. But Yuuta-kun, you hate wearing the same outfit as me, right?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Aniki, you idiot!”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Oof!? To think you’d come at me with a drop kick without leaving room to argue!</p><p>You sure have packed more punch, Yuuta-kun! No wait, in this case, it should be 'packed more kick’ huh, fufufu…☆”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Why do you look so happy about it…</p><p>Hey, Aniki? It’s true I hate having everything and anything 'the same as Aniki’, but being 'twins’ is our strength, isn’t it?</p><p>That’s what you always say, isn’t it, Aniki? I’m frustrated by it, but I agree. It’s our unique trait, our merit, our weapon – so what are you trying to gain by throwing that away?’</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> &quot;Yu-Yuuta-kun…?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “You don’t have to go out of your way to change your appearance. I can outsail the idiot Aniki anytime!</p><p>I’m sure our difference will come through, someday for sure! But it’s still too difficult for that right now.</p><p>I’m just really frustrated and vexed by that fact, that I’m angry at myself! Understand at least that much. You’ve been by my side since we were born!”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Yuuta-kun…</p><p>I see… of course. Ahaha! I’ve been a little worried because you’re showing rebellious tendencies lately, Yuuta-kun! L-Like, maybe you hate me~ or something.”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Geez, I don’t hate you, Aniki. We’re family, right? You can be really annoying sometimes though. But even that’s not to the point I’d break off relations with you, you know?</p><p>Well, that’s how it is. I’m sorry my idiot Aniki has been troubling you. We’re still going to go as 2wink… as twins for a little longer.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I see. Well, everything’s good if you family get along. If you guys have any trouble just lightly consult me.</p><p>'A design that makes best use of the fact we’re twins, while still stressing the difference, where we enhance each other’ kind of thing seems pretty fun too, eh?</p><p>Actually, I really wanted to sew, y’know. Now that my creative urge got worked up for nothing, what do I gotta do with it?</p><p>…Oi, the transfer student lil’ miss. What have you been up to in that corner since a while ago?</p><p>Aah, the older twin was changing so you were trying to not look, huh? I guess girls would worry about that stuff.</p><p>My little sister’s the same. Sorry for not noticing. As apology, I’ll tailor an outfit for your use, lil’ miss.</p><p>I’ll dress you up into all kinds of outfits. I’ve been wanting to design for women as a change of pace.</p><p>It seems 2wink doesn’t need any new outfit yet, after all~”</p><hr><h2 id="aoi-yuuta">Aoi Yuuta</h2><h3 id="older-brother-and-younger-brother">Older brother and Younger brother</h3><p>&gt; Light Music Club Room</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Ooi, Aniki~?</p><p>…He’s not in the Light Music Club room either, huh.</p><p>Geez, where could he have gone, that idiot Aniki? He <em>annoyingly</em> gets in my hair when I don’t need him around me, yet when I <em>do</em> need him he’s nowhere!</p><p>Ah, 'scuse me, Transfer student-senpai. What are you doing here? Are you lost?</p><p>Hmm. So, for your producer work to go smoother…</p><p>…You got a master key that can enter any room in this Academy from Sagami-sensei, is it?</p><p>During that recent ruckus… DDD, you did play a pretty active role. So it’s like you’ve gotten more authority, huh? That’s commendable. I respect you~</p><p>That means you’ve gained trust from the teachers, right?</p><p>Nah, though Sagami-sensei is pretty loose on that area, so the chance that he’s just not thinking of anything is high too.</p><p>But next time, if I want to sneak into some place, I’ll rely on you, Senpai. No, see, Aniki does pranks often so there are times we need to hide from the student council.</p><p>It’ll help a lot if you can open the lock of some random room and shelter us there, Senpai~</p><p>No, I mean… yeah. It’ll be easy if I can make Aniki stop his pranks, but I won’t exhaust myself like this if he listens to what I say. That stupid Aniki is always, always like that…!</p><p>Right, right – have you seen Aniki somewhere? I’m looking for him.</p><p>Well, usually I’m the one who goes around avoiding and running away from Aniki. But I have to meet him right now.</p><p>There’s a job for our unit… 2wink. I want to consult Aniki about it.</p><p>For once, Aniki is 2wink’s leader, after all. For us to accept or reject a job, I need Aniki’s approval and signature.</p><p>Aniki is pretty bad with that sort of annoying procedure.</p><p>If that’s the case, then I could’ve just been leader, but it was like, 'I’m the older brother, so I’m the more amazing one!’ and now look…</p><p>I’m sorry. I ended up complaining!</p><p>Maybe I should just sign in place of Aniki? Our handwriting are pretty much the same anyway; I’m sure amateur can’t tell them apart~</p><p>Pantomime… This job is just trying to sell us as twins more.</p><p>Aniki would probably be happy, but maybe I should just reject this on my own? I don’t want to keep being marketed as a set with Aniki.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Kukuku, you’re at an age full of worries, are you not, Yuuta-kun~”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Uwooh, so you were there, Prez!? Why are you inside that locker?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Yes. I was sleepy, see, so I mistook this for the coffin I usually used as bed and got in here instead.</p><p>I was troubled because I cannot get out. So I pleaded for help to the young lady, who just happened to pass by.”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Aah, I understand why Transfer student-senpai is in this club room now.</p><p>Don’t fall into a pinch over such stupid reason, please. You’re not yet at the age to go senile, are you?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “I’m terribly sorry about that… Since I seem to have lost face anyway, would you care to pull me out?</p><p>If I stay like this, I might be trapped in this locker forever and turn into a mummy.”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Isn’t it too out there for a vampire to become a mummy? Geez.</p><p>…Then I’m pulling you out now. There~”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Phew. You have saved me.</p><p>The transfer student young lady by herself would be too powerless to do anything, but I wanted to refrain from showing my shameful side to those outside my circle, yes?</p><p>Still – I have overheard your talk a little, and I’m quite interested. It appears the position of a 'younger brother’ is also one full of worries.</p><p>However, I would like you to understand the hardships of the 'older brother’ too~”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Aah… Come to think of it, you have a little brother in Yumenosaki too, don’t you, Prez.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Yes. Coincidentally, it appears the transfer student young lady has a younger brother of her own. He seems to go to this Yumenosaki Academy’s normal course.</p><p>I would love to catch glimpse of him at least once~”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Hmm. So you’re an 'Onee-chan’, huh, Transfer student-senpai. Maybe I should call you 'Onee-chan’ too…~</p><p>Then I’ll represent the 'younger brothers’ and say this. Don’t play around with us too much.</p><p>We’re not accessories or servants for you 'older brothers’ and 'younger sisters’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>, you know?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “That certainly strikes home, yes. Then allow me to say this to you as an 'older brother’ too.</p><p>We think of 'younger brother’ as a part of our body, that’s just born a little later than us. An important, important part of our flesh as well as our heart.</p><p>And so they would not be hurt, so they would not taste the same failure as we did - as someone who has walked a little further than them, we cannot help but fuss over them.</p><p>In case of brothers, especially. Manly pride and the sort tend to get in the way. We cannot help but want to look cool.</p><p>We want to show off to our 'younger brother’ for being able to do what they can’t.</p><p>We want to be told 'Awesome!’ so we can act the older brother and say 'I’ll teach you how it’s done’.</p><p>The Aoi big brother… Hinata-kun. Is that not how he is, as well?</p><p>He has been rather eager in practicing lately. Until just now, it seems he has been doing lessons with the transfer student young lady.</p><p>He was saying, 'Yuuta-kun is growing in great speed, so I can’t lose too!’, seemingly quite into it, you know?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “How about you accept that Pantomime job? You see, we older brothers are always happy to do something together with our younger brother.</p><p>We’d even push ourselves to the limit in order to show off to our younger brother, you see?</p><p>And as your older brother do that, you should chase after his back, and just sometimes, tell him 'Awesome!’ – praising him.</p><p>In your case, unlike with me, the two of you are still walking the same path. Do you not think averting your eyes is quite lonely?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “…That’s true. Even if someday we’ll walk different paths… That’s not yet the case now.</p><p>Thank you very much, Prez. I’ve come to understand an 'older brother’s feelings a little.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Thank me not; us old men simply love preaching people, see. In short, what I wanted to say is, brothers are best getting along well.”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Yes!</p><p>Transfer student-senpai, please take me to the place Aniki is practicing.</p><p>I’m going to practice together with him. At least so I wouldn’t be left behind too much. Stuffs relating to what we’ll do from then on to the future, I’ll think only after I catch up with Aniki.”</p><p>*Other notes. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Uhh I don’t know how to translate it, but Tetora is just singing some made up song about eating. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p></li><li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>It says younger sister, but I wonder if it’s not a typo of older sister…?
