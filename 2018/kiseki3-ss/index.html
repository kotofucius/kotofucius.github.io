We’re doing this until morning?</p><p>…I didn’t hear about that. Ibara, did you properly prepare the script?</p><p>…I’m worried that I won’t be able to stay in-character until morning without a script.</p><p>…There’s been an overhaul to my character since Autumn Live too, and I haven’t fully adapted yet.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Whoops! Your Excellency, lower your voice when you say such things, please!</p><p>Excuse me~ Can the editing team do this to that part just now?♪ (<em>makes a cutting motion with his hand</em>)”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “They’re already encountering recording problems. Is Eden doing fine…?</p><p>No, maybe it’s all their calculated act? If so, they are very fearsome.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Sometimes, I also get scared thinking all that comedic airheadedness might be your calculated act, Hidaka-kun… Honestly, I think you’re a genius.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “? Thank you. I’m happy you complimented me.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hey, hey! Since we’re just getting started, how about we throw out that one just now and record from the start again?</p><p>Oh, but this was live, wasn’t it?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “We do pretend it’s live debate, but it shouldn’t actually be live~</p><p>Our agency doesn’t allow that, so they wouldn’t have accepted the job.”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/hyI7146.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Well, we’re high school students with unstable output.</p><p>The agency prefers to be excessively cautious and avoid the occurrence of unpredictable situations when they can.</p><p>And, as a matter of fact, we would catch a cold, debating in these cold winds until morning! A foul weather!</p><p>It feels like we might freeze over! It’s right before SS, so I’d prefer to not hurt my throat.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. It’s midwinter, so it’s still cold even with a heater. …Honestly, why the rooftop of all places?”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I do enjoy the nice view, though.</p><p>…Ah. Look, look; there’s greenery budding amidst the snow.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Ooh, then spring might be coming in no time! Where is this bud you speak of? I’d like to see it as well! I’d like to share the same sights as His Excellency…☆</p><p>Aah, might it be…? Is it next to that stone pillar, rumored to be a memorial for those lost to suicide? Mr. Cameraman, zoom to that side if you please!”</p><p><strong>Announce:</strong> &lt;First question.</p><p>Why did you all choose to become idols?&gt;</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Did you just ignore the flow of our conversation to get on with the program, Anzu-san!? As always, you can’t seem to take a hint! Aah, I meant it in a good way!</p><p>But really, it is a relief to see that you are back on your feet already♪</p><p>I heard that you got hospitalized for some time!</p><p>I was <em>really</em> worried for you, Anzu-san.

I’m impressed; Eden’s really precise in the cards they play.</p><p>I’d hate for another Summer Live to happen, so I need to research how far Eden has gone with their plans, before the event.</p><p>I think that’s more worthwhile than spending my break spacing out.</p><p>I <em>can</em> get the same results just through researching social medias, but that would have taken more time…</p><p>And I get a better feel of the situation by actually searching the scene, anyway.</p><p>Check the scene of the crime a hundred times!

So you noticed. You’re so sharp, Ritsu-kun.</p><p>Umm, Izumi-san, here… I bought this just then from that shop over there.</p><p>It’s a Christmas present, to thank you for the muffler.</p><p>I was caught up with a lot of things around Christmas and had no time to prepare anything, so I couldn’t give you anything back that time… It’s late, but will you accept?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Eh… W-What is it?

It’s that cosmetic product Yuu-kun and I modeled the commercial for long ago…☆</p><p>Sooo nostalgic! Ahaha, I recall it had this silly catchphrase like, ‘Even boys want to be pretty’ or something…♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah. Isn’t it nostalgic~? I didn’t think they’d still be selling such an old stuff…</p><p>It was a fresh concept when it first came out, though. Cosmetics for grade schoolers—for boys, even.</p><p>Fufu.

Can you not forge false memories, Yuu-kun!?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha.

It’s embarrassing! It’s just, I was having a weird misunderstanding back then!</p><p>So they showed me around a place where they did special makeup effects, for future reference, you know?</p><p>There, I saw people’s faces looked like they melted when the makeup was applied…</p><p>And I was scared thinking it might happen to me. Looking back now, I was being incredibly dumb.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Ahaha. So there was a time you were adorable, Secchan♪”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Hmph. I bet you were an uncute and cold brat since the past, Kuma-kun.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Yep. My current self is a hundred times cuter than my old self…☆”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Where did that confidence even well up from? You’re impossible… Well, back to topic. In the end, we dealt with the photo shoot without the makeup, didn’t I?</p><p>Even if it was a cosmetic commercial, it’s not like the models <em>had</em> to wear the cosmetic.</p><p>I think they made the right choice~ It wouldn’t be funny if our developing, smooth skin got messed up by some cosmetics.</p><p>Even without makeup, back then we were angels manifold more beautiful and adorable than some random models…♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “It <em>did</em> have great feedback.</p><p>It’s not all thanks to us of course, but it seems to have become popular enough to still be sold even to this day.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Yeah, that was a huge success.

But would it be crass to point it out in this case?)</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Fufu. Yuu-kun, you had this puzzled look, like wondering ‘<em>What’s wrong?</em>’ ‘<em>We’re not doing the photo shoot?</em>’… and were staring at me with beautiful, pure eyes.</p><p>Your eyes couldn’t seem to recognize that I was goofing up.</p><p>Your face couldn’t even begin to guess that your dependable, admired Onii-chan could shiver like a little kid scared of ghosts.</p><p>So when I saw you, I felt silly for getting cold feet.</p><p>Just to look strong, I acted the older brother, wiped my tears away… and stood in front of the camera imposingly.</p><p>I rejected makeup to the end since I was still scared, but other than that, I did the job perfectly.</p><p>Even now, every time I stand before a camera, I always think back to your gaze from back then, Yuu-kun.

Then that’s really not thanks to me… It just means you’re strong, and that you’re fit to be a model, Izumi-san.</p><p>When I was shaken, you would be there. And when you were about to cry, I would…</p><p>By supporting each other like that, we really shone before the camera back then.</p><p>The adults probably thought pairing us together was the right choice. After that, we got more work as a set, I think.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Those were happy times. Well, as a result, more work piled up, and the demands became increasingly difficult…</p><p>Yet, we were too young to cope with all of that.</p><p>We both had familial troubles happening then, and things got out of hand.</p><p>In the end, we couldn’t stay at that radiant place.

I think Eden’s going to highlight on their solidarity as a full team.</p><p>They’re planning to override us by using themselves what’s supposed to be Trickstar’s strength.</p><p>…If I put it that way, can you see?</p><p>It’s similar to the public execution <em>fine</em> showed us before DDD.</p><p>They want to show off the difference between our skills using the same rules, to make it known that they’re our betters.</p><p>That way, they can break our fighting spirit… our hearts.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Haha. No need to trace all the way back to DDD. It’s the same method Nagisa-san used towards me right before Autumn Live.</p><p>Even Summer Live’s the same, actually.</p><p>It’s such a classic~ Showing off the difference in levels to decide the match before it happens.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. Well, half of Eden were once part of <em>fine</em>; I think they’re similar in their methods.</p><p>But anyway, I think it’s going to be tough to fight on the same grounds.</p><p>Our opponent’s Eden, the guys said to be the strongest in our age group. In terms of pure total strength, we’ll be losing”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “If only Subaru and Hokuto are around~ We can fight like usual, treating it like a skirmish for SS.</p><p>We might seriously need to work up some kind of clever scheme for a giant killing, like our usual.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I’m not so sure about claiming ‘clever schemes’ and ‘ambushes’ as our usual, but…</p><p>Well, I guess to stand up against an enormous opponent, guerilla warfare is the best?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “…Makoto, you’re pretty calm. Hehe, let me guess: it’s all well within your expectations?</p><p>You’ve been so composed and contemplative in your actions these days; you feel seriously dependable~♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “That’s saying too much. I’m actually pretty anxious~ I did prepare for unlikely possibilities though,</p><p>so that when it comes to worst, we can avoid a game over here no matter what.</p><p>That’s why I called you instead of coming alone, Isara-kun.</p><p>If I were by myself, it would’ve been hopeless taking on the entire Eden however hard I struggle.</p><p>Yet if I had been certain things would turn out like this, I would’ve called Akehoshi-kun and Hidaka-kun too.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “But why me? I’d say I’m more in charge of keeping the balance, not having the talent nor skills to cause a tide in battle yet?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “It’s cool how you said ‘yet’, Isara-kun. There’s no serious reason; the others just seemed to have other plans, so I didn’t call them.</p><p>From what I heard of you, you seemed to be planning to nap until afternoon.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yep. I’ve been taking rests while forging myself in moderation. I’m accumulating my energy so I can release them all on the real deal.</p><p>It’s sooner than planned, but I think I’ll use part of that energy.</p><p>I think we can just barely make up for the absence of the other two by putting double the effort.</p><p>Actually, the vice prez trained me and taught me a little secret technique of him. I’ll try using it today.</p><p>Man, secret techniques sound like we’re in a shounen manga…♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eh, what? Will you shoot laser beams from your hands?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nah. You know how the vice prez’s Akatsuki focuses in traditional arts? He taught me the arts and frames of mind from them that are utilized to this day, is all.</p><p>Using the split-second transition from stillness to motion, like in kabuki and Noh plays…</p><p>I can do a complete transition from a resting state to a fully active mode, in a moment!</p><p>I conserve my energy so they won’t be needlessly spent, so they can be used for the right time.</p><p>When it’s time, I can release everything within the counts of seconds, and exert my ‘full power’ in its purest definition.</p><p>That’s the technique the vice president taught me.</p><p>It’s like a routine in sports, I’d say… Transitioning from everyday mode to emergency mode at the flick of a switch.</p><p>In my case, pulling up my hair and showing off my forehead… having my usual hairstyle on is my switch.</p><p>When I have my bangs down, I’m basically in my off mode, so this day onward when you see me like that, assume that I’m resting.</p><p>Vice president puts on his glasses and takes them off, opens and closes a door, recites a sutra, consciously blinks…</p><p>He juggles between these different switches, controlling his energy output with them.</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/KOtXiFR.jpg"></p><p>I’m not at that level yet; all I can do is a simple on and off, but…</p><p>I’ve had my rest today.

Anyway, I think it’s wrong to call out a white lie as a betrayal.</p><p>She needs to pretend that she’s properly resting in front of you guys, that’s why she said that.</p><p>In reality, Anzu was unused to PV shoots, and the other staffs on the scene were the ones getting most things done. It’s not like she’s working herself to the bones.</p><p>Take it as that she’s doing the minimum possible work to keep her senses sharp.</p><p>Just like how you’re joining the Basketball Club practice to keep your body fit right now.</p><p>Rolling around in bed isn’t the only thing that constitutes as resting.

That sort of pressure and lack of faith can most hurt the person you hold dear, you know.</p><p>If you’re friends and comrades, have more faith.

Stretch out your hand so you can walk together.</p><p>I once failed to stop Ryuuseitai from breaking apart.</p><p>I was scared of losing my place by criticizing others and getting into a clash, so I held my tongue and watched on as everything fell apart.</p><p>So I thought I shouldn’t let something similar ever happen again.</p><p>Like in Himitsu Sentai Gore*ger, after losing all my old comrades, I now walk together with the surviving kids I met due to a miracle.</p><p>If it’s you, you can do better than I did… or I guess that’s not a good way to phrase it.

Splendid, Akehoshi! I have nothing else to teach you… There, there♪</p><p>You, and Isara too… You both skillfully accomplish whatever you’re told to do. You guys are geniuses.</p><p>There are few high school students with your height who can dunk.</p><p>If you focus on basketball, you might even become a first-class athlete. Yet you want to be an idol, right?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yep. I do like basketball~ But becoming an idol has been my dream since I was a child.</p><p>I only started basketball after enrolling to high school, because Chii-chan-senpai invited me.</p><p>My passion for it isn’t enough yet, or more like, I don’t care enough to abandon becoming an idol in favor of it.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha. You grow rapidly, so as the Basketball Club captain, I can’t help being greedy and wanting to take on the championship.</p><p>But first of all, you need to take the throne as an idol. Only one in a million is granted the right to reach out for that seat.</p><p>I’d take your place if I could, but you have no choice but to do it. Do your best, Akehoshi, Trickstar… Make your dreams come true and come back.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Of course. Keep your eyes open and watch, Chii-chan-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I will! Don’t hesitate to call for me when you’re in trouble! I’ll tactlessly come to your rescue☆”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/00V5crG.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah. I believe you. You’ve always come to my rescue when I needed you, Chii-chan-senpai.</p><p>You’re dense and clueless, so I always thought it was weird.</p><p>But Chii-chan-senpai, you actually come to anyone’s rescue at all times, without asking questions, don’t you?</p><p>So it’s just your good luck that the person you’re trying to rescue is actually in trouble for some of those.</p><p>It’s a ‘fake it till you make it’ kind of thing~ You don’t bother thinking before you act, whether the person actually needed help from the heart.</p><p>So even when we’re totally doing fine here…</p><p>You say things like ‘Are you okay?’ ‘Should I help?’ ‘Cheer up!’ and that’s why people are annoyed.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fuhaha. Sometimes, being careful with the other person’s circumstances can make it too late to take actions.</p><p>If that means I might overlook someone in trouble, then I’d rather be treated like an annoyance.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Wow, cool. That’s why I like you, and think you’re a real hero, Chii-chan-senpai.</p><p>Thanks. For saving me when I was alone, loong ago. Even though there was nothing in it for you…</p><p>I was deeply moved, and happy, to know there was someone like you.</p><p>Thanks for calling out to me that day. For putting me in the Basketball Club, for inviting me to do club activities with you almost everyday…</p><p>Just by you doing that, I felt lighter.</p><p>I reached my happiness. I made the most out of my youth. I never got discouraged enough to run away, and now, I’ve even grasped the right to stand on a huge stage.</p><p>I’m grateful. It might be in a hero to not seek repayment, but let me say thank you, at least.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Eh, what’s wrong, Akehoshi? It’s like you’re leaving to become a bride… I’m lonely.</p><p>Are you becoming nervous, as it’s right before the unprecedented grand stage?</p><p>You don’t need to feel like you owe me. I just did the natural thing. As a first year, you looked really lonely, not having any friends.</p><p>I thought you were to be pitied, so I called out to you. That’s all there was to it, and you weren’t special.</p><p>I would’ve done the same to anyone other than you.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “This bastard… Ah well, it’s more comfortable that way.</p><p>Son of ‘that Akehoshi’, genius, main character, they say; there were more times I’ve been put on a pedestal, but…</p><p>The me who felt lonely for having no friends was still me, and Chii-chan-senpai saved that me.</p><p>So really, I’m just repeating myself, but… thanks.</p><p>I’ll definitely win. I’ll win with a laugh, and become happy.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Akehoshi~! It really sounds like you’re leaving to become someone’s bride! Dad is lonely!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Why lonely~? I’m telling you I’m gonna become happy so can’t you give your blessings?</p><p>Nah. You should be happy at your child’s growth, Dad.”</p><h3 id="14">/ 14</h3><p><strong>&gt; Theater Club room</strong></p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/GYNLcyM.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “……”</p><p>(…Phew. For a small box that appeared light, it was unexpectedly heavy.</p><p>I can’t be getting muscle strains before SS, so I probably should’ve borrowed a cart or something to help lift it.</p><p>Not that it’s any use to ponder now.</p><p>I should start stretching to avoid any muscle strain.)</p><p>“One, two, three…♪”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/nskoyJ9.jpg"></p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “&lt;One, Two, Amazing!&gt; Ahaha! For you to start doing radio calisthenics out of nowhere, with no forewarning! How exemplary as an entertainer to perform comedy when no one is watching…☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Who’s an entertainer? Well, idols are entertainers too, I guess…”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “Huuh? I took the trouble to erase my presence and jump down from a blind spot right above you, so are you not reacting too flatly?</p><p>What an unrewarding child to entertain…!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I don’t get surprised by whatever you do anymore.”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “In fact I’d like to ask, what should I do to surprise you <em>ever</em>, Hokuto-kun…?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…I never admitted it, but I’m relatively taken by surprise each time. It just doesn’t show on my face or gestures, or so it seems.</p><p>That’s why people think I’m constantly calm and composed.</p><p>You have good ears, so shouldn’t you be able to tell from my heart rate jumping up and such?”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “No no. Your reactions are still faint even with that.</p><p>You’re a thoroughbred of the entertainment world, I suppose. The classic methods can’t incite a reaction of surprise from a child born and raised in the land of dreams.</p><p>Perhaps the ‘normal’ is more of a surprise to you. Tomoya-kun, Anzu-san…</p><p>But that is a genre I’m bad at, so this is proving to be quite the harsh battle.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “And who are you supposed to be battling against? …Well, who cares; what’s your business? There’s no Theater Club activity today, is there?”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “No, actual club activities begin after the new year. Eichi says he’s building a new theater, so I plan for us to hold a play there.</p><p>We will not make it in time for the theater’s formal open house, unfortunately.</p><p>Scheduling something from now would distract you from SS, after all.</p><p>Because you’re clumsy to the core, Hokuto-kun. You do not know how to accomplish two things at a time.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It’s not like you to think of my circumstances. I wouldn’t care if you had scheduled something… Since we’re talking about a play at a new theater, I doubt there’s much slack in time, right?</p><p>I’ll start practicing the role if you give it to me now. I’m resting until SS and I don’t have much to do, so it’s better to have a distraction.”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “Hmm. In your case… you lack talent at a fundamental level, so nothing much would change by giving you time to practice, I think.</p><p>There isn’t much difference between you acting on impromptu, or after great amount of practice.</p><p>In fact, you’d start misunderstanding things in a mysterious way, wander a full circle, and end up with worse acting than you started with.</p><p>Honestly, you are the nightmare of every instructor.</p><p>On that point… Tomoya-kun absorbs what he’s taught like a sponge, so he is interesting to instruct.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Tell that to the kid. He hates you like poison because you only ever train him harshly, or toy with him.</p><p>Youths these days are raised with love and care, so they practically need to be praised for something as simple as breathing—</p><p>Or they’ll be frustrated, like they’re not getting what they should be naturally granted.</p><p>That’s what Grandma said. Plus, you don’t often come across someone who can go along with you and not desert you. Take good care of him… praise him so he’ll grow.”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “Fufufu. I doubt a toddler who doesn’t know how to walk without the promise of reward can act the part of a foreigner from a faraway land or a historical figure—</p><p>Becoming an actor who can embrace the life stories of venerable strangers.</p><p>But that is the sort of era we live, I suppose. Expecting tenacity is nonsense.</p><p>A democratic revolution leads the privileges the nobles once monopolized to be spread out to the mass.</p><p>As a result, everyone becomes the royal and noble. Kings are celebrated, esteemed, and served. We are clowns happily dancing to them.</p><p>If you cannot take delight in doing that, quit the play. Those who want to be treated like a prince or a princess have no need for mask.</p><p>In olden times, wearing a mask to conceal one’s true nature is the proof of a phantom. Something alien and unknown, but definitely not human, and thus worthy of persecution…</p><p>They are counterfeit of humanity; pitiful and laughable creatures abandoned by God.</p><p>I am already at the point of no return, but…</p><p>I don’t believe you two have to walk the thorny path on will.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You’re not the one who gets to decide that.</p><p>Maybe you’re trying to scold me with a story of your failure like a proper upperclassman, but it doesn’t strike a chord. The times have changed… buchou.</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/w4ungb0.jpg"></p><p>In these times, a mask is the proof of a hero.”</p><h3 id="15">/ 15</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Anyway, you came at the perfect time, buchou. Can you open this box?”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “Hmm? Oh, an antique safe! A Pandora’s box with unidentifiable amount of machineries!</p><p>I happen to enjoy solving <em>and</em> making these things♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I like puzzles too. It’s one of our few common grounds, I guess.</p><p>That aside. This box apparently has two compartments… but I can’t get to the second one no matter how hard I tried; it’s troubling me.”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “I see… It appears to have a complex and curious design, through combinations of countless gears, nesting, and various materials.</p><p>I dare say whoever created this was quite the monomaniac.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Who gives you the right to insult people’s father?”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “Eh, your father created this, Hokuto-kun?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That he did. He was an alumni of Yumenosaki, and he apparently hid this box in the academy grounds before he graduated.</p><p>It happened that I’m on a break and have a lot of time on hand, so I headed out to look for it from the morning.”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “Eehh! You were treasure hunting!</p><p>That sounds like a whole lot of <em>fun!</em> How could you not invite me, Hokuto-kun…!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “He told me where he hid it, so all I did was yank part of the floor in the secret underground archives and blandly dug at the earth.</p><p>It wasn’t something so fun as treasure hunting.</p><p>That got me needlessly spent… Looking back on it, I should’ve dramatized my story to pull your interest and make you do the labor for me.</p><p>By pretending it’s actually a treasure hunt and all that.”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “You are bad at using people, Hokuto-kun.</p><p>Maybe it’s because your childhood demanded you to act like you could accomplish anything, perfectly, on your own.</p><p>But you are not on your own anymore, are you?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I want to return the exact same words at you.”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “Fufufu. Anyway, this box seems quite difficult to solve… Please give me five minutes or so.</p><p>Just waiting might bore you, so you may play with this♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…? What? A mask?</p><p>Geh… Is this Hokke Mask’s mask?”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “Nostalgic, is it not? I found it while cleaning up for a new year!</p><p>It was with the Five Oddballs costume Shuu created long ago!</p><p>It was a prop from a role you played, so you should have it. Well, you can give it to me to add to my mask collection too~♪</p><p>But it is your mask, so it looks off when placed alongside my masks.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I should’ve thrown it away after standing on that stage with you… Did you retrieve and keep it, buchou?”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “Yes. I thought a different need might call for it in the future.</p><p>We used the club budget to get it made, so would it not be a waste to throw it away?</p><p>You are aware I was subjugated as part of the Five Oddballs back then.</p><p>Club members kept dropping, and we had an economic sanction in which our budget was cut.</p><p>I thought I should find use for every item on hand, so I retrieved it for recycling purposes.</p><p>Costumes, stage properties, stage sets… I have been using them with care for a while now.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I didn’t think you’d have a cheapskate mentality, buchou.”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “I have done my share of street performances~ I understand the gravity of a few coins.</p><p>While not vital for a human to live on, it is the natural mindset to be assumed by any who chooses to eat through doing art.</p><p>Don’t take youth and money for granted…♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Buchou. I’ve always meant to ask this, but why did you make me stand on the same stage as you that day?</p><p>Was I purely a stand-in to fill the blank, to comply to the rules of the unit system?</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/7aKEpO3.jpg"></p><p>At that time, you were thoroughly mangled as one of the Five Oddballs, and you were probably too driven to a corner to have the leisure to think…</p><p>So I wouldn’t question if you say there was no particular meaning.</p><p>But I can’t help thinking you had some sort of motive, when I look back to the days I’ve spent since then to this day.</p><p>In hindsight… now I have avenged you, who were killed as a villain that day. So was it for a revenge plot that you included me?</p><p>During those times, I was the closest person to you. Not the other Five Oddballs, and obviously not the student council president…</p><p>It was me, who spent every day training with you in the Theater Club.</p><p>I’m a person, I get attached to things and people I always have around. I even look up to you as an actor.</p><p>And then I had to watch you getting unreasonably vilified and crushed underfoot before my eyes.</p><p>Of course that sprouted a desire for vengeance within me. I was discontent, I couldn’t stand the unfairness of it; my heart was set aflame in wrath.</p><p>…I was so frustrated, buchou.</p><p>My anger from that time led me to the revolution we caused after. But my earliest motive was that: a childish grudge.</p><p>Revolutions and all that lofty spiels came following after.</p><p>You were the one who sowed the buds of that revolution.</p><p>And then you once again engineered yourself to be slain in DDD, directly assisting our revolution.</p><p>If you weren’t there, our revolution wouldn’t have succeeded… It wouldn’t even have started.</p><p>Why are you always like that? Why do you always long to be the monster slain by heroes? Why do you go out of your way to sacrifice yourself?”</p><h3 id="16">/ 16</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It’s like I’m dancing on top of your palm, as you want me to… it’s irritating.</p><p>If there’s something you want to be done, do it yourself like a normal person.</p><p>The vicissitudes of fate led the irrelevant third-rate phantom Hokke Mask to become a hero.</p><p>But you and your sacrifice will never get rewarded.</p><p>The spectators won’t ever notice. Even though you were at the beginning and the center of everything; the main character.</p><p>Even though you had the skills, charm, fate befitting of that role… Why?</p><p>Why do you retreat to the stage wing at the most important times?”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “That is overestimating me too much, and the main role isn’t the only role there is.</p><p>I love any role from the bottom of my heart, so I let the children who want to play the main role have it.</p><p>Though it may be arrogant to say I <em>let</em> them… But still, I like this position.</p><p>After all, to play the main role means I cannot witness the main role with these eyes, yes?</p><p>I want to fraternize with the main role. With a different individual in my position.</p><p>In this reality, I was born under odd stars that bestowed me with a great many talents and fates, often framing me into a main character-like presence… So at least, when on top of a stage.</p><p>After standing shoulder-to-shoulder with my equals as one of the Five Oddballs, that wish was granted to some extent.</p><p>So, well, I have nothing to regret about my last stage as one of the Five Oddballs.</p><p>My dream was already granted long ago. Thus, I had no reason to seek revenge. You are overthinking it, Hokuto-kun.</p><p>Only, you are a thoroughbred of the entertainment world… To be perfect and excellent is what’s expected of you, and you’ve worked hard to correspond to that expectation. But reality is cruel.</p><p>You are a person, so you can fail.</p><p>And as Hidaka Hokuto-kun is supposed to be a genius, born to two eminent people, your failures are more fatal to you than normal people.</p><p>When you betray the expectation of the masses, the insult, criticism, and malice directed at you may fester to no end.</p><p>I wanted you to earn the fortitude to bear all that.</p><p>Because you’ve stood by someone like me so far, for reasons I can’t begin to guess.</p><p>You should know what I am like; companionship with me does not tend to hold out for long.</p><p>Yet like it’s the most normal thing to do, even when you are appalled or fed up with me, you would still show up in the club room the next day.</p><p>That made me happy, you see.</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/QnNh0Uf.jpg"></p><p>Really. Perhaps far, far more than you can imagine.</p><p>For a long time, we spent idle everyday together. This is embarrassing to admit, but that was a first for me since I was born.</p><p>I do not know how to describe my relationship with you.</p><p>We are too distant to equate to friends or family, but not so business-like as to be framed as simply work partners.</p><p>A teacher and his pupil wouldn’t fit either, for I haven’t particularly taught you anything.</p><p>We are simply together before we knew it, and happen to be familiar enough to have a light exchange whenever we run into each other.</p><p>I tend to take anything to the extremity, so such thing was really a first for me. I was happy.</p><p>That is why—while not quite as an expression of thanks—I had you stand on that hellish stage in the finale.</p><p>On that fearsome stage, in which the audience, co-actors, and the rest of the world that wasn’t even present, were against me.</p><p>There, without knowing what I was truly like or what I felt, I was vilified and thrown stones and garbage at, simply because that’s the natural thing to do…</p><p>That stage was in itself the tortures of hell.</p><p>But even at such stage, the pitiful pierrot could smile contented… I wanted you to know that.</p><p>By showing you a glimpse of that hell, as my extra—</p><p>If the time comes that you have to endure the same torture, I was hoping you’d breeze through it without wavering.</p><p>You can be strangely sturdy, and an experience you’ve had once before rarely falters you the second time, right?</p><p>You are a poor learner with no talent, but you carry what you’ve learned through experience to your grave.</p><p>Slowly perhaps, but the data are recorded and built within you.</p><p>Thus I had you take part in a tragedy that does not happen often.</p><p>That’s all there is to it. Don’t try too hard to seek meaning and depth… Hokke Mask-kun.”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/myaceJk.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m Hidaka Hokuto.

I’m not running away anywhere, and I’ve had my mental preparation done and over with.</p><p>I was always the type who’s strong on the real deal since I was a kid anyway♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nah… I might get cold feet once they actually put the audience in front of me.</p><p>I can stay calm right now only because it hasn’t sunk on me yet.</p><p>Do you see all those people gathering who look like they’re here for SS, even though the opening ceremony hasn’t even started?</p><p>There’s going to be more of them as hours pass, right?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah yeah, it’s just <em>the best</em>! I wish the entire human race <em>all</em> over the world would come see us!</p><p>It’s a pity that’s physically difficult! Well, we’re available for national viewing through television broadcast, though!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “You’re amazing, Subaru… The grander the stage, the happier you get, huh?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Like you don’t feel the same~♪ Boy, it’s really looking to be the best day ever!”</p><h3 id="2-3">/ 2</h3><p>&gt; SS Dome Event Hall (Waiting room)</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/ABNyF.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Excuse us~☆</p><p>Oh, no one’s here! Isn’t this the waiting room for SS contenders?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Not ‘contenders’ nor ‘waiting room’. It’s the ‘dressing room’ for ‘participating idols’.</p><p>They’re giving a dressing room for each unit, so it’s natural there would be no one here.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I see~ That’s kinda troubling… Actually, Barry called me to talk, so I thought I could pick a random time to greet them and use that chance to have whatever talk it is he has.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Barry…?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “That’s Saegusa-kun, I think. Huh, he called you to talk? I have only bad feelings about that!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah. For some reason, he called to my home number in the morning~</p><p>I wonder how he knew that number. We’re kind of hiding it from the public, for reasons.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Nn. That boy’s ability to gather intel is far more than to be reckoned with… Just how much does he know, I wonder?</p><p>During the joint interview and the shopping mall live the other day, I did try to search him up a bit…</p><p>But he’s impenetrable. Too scary.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Making us think that way is likely part of the strategy. There’s nothing to gain by being overly-anxious, and it’s dangerous to overestimate the enemy.</p><p>But I’m curious about him calling Akehoshi to talk.</p><p>Right before DDD, the student council president also called us, and that became the happening that ran a crack between us.</p><p>It’s going to be tough to regain calm within today, if something equal or worse were to happen.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “We had a week to spare during DDD but not this time…</p><p>Hmm~ This is looking to grow into a real-time battle that demands quicker decision-making and reaction than that time.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha, but isn’t that our specialty~?♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I agree. But it doesn’t erase my worry. Let’s find out the enemy’s intent and deal with it quick.</p><p>In the case of anything happening, make sure to always be in contact. We’ll tackle all problems together as a group.</p><p>…Hmm. I see, so you’ll be in charge of correspondence to make sure we’re all on the same page, Anzu? That’s a help. Please watch over us today as always, our Goddess of Victory.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Megamin, Megamin, that’s great and everything but are we not getting new costumes this time?</p><p>I don’t see anything but the standard Tricktar unit outfits in the locker~?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t just take the goddess―<em>megami</em>―part and say it like a nickname. It sounds like you’re mocking me, I don’t like it.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nah, but don’t you think calling a close friend of the same age a ‘goddess’ sounds more like a funny joke?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Don’t do that, Subaru. Hokuto is <em>serious</em>… He’s a guy who can say stuff like that with a straight face… That’s his virtue…”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. Anzu-chan has learned to brush it off by playfully replying with ‘<em>Yes, Goddess here~</em>’ anyway…</p><p>He’s called her that repeatedly time and time again, so it is practically a nickname.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmph… Well, I wasn’t exactly saying it to make her heart race, so that’s fine…</p><p>But it’s a little lonely when she brushes me off like that.</p><p>Anyway, back to topic. There’s no way Anzu wouldn’t prepare a new costume for SS.</p><p>We’re talking about someone who does needlework even when hospitalized.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Whoa, Anzu looks really down! Hey Hokke, that one just now sounds like sarcasm!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Right. I’m aware I shouldn’t keep rubbing it in. Humans make mistakes. So we should acknowledge that and reflect so we can advance together.</p><p>No―we <em>have</em> been advancing by doing that, which brought us where we stand now.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah, we’ve hit walls and lost our way…</p><p>But we kept going without breaking down, and that’s how we’ve arrived at today, participating in SS, the stage of longing for all idols.</p><p>Fufu. I feel like I can finally say from the bottom of my heart, that I’m an idol.</p><p>I’ve always been bothered… by ‘Yuuki Makoto, the model’ sitting in a small corner of my heart.</p><p>I felt somewhere, that I was lying to myself and only pretending to be an idol.</p><p>But now, I think even the me in that small corner is saying with a smile: ‘I’m an idol!’</p><p>Ehehe. I managed to become an idol like all of you, huh?</p><p>I’m so happy. It’s such an honor and I’m so proud; I want to commend myself.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Geez, don’t start acting like everything’s over and all’s left is to sleep, guys.</p><p>It’s just gonna start from now. Let’s restore our spirits and give it our all~♪</p><p>It’s seriously looking to be a severe battle where even a moment of inalert will be fatal.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eden isn’t our only opponent too~ Those amazing idols we fought during our ‘pilgrimage’ are also participating.</p><p>Professionals and amateurs alike, many of the best idols there are will be standing our way.</p><p>It’s gonna be next to impossible to do all of them in and win.</p><p>But if I can do that… I feel like Dad might finally smile. You know, I still can’t forget Dad’s face that I saw for the last time.</p><p>He looked purposeless and empty. That was the first and last I’ve ever seen that look on him…</p><p>I think, I became an idol because I wanted to change that to a smile.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, let’s put a smile on the face of everyone in the world. For that, we need to start by having fun and smiling ourselves.</p><p>Ultimately, it isn’t a problem of winning or losing.</p><p>Though <em>of course</em> I have all the intent to win. But the one who gets to have the most fun and spread the most fun is probably the one to take the trophy.”</p><h3 id="3-2">/ 3</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Hmm? What’s wrong, Anzu?</p><p>You seem restless. If you need the toilet, you should hurry before the opening ceremony starts. We won’t have much time to slow down after that.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, it’s almost nostalgic, hearing your lack of tact towards the other sex, Hidaka-kun…</p><p>Back when Anzu-chan just transferred, I think you often made the mistake of repeating such tactlessness.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmph, I was and <em>am</em> trying to be considerate, actually… It’s difficult; I just can’t get used to it.</p><p>I’m sorry for not acting like the prince of girls’ dreams, Anzu.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha, well, it isn’t bad to have a prince like that, no?</p><p>One that’s not too snobbish. We’re at an era where what’s accessible to the common people is what’s more widely acceptable, anyway.</p><p>Rather than that, I think Anzu wants us to change into our Trickstar outfits.</p><p>Look, she’s fidgeting while holding the outfits.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm, hmm… I understand now, Anzu. So you want us to wear the usual outfits for the opening ceremony and the preliminaries.</p><p>You made new costumes, but you’re planning to reveal them on the real stage?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. So, if we lose at the prelims, those new outfits will go to waste?</p><p>Now I absolutely can’t lose! I can’t not wear your new costume, Anzu!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Uh-huh… So the new costumes win at impact, but for preliminaries, you think it’s better to wear the usual outfits that the audience are likely more familiar with?</p><p>Yeah, I think that’s the right tactic.</p><p>We went on like a ‘pilgrimage’ over the country, and did our share of advertisements on TV and the internet, even if it’s a humble attempt compared to Eden’s.</p><p>For most of those times, we were wearing the usual unit outfits. Fans who think those outfits symbolize Trickstar are likely not few.</p><p>SS garners a large crowd of audience from outside…</p><p>I agree that it’s better to wear an outfit that more people know.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “True. I think we’ve all seen how unknown we were at national level…</p><p>Even if we appear with new costumes here, they might just go like ‘<em>Who are these guys even?</em>’</p><p>A fast ball is only effective when you’ve had a fair number of straightforward games.</p><p>If we do something that stands out without going through the steps, they’ll likely just ignore us.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Okay~ So dressing up is <em>after</em> we win the preliminaries; Roger! I’ll do my best so I can wear that new outfit Anzu made.</p><p>Watch. We’re gonna win this, Anzu.</p><p>…H-Huh? Anzu~? Why are you averting your eyes and backtracking? I said watch me!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Akehoshi. Don’t start changing in front of Anzu like it’s the most natural thing. Instead of me, <em>you’re</em> the one lacking any sort of tact towards the other sex here.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah. Sorry, sorry.</p><p>Hmm~… Next year the Producer Course will commence for real, and girls will start enrolling, so I should learn.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “<em>Speak of next year and demons will laugh</em>, ever heard of this saying? Let’s overcome SS first of all so we can greet the end of the year with satisfaction.</p><p>Ah~… If I don’t keep encouraging myself like that, I feel I might get a fright.</p><p>I think I’ll go crazy from nervousness, actually… I wish it’ll just start quick. For real.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It’s starting as we speak. There’s no time for leisure until the opening ceremony. Start getting changed.</p><p>…I’m sorry, but I need you to exit the room for a bit, Anzu.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nn~ But isn’t it cold out on the corridor since the heaters barely work? Anzu, you can stay in the room, so…</p><p>Use my eyemask; I’ll lend it to you. We’ll tell you when we’re done.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. It’s starting to get hectic, just like we always are, I guess…♪”</p><p>&gt; SS Dome Event Hall (Lobby)</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Umm… The venue for the opening ceremony is this way, right? It’s so wide here in the SS dome that I might get lost!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Then how about you don’t go running ahead, and quietly follow behind Anzu who actually has the map of the area remembered? Why do you always try to run ahead by yourself anyway?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Well, you see~ It’s because I trust you guys are following after me☆”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. But seriously, it’s crowded, so you shouldn’t be running, Akehoshi-kun.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “This is close to the reception area, after all. There’s a really long line~…</p><p>We’re supposedly not open to regular audience yet, but there’s a lot of people already.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. The people we see gathering here right now are celebs, everyone else in the business, and powerful figures of the country, I believe.</p><p>They’re the VIP guests, in other words… True to its nature as an industry-scale event, SS gathers some really famous faces.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah, TV personalities I’ve seen before, left and right… Ah, isn’t that Hokke’s Papa and Mama over there? Hokke, how about you greet them?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, I’ll do that later. There’s a crowd gathering around them, and yesterday… I spent the whole day with my parents, so I’ve run out of things to say.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “But there are media crews too?</p><p>Why don’t you show off in front of the camera that you’re the son of a popular idol and a huge actress, and get the VIP people to remember your face and name?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… But isn’t that conversely improper?</p><p>Autumn Live especially got me to realize that it’s natural to utilize anything worth using, including one’s parents, but…</p><p>I think my parents would stubbornly advertise me without me asking anyway.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hokke’s parents are a surprisingly doting pair, after all♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmph… I hate how they put up an act of treasuring their son at important moments as if to make me owe them, when usually they barely care.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Rebellious phase? …I guess we really are still brats, huh.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Oh look, that’s Saegusa-kun.

Don’t we need to greet Trickstar?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “No. We are engineering the situation so all attention will be on Eden. If we interact with them, that attention will also fall on them.</p><p>It won’t be good if people think we’re rivals, marketing-wise.”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/cYxdclN.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Petty, aren’t we~ I don’t really like stuff like that.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Well, I bet it’s what’s needed. We all agreed to leave the strategies to Ibara, so we should do as he says today.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Right, right. It pains my heart to ignore those children though, just a little.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “H-Huh? Eden left!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “They just blatantly ignored us… It sorta hurts how it’s like we’re not even in their line of sight, when we look to them as our biggest rival.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I think they made the right choice, though~ Marketing-wise, and directing-wise, they don’t benefit from interacting with us.</p><p>Even with that shopping mall live, the news made it to the internet, but…</p><p>In the end, they only broadcast an abridged cut on TV.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “And even in news sites, we got cheap treatment, huh.</p><p>To the point that the helpers’―Ritsu and Sena-senpai’s―existences were totally written out.</p><p>What a shame. We put up a pretty good fight, though part of it is thanks to those two.</p><p>But it’s all treated like it never happened~ I guess that’s a given, if we think from the enemy’s side.</p><p>We could possibly be crushed at worst-case scenario back there―so it’s the closest thing to the best conclusion we could’ve had, I guess.</p><p>Even if the media didn’t properly report it… I’m sure there were people who turned into our fans among the audience at the scene.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup. We have Izumi-san and Ritsu-kun to thank. I think that was a real danger we were in back then, so they were huge help for being able to perform with us on improv.</p><p>But still. Despite those two from Knights helping us…</p><p>From an impartial standpoint, it ended with us ‘just barely alive’.</p><p>And I think Eden didn’t release even half of their true strength on that stage.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “And they don’t slack on cunnings on top of that strength. What a difficult opponent~ if only they’ll let their guard down a bit from their arrogance as the strongest unit.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… I suppose Eden is being thorough in making sure they’re not doing anything that would benefit us.</p><p>They were still scheming to swallow us in, back during Autumn Live.</p><p>Hence, they curried favors and threw baits at us that time… but I suppose this means they plan to have a serious match in SS.</p><p>Do what the enemy hates, without making anything go their way; that’s the principle of a war.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. Then if they’re so dead-set on ignoring us…</p><p>How about intruding in front of the camera while addressing them like besties? I bet they’ll hate that♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No, that might be a bad idea. They have more experience and advantage with television and media exposure in particular.</p><p>Look, most of the TV crews gathered here seem to be linked to the affiliation group CosPro belongs to.</p><p>If we pull something without a plan, they might do a crafty edit the moment they captured us on camera…</p><p>…and make us out into the bad guys. Into some unknown group persistently trying to get into a dispute with them, for one.</p><p>I’m not just saying this because I have a trauma regarding camera――</p><p>But really, those camera lenses are fearsome things. Live images can be distorted through edits and fabrications according to the enmity of another.</p><p>I think we should be careful while we’re in front of media crews under CosPro.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. However, we idols and the audience are not always separated by a screen.</p><p>We can come in contact with each other in this real life. And this time, with more people than ever had before…</p><p>So let’s make them all into our fans. That way, no matter how we were to be exaggerated and fabricated out of someone’s spite…</p><p>Our shine will reach everyone without diminish.</p><p>At least there’s no choice but to have faith and present every single audience before our eyes with songs and smiles, through dedication.</p><p>Don’t we all know since the start that it won’t be an easy fight, guys?</p><p>We’re going to do our best. No matter how hard a trial, even if the chance of victory is unbelievably slight―we can make a miracle happen, however many times.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yep; effort, friendship, victory.

In the opening ceremony, we only have to listen to speeches, so there’s nothing to be nervous for.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “R-Right. But they sure have it nice~ Eden will perform a song in the opening ceremony, won’t they? Look, it’s written in the program.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “They get to appeal to the audience first of all and flashily at that, yeah.</p><p>Opening a gap even before the fight… Well, that’s within expectations, though.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. Have you noticed, guys?</p><p>They’ve been playing Eden’s song at a low volume here… as if beating their singing voices into our eardrums and brains.</p><p>Eden really is using every trick. We need to appeal ourselves soon too, or we’ll just get swallowed and done in.</p><p>…I’d rather not depend on <em>that</em>, but the student council president is making his moves too, right?</p><p>It’s gotten me worried that I’ve only seen the effects of Eden’s strategies.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yeah, I heard he’s doing stuffs. All units of Yumenosaki are supposed to assist us, with the prez at the lead.</p><p>We won’t just let our opponents walk all over us.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Once you’ve got him as an ally, Eichi-senpai’s reliable, isn’t he~?</p><p>But nothing can happen if we as the real representatives make a shameful show of ourselves here, so let’s work to not waste their power of friendship!</p><p>Ah geez, I’ve gotten excited!

You wish you had seen the ceremony too, Anzu? You could, right? Being a producer and all.</p><p>Huh, you had errands to do while they’re holding the opening ceremony? Thanks; our opponent is a powerful production agency, but… there’s nothing to fear when you’re on our side, Anzu.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. Going on lavishing each other with praises won’t get us anywhere, and it’s not the time to relax.

Take the helm as always, Leader☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “All right. First, let us rehash the workings of the SS preliminaries in summary. They explained the rules during the opening ceremony, but there’s no loss in confirming them once again.</p><p>If we don’t make sure that we’re seeing eye to eye, we might end up taking different actions when problem emerges.</p><p>We are of one flesh as a unit, but we’re also separate individuals with our own ego.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. Rather than talking of individual ego and such, I wouldn’t mind if you do as you see fit, Hokuto.</p><p>You’re the leader, so use us like your own limbs.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. But if this is the method Hidaka-kun prefers, then shouldn’t we match him? I think he’s right that we should make sure we’re all working towards the same thing before the match starts.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh~ but I wanna start singing here and right now! I can’t control myself!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Geez, just shut up and listen. Anyway, as you all know, SS is the biggest idol festival in the country.</p><p>Plus, since idol culture is yet to be that popular outside the country, it might even be the biggest in the world.</p><p>This is from before we were born, but there used to be a national music program broadcast annually at the closing of the year, which got discontinued due to many reasons…</p><p>And formulated to succeed it was SS.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, we learned that in class. Apparently, the troubles from those times last to this day, influencing many parties and forcing them to change, right?</p><p>Like, Yumenosaki Academy was supposedly built to raise young male idols to be sent out for SS.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. I can’t go into details as it might turn into history class, but the content of SS slowly changes the more times it is held.</p><p>At first, like that national music program from the past…</p><p>Famous idols and artists were split into two camps, who then competed with each other.</p><p>It was a group battle, not an individual one. There was of course a winner between the camps, but the victor in terms of who’s chosen as the most excellent idol was vague.</p><p>But then matching the taste of the mass, who sought greater stimulation, and certain events bringing a fierce air within the entertainment industry…</p><p>The content changed that it became a contest to see who the most excellent idol of Japan is.</p><p>That brings us to present SS.</p><p>Even then, I’m just speaking of how SS has been until last year, as seeing Eden’s actions in the opening ceremony this year…</p><p>I think SS will likely find huge transformation once more.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah… Come to think of it, during the opening ceremony, Eden didn’t call this event SS, but Winter Live.</p><p>It’s like they’re trying to get the media to call it that as well.</p><p>Searching up social medias hit up quite a lot of results of people using the term Winter Live too…”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Huh. Summer Live, Autumn Live, and then Winter Live, huh…</p><p>SS is definitely more familiar to us.</p><p>And it’s easier to understand when you remember SS as the highest among the DreamFest ranks, above S1.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “We Yumenosaki kids might feel that way, but outsiders don’t know that.</p><p>On the other hand, CosPro held huge live performances across the country under the name Summer Live and Autumn Live.</p><p>After all of that, wouldn’t it conclude better when you call this Winter Live?”</p><h3 id="6-2">/ 6</h3><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hnn? But Summer Live was small-scale, wasn’t it~?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “CosPro matched the timing to send its idols to various events across the country during that period.</p><p>All of that are referred to as one Summer Live.</p><p>By calling SS Winter Live, they’re trying to make SS adhere to their game, I think.</p><p>Maybe by changing its name and dyeing it in their color, they mean to take it over?</p><p>The largest event in the idol industry, which Yumenosaki Academy has organized and raised to its current fame――</p><p>I’m sensing their intention to pluck it from the root and snatch it away.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “True. I heard CosPro plunders some Yumenosaki idols too.</p><p>It seems to be their specialty to snatch away what people have worked hard raising.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Well, CosPro hasn’t been around for long, so they probably have a hard time raising useful human resources…</p><p>So there’s no choice but steal for the meantime, right? It’s the basic in strategy wargames.</p><p>If we leave them be…</p><p>No, if Eden attains an undebatable and spectacular victory at the end of this, the whole industry will be swallowed into their wave.</p><p>The idol business will be dyed in a new color… and we’re supposed to be the ones specializing at revolution here.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I don’t think that’s a revolution~ That’s just invasion. We can’t let them get away with it easy.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nn~ But I think it’s not enough to just put up a struggle when attacked; we need to plan for what’s beyond too. Not that we have the leisure for that, now.</p><p>Let our guard down and we’ll be kicked out of the battlefield senseless.</p><p>We’re the only ones who can fight in SS as we’re the chosen representatives, so let’s all be prudent and take careful actions.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. Prudency is certainly needed. Yet, there’s no need to get fright and turn avoidant.</p><p>Compared to the DreamFests held almost daily in Yumenosaki, the rules of SS are kinder… looser is the word, I think.</p><p>It’s almost like DDD.</p><p>DDD was an event to choose the representatives of SS, but it probably was meant to be an exercise for SS too.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “It <em>was</em> Eichi-senpai’s idea~ So it’s a given that it would have multiple meanings.</p><p>If it’s the same as DDD, then is it a tournament where you’re finished if you lose?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Close. As participants of SS, we first have to pick our opponent and the place.</p><p>Or to be more specific… the one to pick will be our producer, Anzu.</p><p>Using the special device given at the start of SS, Anzu will get in touch with other idol producers, and work out the specifications of the match.</p><p>We can wage a match and vice versa.</p><p>But it’s not compulsory to accept. If you don’t feel like it, or think it won’t be beneficial to your strategy, you’re free to turn challengers down.</p><p>When a match is agreed to though, the SS staffs will direct us to a stage, and they’ll take us there with the crew vehicle.</p><p>We can suggest a location ourselves, but it’s more likely for them to decide it, by considering which stage will be most suitable.</p><p>Since the area for SS preliminaries spans almost the entire town, there’s high possibility we’ll be transported back and forth.</p><p>And if we don’t plan well, we might waste most of the allotted time on changing locations.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “So that’s going to the depend on our luck with the staffs.</p><p>Since Yumenosaki is the organizer of SS, if the staffs are the same, they might let us have the advantage.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, the SS Staff Association should be made of people of authority within the industry.</p><p>Although yes, the student council president is included, representing Yumenosaki.</p><p>Also, my parents. They might side with us, but in percentage more people there have been influenced in some way by CosPro.</p><p>Since we’re talking about the student council president here, he might use his wiles to make things easier for us, but…</p><p>He has a status to keep, so I doubt he can really have his way.</p><p>It’s better that we don’t expect to gain an advantage just because SS is a Yumenosaki event. Well, not that I ever expected it, to be honest.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Okay… But I’m glad. I’ve been a little concerned with this since I heard professionals participate in SS, but Hokke Papa doesn’t take part, huh?</p><p>He’s added to the staff association, after all. I like your Papa, so I prefer to not fight with him.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Heh, I would love to prevail over my father in a fair fight, on the other hand.</p><p>But SS is essentially a festival for young idols. You don’t really see those big-names… not that there’s zero, yeah.</p><p>Anyway. Once the opponent and the location is decided, we move. Then we perform a live battle to decide the winner and loser.</p><p>Live battle is just like the normal DreamFests we’ve become so familiar with.</p><p>Meaning, the audience will be the ones to score us with their lightsticks.</p><p>We and our opponent get to sing a song each, and the one with the higher score wins.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Just a song~? Then one battle will end in a flash, huh…?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. Idols participating in SS are many, after all.</p><p>If each battle takes time, then it may not end within today. That’s just how it is.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nn~ Then in the worst case, you might get to sing only a song before you’re dropped out from SS?</p><p>Even though you’ve put so much effort throughout the year just for this one day…?”</p><h3 id="7-2">/ 7</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, you don’t get to just go home after you lose. This is where SS differs from DDD.</p><p>The participants of SS are first-class idols; it’s a waste to send them home after singing just one song.</p><p>There’s the danger of their fans retiring along them.</p><p>So it’s not exactly a survival game common to Yumenosaki where you basically die if you lose.</p><p>We do a live battle, and the loser joins the winner’s camp.</p><p>Each of us SS idol participants is given something of a ‘national flag’―when we win, we get to take away our opponent’s flag.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah! You mean this flag? Wee… Look guys, the Trickstar logo is so cool☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s an important item so don’t treat it roughly… Anyway, so basically SS is about snatching flags.</p><p>You can snatch your opponent’s flag away when you win. Then the loser is given a flag of the winner’s and act as the winner’s vassal.</p><p>The vassal can still do live battles after that, snatching away their opponent’s flag when they win…</p><p>And give the flag they’re holding… the flag of their master’s to the opponent they won against.</p><p>So if all goes well, you won’t have to move much because the idols who became your vassals can win in your place and spread your reign.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “That’s the plan to take if we’re seeking the safest bet… It all ends when we lose, so we should take care in accepting a match.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh~? It’s boring to just wait! I wanna sing a bunch!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I know, I feel the same. But if you go against an opponent who already has many wins and vassals under their sleeves, you can gain all of that when you win.</p><p>So it is possible to do a turnabout at the final stages of the preliminaries if you’re smart about it.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “It really <em>is</em> like a strategy wargame… Conquer the lands around you and spread your domain; aim for unification of all the lands under your reign!-kind of thing.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. But well, even if their favorite idol loses and becomes a vassal, of course the fans will still support them, so…</p><p>The more vassals you have = the more fans supporting you.</p><p>That’s why just waiting in hope of a turnabout at the final stages might be hard.</p><p>We’ll see difficulties later if we don’t start strengthening our army manually by waging live battles and taking vassals in.</p><p>We’ll just find ourselves stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>That said, you can’t take back your flag after you lose, and there’s no room for cheating as they firmly keep track of match results.</p><p>Each battle that happens across the venue will decrease the number of standing powers.</p><p>Once the number of powers fall to eight―to eight idol groups, the preliminaries end.</p><p>Those eight groups are the ones to compete in the SS final stage.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Uh-huh… I see~ Nice rules they got there. It’s kinda like child’s play―chain tag, is it?</p><p>If, instead of being sent home, the idols still get to stand on stage as someone’s vassal after they lose――</p><p>Then a situation where the fans retire along their favorite idols can be avoided, too.</p><p>Our mission remains the same, then. Fight and win and repeat.</p><p>Of course strategies are still important, and we need to think about that too, but…</p><p>First, nothing will happen if we don’t give our all in each of the performance in front of us.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yup, that’s always the correct answer as an idol!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. Well, there’s no helping crafting strategies when nothing has started~ Let’s play it by ear for now while watching how things develop. Where should we start?</p><p>From the looks of it, we can do a live battle at Yumenosaki Academy’s premises―like the auditorium.</p><p>We have a lot of fans and acquaintances there, so I think we can expect a lot of votes.</p><p>Since we can suggest the location of the match… it might be better to suggest locations as close to Yumenosaki as possible.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Hmm~ well, it is our homebase.</p><p>But for our opponent-to-be, it would be an enemy territory where they have little chance of gaining satisfactory amount of votes…</p><p>So I bet few would accept to a match against us at such places.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right. Anyone would prefer to battle at a location advantageous to them.</p><p>While losing doesn’t kick you out completely, if you’re aiming to win SS, not a single loss is allowed.</p><p>Once you’re a vassal, you’re stuck with being a follower to the end.</p><p>And most likely, there isn’t a single person here who doesn’t care to win SS.</p><p>It’s the biggest idol festival in all of Japan. You’re practically promised a glorious future when you win.</p><p>We’re all desperate for that trophy.</p><p>That’s exactly why, I think, that at this beginning stage all participants will focus on watching how things develop as to avoid losing―leaving the situation stagnant because no one makes a move.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “But if you’re too scared of losing to move, you’re really going to hit a wall eventually… Hmm~… This is a tough decision.

Isn’t it embarrassing when people assume you turned into a villain due to your tragic upbringing?</p><p>My upbringing, and of course genes have nothing to do with it.</p><p>I <em>chose</em> to become a villain.

No one here is whimsical enough to go out of their way to fight somewhere disadvantageous to them.</p><p>We need to be the one making the resolve to go out there to fight.</p><p>Thankfully we’ve pulled through with narrow victories, but… with the unending series of harsh battles, I’m feeling exhausted.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “I still have some slack~ I’ve been diligent with my on/off switch and resting when I must, after all.</p><p>Rather than stamina, I’m starting to find limit in my skills, so I’m feeling sorry for that.</p><p>I thought I’ve squeezed every drop of blood for my training, since Autumn Live,</p><p>but compared to other idols in SS, I’m the only one who seem to fall somewhere below average.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s not true. Sure, your singing and dancing skills might leave a little more to be desired, Isara; but your resourcefulness and charisma more than make up for that.</p><p>The elaborate care you show while on the move and atop the stage, the way you interact with the audience…</p><p>Those things you do so offhandedly show such great polish and charm.</p><p>I’ve always envied that part of you, Isara. I respect you.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha, what’s that? Don’t praise me with such a straight face… you’re making me blush~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I always frankly speak out what I feel, without pretense.</p><p>But anyway, if we’re comparing skills, it’s not just you who’s still inexperienced, Isara; we Trickstar are.</p><p>However, by becoming one, just in the course of SS we’ve been growing, advancing, and adapting at rapid speed.</p><p>Have you noticed that the scores we gain on stage are growing larger and larger?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Aah… yup, that’s actually reflected in the data.</p><p>When we win, we get to make the opponent we defeated as our vassal,</p><p>and even after they become vassal, the fans tend to support the camp their favorite belongs to, which automatically increases our support and score, but…</p><p>That’s not just it. The score each fan gives is slowly becoming higher.</p><p>It means we haven’t turned reckless due to exhaustion; in fact, we’re getting better and better.</p><p>Ehehe, that’s just like Trickstar, right! The harsher the adversary, the stronger we get~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Oh… you’ve turned energetic, Yuuki. Had enough rest, I suppose?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Right. But can I buy a hot cocoa from this vending machine before we get a move?</p><p>SS isn’t just exhausting to the body but also the brain, so I want more sugar intake.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Sure, I think I’ll also buy something warm for myself. Being outside for long is freezing me to the core.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Huh? What’s wrong, Akehoshi? You’ve been quiet, come to think of it.</p><p>It’s not like you, are you tired? If you are, I can push the pressure point for erasing fatigue―Grandma taught me♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah! Dodge, Akehoshi-kun! Hidaka-kun’s acupressure seriously hurts! Deadly as a killing move…!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “He’s learned some unfortunate tricks, huh… Plus, Hokuto’s the type to cheaply use what he just learned for his own amusement… Well, acupressure is still within fine lines, though.</p><p>In SS, if you use a technique even once, the information will spread in no time and everyone will plan against you. So warm up your secrets and keep them hidden until the real stage.</p><p>Isn’t it a shounen manga cliche to overturn a pinch situation with a secret technique at the very last moment?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Mmn. But we’re out if we lose even once, so I can’t afford to be stingy.</p><p>We’ve survived so far only because we’ve continued to spend our all and bring our strengths past our limits.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Akehoshi? Seriously, what’s wrong? You’ve been unresponsive.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, sorry…</p><p>Anyway, shouldn’t you leave things like massage and drinks to the producer? Don’t take Anzu’s job away~”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Anzu is busy too. She’s a producer, not a manager.</p><p>I don’t think we should make her do everything. We have to take care of ourselves on our own, at least.”</p><h3 id="12-2">/ 12</h3><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu, Anzu-chan’s modestly doing a great deal, isn’t she?</p><p>She’s the one who’s been arranging for other Yumenosaki students to back us, at the exact same time she decides our next opponent, right?</p><p>She calls over Yumenosaki students and fans to support us, leads the way…</p><p>…so that by the time we arrive at the stage of the battle, they’re all already on stand-by.</p><p>Because SS prelims are held across this entire town, it’s too late to make a move only <em>after</em> a match is decided.</p><p>That’s why she took action as soon as she saw the chance, and made arrangements that would give us even the slightest advantage.</p><p>Isn’t that just so cool? Anzu-chan’s just like a real producer…♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “And what did you think she was all this time? …By the way, our fellow Yumenosaki idols who aren’t participating in SS are also doing many things over the city, huh?</p><p>They’re doing mini-lives and advertisements to support us Trickstar, in ways that don’t defy the rules of SS.</p><p>Even Knights and Akatsuki who were once our rivals and enemies…</p><p>They’re doing their best even though they’re not getting captured on TV; even though it doesn’t benefit them directly.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup. We can’t thank them enough, honestly… Not being able to fight within the premises of Yumenosaki was a handicap, but their support makes up for that. This whole town has become our homebase.</p><p>Thanks to all of that, we’ve had a relatively smooth sailing. I would even say we’re unstoppable!</p><p>Last year, we were nobodies――</p><p>But now, we’re fighting against strong, national-level opponents head-on. I can’t believe it; what if this all turns out to be a dream?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Don’t worry. I can assure you it’s not a dream. But if you’re satisfied here and throw all effort away, this moment here might evaporate like foam.</p><p>So that we can look back to SS as a good memory in the distant future, after we’ve become old men…</p><p>We’ve gotta set our souls aflame just a little longer, yeah?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup! It’s starting to get real fun, too~ The harder a game, the more fun it gets!</p><p>Plus, we’re fulfilling the promises we made to those idols we fought against during our ‘pilgrimage’ over the country―that is, to battle once more.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yeah, we were happy to see how far each other has grown, didn’t we――</p><p>Nah. We felt strong to know we have so many comrade-in-arms pursuing the same dream across Japan, didn’t we?</p><p>Oh man, being an idol is so fun~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu, I was afraid that you guys would start begging for a break, but… seeing you two, I guess that’s unneeded fear.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. Well, it’s probably the adrenaline making us forget our exhaustion, so watch out for your limits still, guys.</p><p>Don’t slack on self-care. Let’s all stand on the real stage at our best condition.</p><p>We probably only need one or two more victories to advance to the finals, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, I believe so. According to the rule, prelims is over when the remaining groups are eight, and…</p><p>From what I see, there are about 18 groups right now.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Huh. There were around 300 when we started, so the number’s been greatly reduced, eh?</p><p>It’s not really obvious though, since all of them stick around as vassals and continue to sing among us even after they lose.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Wow… It’s like we predicted but, it seems Eden is currently the top contender.</p><p>The amount of vassals they have is unbelievable. The flags we’ve stolen don’t compare.</p><p>Their vassals help spread the reign at rapid speed, flattening all other idols to the ground.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. The opponents we’ve fought against were all idols working at places unrelated to CosPro, after all.</p><p>They’re the opponents we’ve fought or costarred with once during our ‘pilgrimage’.</p><p>They were impressively charming, dignified… I feel lucky to compete against them.</p><p>Thanks to us winning fairly without hard feelings, their fans follow along them to support us too.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah. They were cheering us with varying dialects; the audience seat was practically chaos.</p><p>…We’ve managed to avoid fighting against CosPro idols so far. Good going~ just like in Anzu-chan’s plan.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm, but why do we have to avoid CosPro idols?</p><p>SS is a national broadcast. I don’t think they’ll be so crude as to dirty their hands under the watch of so many?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No, you see… Seeing the rules, we won’t benefit from fighting against CosPro idols in the prelims.</p><p>Even if we manage to turn one into our vassal, they’ll just lose on purpose to Eden or some other to switch side, which leaves us back where we started. Giving our all to fight them is a waste of stamina.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hm. I see. So to oppose CosPro, we need to keep challenging idols not influenced by them.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup. Some CosPro idols periodically wage a battle against us like an obvious assassination plot, but… Anzu-chan’s been doing a splendid job of rejecting them all.</p><p>There’s no point in fighting them, after all.</p><p>Of course, since we’ll gain experience, it’s not <em>absolutely</em> without merit, but…</p><p>What we need right now is victory―lots of it. Vassals who would really side with us.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. Before SS begun, I thought it’s gonna be a continuous clash against CosPro idols, but in truth, we can only opt to avoid them, huh…”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. No worries; we’re gonna clash against them on the finals, like it or not♪</p><p>For that, let’s just give it our all to what’s in front of us.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “…Subaru? Are you okay? You haven’t said a single word for a while now.</p><p>If the exhaustion really got to you, you can take it easy on the next stage and leave the hard work to us.</p><p>You’re a genius, so it might look as if you’ve got infinite amount of energy at your disposal, but I know…</p><p>That you really don’t. I’ve been in the Basketball Club with you all this time.</p><p>Depending on the situation, I know how frail you can be.</p><p>After being friends for so long, I won’t say I’m disillusioned or disappointed in you. Actually, I’m happy knowing that you’re as much of a human being as I am.</p><p>So don’t take it too far, yeah? Say a word when it gets tough.</p><p>Hey, we can hold our grounds without you if it’s just for a little bit. Depend on your teammates when you’re having a hard time.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah… Thanks, Sally.</p><p>I’m okay. It’s just, I’ve got this bad feeling… Sometimes, people in the audience and some passers-by had these eyes and air about them that bother me…</p><p>It’s like something muddy and sticky is slowly shrouding me… I can’t put it well, but it’s really creepy.</p><p>I think it’s just a gut feeling. It’s probably all in my head, but…</p><p>It kinda reminds me of the past… like the atmosphere of that day, when Dad never got home, and everything fell apart.”</p><h3 id="13-2">/ 13</h3><p>&gt; Auditorium<br><an hour later></an></p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/shiQSGY.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I’m home, Yumenosaki~☆”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha, it really feels like home, doesn’t it~? The familiarity of this stage calms me so much.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Same here. Throughout SS preliminaries, we’ve only been transported to different parts of the town, so… we haven’t been able to stand here.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Don’t let your guard down just because we’re at home. If our opponent chose this location, it must be because they’re confident in their chance of victory.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right. Although, as the number of reigning idols becomes fewer, it’s becoming harder to wage matches too, locking us into a stalemate situation…</p><p>We’ve had a hard time deciding our next move, so in a way, this match is a lifesaver.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. Just a while ago, we even decided to get it over with and wage a match against Eden!</p><p>Well, they refused though, despite our hard-earned resolve to stake our lives.</p><p>And then, as if in exchange, a surviving CosPro idol accepted our challenge…</p><p>It’s like, we challenged the master but the disciple came out? Kind of thing.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. But even if they don’t hold up to Eden, I don’t doubt this idol group is at least second to them in competence.</p><p>Psych yourselves up. It’ll be a nice exercise before our fight against Eden on the real stage.</p><p>Seeing the number of leftover idols, if we win here, there’ll be exactly eight idol groups left standing. That means prelims will be done with, and we’ll be moving onto the finals.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Meaning even if this opponent become our vassal, Eden won’t have the chance to take them back, right?</p><p>We’ll get to stay on the winning side as time runs out… I think.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. Though it won’t be easy; it’s the greatest climax of the prelims.</p><p>I’m sure CosPro prefers their idol to be left around for the finals instead of us.</p><p>The fans who have been supporting the CosPro idols all over the city are gathering to Yumenosaki.</p><p>Location-wise, we’re right at home, but going by fanbase, we’re the one surrounded by enemy.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah. Especially since, according to Yumenosaki’s rules, the Auditorium is meant to prioritize the general audience instead of the students.</p><p>The seats are getting filled by CosPro fans.</p><p>Outdoor stages aside, the auditorium has ‘capacity’. If this continues and the entire audience seats are buried in CosPro supporters, we’ll have no chance of winning.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. It seems our enemy had a strategy ready so they could win even if they have to fight Trickstar in Yumenosaki.</p><p>CosPro really isn’t to be looked down upon.</p><p>Eden is enough of a threat on its own, but CosPro as a whole is the hottest, biggest power within the idol industry right now, despite its young age.</p><p>If we have only ourselves to depend on, we’ll just be putting up a futile fight and getting crushed.</p><p>However, we have allies on our side. Look, the influx of obvious CosPro supporters has stopped. I think we can put up a fight with this.</p><p>Most likely, the student council president or one of his people has changed up the rules to prevent the auditorium from being buried in CosPro people.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Uh, no. He can’t change rules that easily, you know… Just what’s up with your image of the boss of us stuco, Hokuto?</p><p>I think what this indicates is that we’ve obtained more outside fans. We’ve fought and weaved bonds with different idols of the country throughout the course of SS, remember?</p><p>They’ve gathered here for our sake. It’s not the prez using his authority to make things go well―we called in these fans.</p><p>We paved the path to the future with our own power.</p><p>Of course, prez and the others are likely working in the background too, helping to make sure the enemy won’t have their way.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. We can’t leave it all to other people, right? We have to take that glory for ourselves!</p><p>Even if, in the worst scenario, all the audience in the venue are under CosPro’s influence――</p><p>All we have to do is make them into our fans, right, guys?♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ohh, now Ukki’s gotten full of himself! All right! We can win with this…☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What? That doesn’t make sense. Well, strategy and all that stuff no longer matter once we’re on stage, so…</p><p>Our job is to sing and dance to our fill, for the sake of the people who came to watch.</p><p>Let’s do our best, guys. We’re going to win, and advance to the finals.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Sure! Let’s shine and sparkle at the throne of the idol business~☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha, to be honest, it’s such a cruel joke that even after all these harsh fights, we still have an even harsher final stage waiting, but…</p><p>Well, when you’ve come this far, you can’t help but want the trophy, yeah?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Right! We’re aiming for conquest! You know… I might have been pretty unassertive all this time, but I actually like being ‘first’♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Of course, since you’re Trickstar too, Ukki!

Pretty anticlimatic, to be honest.”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/QqukAA3.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. The audience seats being filled with mostly CosPro supporters was a source of worry, but…</p><p>I think there was an undeniable difference in skills between the opponent and us.</p><p>So this is just the expected resultーfeel free to think this way and puff out your chest proud. We’ve grown strong enough to render the enemy’s sly cunnings useless, and triumphed over them.</p><p>Let’s hold our heads high as we stand on this stage. We’re one of the few, chosen eight groups who have been permitted to participate in the SS final stage.</p><p>We were once nobodies, but let’s engrave Trickstar’s name here and now.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahh, it’s so comfy… (<em>snuggle</em>)♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Stop rolling around, Akehoshi. There are already people in the audience seats; don’t be showing something unsightly, you.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. In Akehoshi-kun’s case, don’t they find his pet-like motions to be cute?</p><p>I don’t know if it’s because he keeps a dog, but he acts like a dog sometimes♪”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/X5gZEUy.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I love dogs~! Aah, I wish I could’ve brought Daikichi here too! I wanted him to see us shine!</p><p>Fufu. Daikichi and Mom were my support during those hard times, you know.

She loves herself, that girl.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hmm~? Then wouldn’t she make a great idol? Just kidding…♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “You’re right, though.

My mom’s been inconspicuously following us too…</p><p>Don’t you guys recall seeing a woman hiding behind a telephone pole sometimes?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Oh, so that was your mum, Makoto… She’s a pale-skinned beauty, huh~? Gotta admit, I thought she was a ghost. Got a bit of a scare back there.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Hmm? What’s up, Hokuto? You seem antsy… Looking for something?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, I just got curious too and wanted to find my family.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “? Hokke Papa and Mama are clearly in the official guest seats over there, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I know.</p><p>Ah, there she is… Grandma――she said she might not be able to come since her legs have been feeling weak, but…</p><p>I’m glad she’s come to support her grandson on his biggest stage.</p><p>Geh… the Masked Freak is sitting next to grandma… Right, they were acquainted or something?</p><p>Was he being considerate and brought Grandma here, like carrying her here?</p><p>Oh well. Akehoshi, perhaps you’re feeling lonely since your family haven’t shown up, but I’m sure they’re watching from somewhere, in front of the TV.</p><p>Just have faith in that. If you’re still lonely, know that we’re here with you. Is that not enough?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nuh-huh, having you guys with me gives me a lot of courage… We can do anything; revolutions, miracles. I have faith in that, whatever happens.”</p><p>(Mom, Daikichi… Dad too, are you watching from the heavens?</p><p>Look at me. I’ve become an idol.)</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “…Hey, don’t you guys find it weird?</p><p>According to the program, the eight groups who survived for the final stage are supposed to rise up to the stage at the beginning――</p><p>Where we’re all supposed to introduce ourselves to the audience, and draw lots to decide who competes against who, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, the final stage is a classic knockout tournament―where the winners get to stay and the losers are dropped out of the battle.</p><p>There are three rounds, and if we pass all of them, we’re the winner.</p><p>I’m hoping it’s the final round that we get to fight Eden, but only God knows…</p><p>The bracket will be decided through fair drawing of lots, from now on.</p><p>…That’s what I heard.

It’s getting dark in here.</p><p>I’ve got a bad feeling… S-Should we retreat to the stage wing for the time being?</p><p>But we’ll look kinda stupid… To leave the stage, we need to use the passageway that cuts through the audience seats, after all.</p><p>It’s gonna draw attention.

Well, it’s SS; I don’t think they’ll stop the event here but…</p><p>That might be better for us right now.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “As if. It isn’t better at all… I won’t accept it being shut down here… Then what did I work so hard for until now…?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Akehoshi, don’t force yourself to speak. You sound like you might die anytime… and your body is trembling.</p><p>Anyway, I’m hugging you, okay? You come here too, Anzu… Is there anything else we can do for you? Ahh, why must this happen…?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “<em>You</em> calm down too, Leader… Isn’t ‘calm and composed’ your selling point? First, we need to learn and understand the situation. We decide how to deal with it later.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “R-Right… You seem self-possessed. That’s a help. My mind just went blank; things took turn to the direction I feared most.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “I’m not calm, you know. I’m just distancing myself from the side of me that’s in total panic.</p><p>Also, the vice prez is weak at unforeseeable emergency situations, so he’s always careful with it, he said. He taught me ways to cope.</p><p>First, take a deep breath. Close your eyes and count to ten.</p><p>Take your time with it. Then match your heartbeat with the person you’re holding hands or hugging with. Slowly, guys, together… Relax.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Y-Yeah… (<em>breathes in and out</em>)…”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “One, two, three…”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “(<em>inhales, exhales</em>)…”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “…Fufu. That’s awesome. Our heartbeats are really pulsating together. And I really feel lighter.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Great. Well, not that anything’s actually gotten resolved.</p><p>We’ll just hit a dead end if we stay in panic, so cruel as it might be, I need you guys to hold it together.</p><p>It’s a do-or-die situation. Probably the greatest we’ve ever faced.”</p><h3 id="16-2">/ 16</h3><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Fufu. You’re so dependable, Sally… Thanks. By myself I would’ve lost to the pressure. So I’m really glad, that you guys are with me.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha! Don’t make light of my endurance~ This is my greatest strength.</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/n3sxOnE.jpg"></p><p>Unlike you guys, I really came from an ordinary background. I’ve lived to this age without experiencing any tragedy or hardships, just taking it easy.</p><p>Even me becoming an idol was because my middle school friend told me―‘<em>You would make a good idol, Mao-kun</em>’…</p><p>And I just went along for a laugh. ‘<em>Seriously~? You’re making me blush~ Then maybe I should become one</em>~’―or something…</p><p>Since the school was close to home anyway, I took the entrance exam half as a joke.</p><p>Plus, Ritsu enrolled a year before too, so I was expecting to befriend him again after a while.</p><p>But the result of my entrance exam was so good, that I was starting to think, ‘<em>Maybe I’m a genius</em>?’ I mean, I only got average scores for my other entrance exams to normal high schools.</p><p>So I thought, maybe I could really become an idol… I watched a lot of programs on TV and imagined…</p><p>How interesting and pleasant it must feel to become a special existence like these people.</p><p>And so, thinking… ‘<em>Alright, I should give it a try</em>!’, I enrolled to Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>I gave a slightly smarter answer during the interview the other day, didn’t I?</p><p>But honestly, <em>that’s it</em>. Then a bunch of things happened until I arrived at today. I only went along with the current, mistaking myself for a genius――</p><p>But in truth, I’m probably your run-of-the-mill average guy.</p><p>I wasn’t born burdened with some special fate like a story protagonist… so sometimes, I got envious of you guys, but…</p><p>I think I’m glad for my average self now. No trauma, HP constantly at max…</p><p>Nothing to wrench my gut. I’m full of energy!</p><p>When it looks like my comrade might get hurt, I can protect you and become your shield.</p><p>Plus, I’m sturdy and can hold out for long. I can’t do <em>everything</em>, but I know what I can do now.</p><p>Subaru. Hokuto. Makoto. Anzu. We can’t let it end here, right? We’re doing a miraculous upset from now on, aren’t we?</p><p>Anything else would be weird. Just so you know, I don’t accept abrupt endings.</p><p>Let’s persist on. Hold on through the pain and suffering just a bit more―and if that’s too hard for you, you can cling onto me…</p><p>Cry; and when you’ve spilled all the heavy, murky things, let’s rise up.</p><p>Our fight is just getting started, right?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah… Thank you, Sally. For some reason, I’ve gotten calmer after hearing you talk.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Heh, tales of the past get really embarrassing though. Not in my character too.</p><p>When you keep talking, doesn’t your brain completely focus on trying to get the other person understand?</p><p>Then before you know it, your worries just don’t matter anymore.</p><p>My underclassmen in the student council often went to me for advice, y’know…</p><p>And after grumbling and moaning over it, even when we couldn’t find an actual solution, they’d feel as though their concern really was puny by the end of it.</p><p>This case, of course, isn’t one that can be passed off as ‘puny’, but…</p><p>I want to give everything I can do―my experience, everything―to help you… Subaru.</p><p>Nah, not just that. I don’t want Trickstar to halt here.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah… I feel the same. I don’t want it to end here.</p><p>But it’s so strange. It’s weird; I can’t seem to lift even a finger… even though you’re all holding my hands, hugging me, sharing your warmth with me…</p><p>I’m pathetic, aren’t I… I’m afraid of the stage. I don’t want to go back there, even though singing and dancing with a smile in front of everyone was something I loved the most…</p><p>It’s so weird, right? Just what is wrong with me…? I’m just really afraid right now…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…I don’t think you can help that. If I were at your position, I might not be able to take a step forward, like you.</p><p>Today, just a while ago, you experienced a deep blow to your identity. In front of your beloved audience, no less…</p><p>If my parents were slandered and defamed in front of me, I think just like you, I wouldn’t be able to keep my sanity. Especially since considering our standing, we can’t object carelessly.</p><p>It must be hard. I understand, Akehoshi… You and I, we’re twin souls.</p><p>We were born to similar standings. But a basic and decisive difference between us led us to diverging paths.</p><p>Due to some trick of fate, we’re now by each other’s side. Aiming for the same dream together. You’re not alone; everyone here is on your side.</p><p>…I’m frustrated that I can’t do more than encourage you like this.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “No… It’s what I need right now, so I’m happy to hear it. Thanks, Hokke.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “…I’m a poor speaker and I’m bad at comforting people, so I’ll move on the direction of resolving this situation.</p><p>Uhh, a quick browse on the internet indicates the riot inside the venue is getting calmer.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. I think the audience were instructed to turn off their smartphones inside the dome…</p><p>And it wasn’t livestreamed. But it’s becoming a hot topic on the internet?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “You can’t keep people’s mouths shut in this day and age… especially since we have a lot of people working in mass media among the audience this time.</p><p>Amateurs are the scariest, though.</p><p>Information is being released and spread rapidly, so it’s shaping into a truth by consensus.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I see… That’s really cruel. The matter of Akehoshi’s father is already something from years ago.</p><p>Things have finally cooled down to the point that people who ‘know’ only mostly know the rumors.</p><p>It’s been treated as a taboo in the idol industry, hushed up so no one would touch upon it…</p><p>But now that’s all gone to waste. After this, things won’t be the same.</p><p>Whenever Akehoshi stands on stage as an idol, everyone would recall what happened today and point at him, saying, ‘<em>That’s the son of</em> the <em>Akehoshi</em>’…</p><p>No one could ever look at him as just an idol.</p><p>No way I would accept something so unjust. This is a trap, a scheme; I’ll speak out, whatever it takes.</p><p>I’ll convince the SS Staff Association to declare the video as a completely baseless fabrication.</p><p>Even that might end as an exercise in futility, but… I can’t think of any other hand right now.”</p><h3 id="17">/ 17</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (No, if I use ‘that’, I can turn the table on them…? But how do I use it?</p><p>An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth―that <em>can’t</em> be the right answer.</p><p>And with just a wrong step, what I do will result in all the darkness of the idol industry… no, of the whole entertainment business to surface.</p><p>The ideals and dreams we’ve longed and aimed for will disappear.</p><p>Can I really shoulder that burden? I’ll have satisfaction, but what else?</p><p>There must be something else; a future where Akehoshi, everyone, can smile…</p><p>The video happened. We can’t rewind time. We can’t erase the past…</p><p>This is probably something we, and especially Akehoshi, have to deal with sooner or later.</p><p>But does it have to be now?)</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Umm, Hidaka-kun, I thought you might have some idea…</p><p>This might be an incredibly rude question, but just how much truth was in that stream?</p><p>It’ll change how we deal with this situation. If it was all a shameless lie, we can continue to stand dignified. But if even a bit of it was true…</p><p>We’ll be shouldering part of the sin,</p><p>by hiding and falsifying the truth for the sake of a comrade.</p><p>I don’t know if that would be the right move or not, but…</p><p>If not doing that would result in losing Akehoshi-kun’s smile forever, I want to do it. I want to save my friend even if it means becoming a villain.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “The ultimate choice, huh… To save a friend, or to stay an honorable idol. I would prefer that these two futures aren’t exclusive too, but…</p><p>I think we’ll eventually be forced to make that difficult choice.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You know… It’s fine. You can cut me off if things are really beyond saving.</p><p>You’re all so kind, so it might not cross your minds at all.</p><p>But you guys should be able to insist that you’ve been deceived by a criminal’s son and forced to go along with his wrongdoing.</p><p>If those choices mean we all have to lose something, then I’d rather offer myself up.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t be stupid. We’re on the side of justice. We’ve got to let them have it, whoever was using this petty scheme to avoid facing us properly as idols.</p><p>We <em>have</em> to take down those evils. Step on them, and laugh to the heavens as they roll beneath our feet.</p><p>That’s more like us, and that’ll allow us to advance forward without sacrificing anyone, right?</p><p>Don’t give up, Akehoshi. There’s got to be something. A solution.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “But… I actually don’t know.</p><p>What sort of person Dad really was.</p><p>He was like a radiant star to me. He was my idol…</p><p>My very first memory was of me singing while holding hands with Dad and Mom that I love…</p><p>Dad was always so busy, so he was rarely home. But if I just switched the TV on, I’d find him smiling there.</p><p>Watching him with Mom was the most blissful time of my everyday.</p><p>Apparently, as a child, I had no idea how distant the world beyond the TV actually was, and kept reaching out my hands and nuzzling up against the screen.</p><p>When Dad came home once in a while, I’d be jumping for joy, running up to him for a hug… and Dad would happily lift me up and swing me around.</p><p>Then we’d sing together. Watching us would be Mom and Daikichi, clapping hands, jumping up and down…</p><p>We’d hold a small live of just us family.</p><p>But one day, Dad wouldn’t come home no matter how long we waited. It was my birthday, and Dad promised he would come.</p><p>Mom already prepared my share, Dad’s share, and Daikichi’s share of dinner, and all we had to do was wait.</p><p>Maybe his job got extended, we thought, so we turned on the TV like usual. To see if Dad was in any of the live music shows.</p><p>But what’s airing was an emergency news.</p><p>With a pale face, a news announcer reported… something we couldn’t comprehend――</p><p>That Dad killed someone while on stage.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Kil―… M-Murder!? Tha-That’s a lie… right?</p><p>No. You’re wrong, Akehoshi-kun. It was an accident.</p><p>Since Saegusa-kun seemed so insistent to bring up your dad during our joint interview, I got curious and researched about it too.</p><p>Official record is that it was an accident. In the live show of Akehoshi-kun’s dad, who was a super idol of the time, a crazed fan was pushing themself through the crowd――</p><p>They tried to get upstage, but got into a dispute and fell on their own… Apparently, it hit a bad place and they died from that.</p><p>Your dad didn’t even push them or anything, Akehoshi-kun.</p><p>It was just an unfortunate accident… He wasn’t even charged for it. Wasn’t what you saw a misinformation from a news channel who jumped at the wrong conclusion too soon?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Maybe. But that was just the start of it.</p><p>They investigated my dad thoroughly after that… and many atrocities were brought to light. I don’t believe it even now, but…</p><p>Illegal donation and bribery. Physical abuse towards colleagues… With one evidence after another being brought to light, Dad was arrested. As a criminal.</p><p>The worst idol in history―that’s what the mass called him.”</p><h3 id="18">/ 18</h3><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “They held sense of ethics at higher value back then… so Dad was disparaged, blamed, until he hit rock bottom.</p><p>Some passionate fans who believed in him, in their disappointment, were even throwing themselves off heights…</p><p>The chaos just festered, no one could stop it anymore.</p><p>I still remember. The police officers breaking into our house and making a mess of it…</p><p>The telephone that kept ringing. Everyone we met giving us the cold shoulders.</p><p>That’s the wife and son of <em>that</em> Akehoshi, they said… looking at us like we’re demons. Speaking behind our backs, shattering our windows, throwing rotten eggs at us.</p><p>I was scared… Mom and Daikichi were my only allies.</p><p>During those times, romantic affairs of idols were also considered scandals, so…</p><p>Dad actually married Mom in secret.</p><p>But that’s also not approved, and the people who were in love with Dad…</p><p>…spoke especially foully of Mom and started reviling Dad. Calling him a traitor, a criminal―a scum.</p><p>In the end, Dad died in prison with practically no chance to explain himself. From severe illness.</p><p>He was always a frail person, and his mental condition tended to greatly affect his health.</p><p>I couldn’t meet him often in prison, but when I saw him for the last time, Dad was already getting colder… It was as though he aged overnight; he was an entirely different person.</p><p>Since that day, we started living in concealment. Trying not to stand out, so no one would recognize us…</p><p>But Mom and I could never bring ourselves to change our surnames.</p><p>I mean, if we do that, it feels like Dad would really disappear. The best idol in the world, to Mom and I…</p><p>Ever since Dad vanished into the darkness, Mom stopped smiling. So I tried my best to make her smile. Because I love her.</p><p>I didn’t know anything else, so I copied Dad… I smiled and danced with a smile. All by myself, in Dad’s place…</p><p>I stuck it out for a long, long time… and Mom finally started smiling every once in a while. She’s become reintegrated into society now.</p><p>Back then and now, she was always my beautiful, gentle mom.</p><p>When rumors about Dad became almost unsettlingly quiet…</p><p>We returned to our current house near Yumenosaki, which we deserted in escape back then.</p><p>We cleaned up little by little, restoring the wrecked rooms back to their original state…</p><p>…and despite Mom’s opposition, I enrolled to Yumenosaki to become an idol like Dad.</p><p>I wanted to be someone who shines radiantly, like he did.</p><p>No, maybe by doing that… I was actually hoping to revive my dad, who was as though erased by world.</p><p>I wanted everyone to know my favorite idol too. But because he’s not here anymore, in his place…</p><p>…I wanted to spread something shiny and precious to the whole world.</p><p>Because that was Dad’s wish, and it’s become my dream too.</p><p>I was so close, guys. It took a lot of time and hard work. Destroying something is very easy, but it’s incredibly difficult to put it back together. That applies to everything in the world―every single thing.</p><p>Even so, I waded through the process and took a new step. It didn’t start out easy, but then I met you guys… I met with Trickstar.</p><p>We caused lots of miracles, granted lots of dreams… Each new day was full of happiness.</p><p>I could aim for the brilliant future Dad couldn’t arrive at.</p><p>But then look. It took a single blow to destroy everything. Everything’s broken into smithereens and vanished into the darkness again.</p><p>If this is what’s waiting anyway… then maybe I shouldn’t have tried to become an idol.</p><p>I should’ve stayed curled up in an inconspicuous corner… along with an unsmiling Mom, staring at a blank screen on the TV.</p><p>Maybe just being able to do that, just being alive…</p><p>…is something ‘the son of a criminal’―someone who inherits the title of ‘the worst idol in history’―should be satisfied with.</p><p>Thanks to you guys, I was starting to believe that’s not the case, but…</p><p>I don’t have that confidence anymore.</p><p>Hokuto. Mao. Makoto. Anzu… I reached out my hand, and finally grasped it, you know?</p><p>I met with people who would hold my hands and laugh with me.</p><p>Do I have to let go of all that and go back to that lonely, dark place?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…</p><p>…I’ve decided.</p><p>Anzu. Sorry but I’m leaving Akehoshi to you. Yuuki, Isara. You two come with me.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Eh? No, uh, why? Start by explaining yourself! Contrary to your looks, you just take action as soon as you come up with something, huh~? Stop a bit to think, will ya?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Even if I don’t think, you guys will do it in my place, right? Anyway, just come with me… Please, it’s a plea of a lifetime.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “S-Sure, that’s fine, but… where are we going?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “To Eden’s place.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eh? Ehh!? Are you suspecting Eden to be behind that stream?</p><p>Are you… under the impression that they did this awful thing… and are thinking to give them a good punch?</p><p>That won’t solve anything! And I don’t think Eden is behind this!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Huh? Seriously? But Eden is the one who benefits from this fatal blow to our side, right?</p><p>Looking at the other participants for the final stage, Eden is definitely the one winning SS once we’re done away with.</p><p>Those other participants seem to be under CosPro’s influence, after all.</p><p>If they just eliminate us, they’ll be able to win without a sweat like what has been predetermined.</p><p>Among Eden, Saegusa especially has been trying to rile us up with his extreme comments. This really seems like something he would do.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I understand, but this entire scheme is too sloppy to be Saegusa-kun.</p><p>Even without doing something like this, Eden’s chance of victory was high to begin with.</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/o7a8DUF.jpg"></p><p>We’re quite spent by the events of the prelims, so…</p><p>If according to the original plan, the final stage starts immediately after drawing lots, meaning we’d have to perform at our exhausted state, due to not getting any rest.</p><p>But now we’ve been given the time to rest, right?</p><p>A blitzkrieg would’ve got rid of us the easiest, so wasn’t it weird to pause for a streaming there?”</p><h3 id="19">/ 19</h3><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I think this wasn’t Saegusa-kun’s intention. He’s not <em>that</em> stupid…</p><p>Looking at the pattern in his actions so far, it’s unlikely he would choose this method.</p><p>We’ve suffered some due to that boy’s schemes.</p><p>As a result, most of the surviving participants for the final stage are related to CosPro one way or the other, making it practically their perfect victory.</p><p>I kept talking about causing miracles in one-in-a-million chance but honestly… even if we win, they’ll still profit greatly.</p><p>CosPro’s influence within the entertainment business would still be greatly strengthened.</p><p>They profit whether they win or lose; but if they can win, all the better―this is a pattern in Saegusa-kun’s strategies.</p><p>That boy’s an entrepreneur. He doesn’t try to cross burning bridges.</p><p>In my view, even his provocative gestures were only a strategy meant to scare his opponents into thinking that ‘he might really do it’.</p><p>He’s a snake that calmly manipulates others with his glib tongue. Careless frontal attacks aren’t like Saegusa-kun.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nn~… Then maybe he thinks it’s safer to crush us, since we’re the only unpredictable component here?</p><p>That’s why he went for the kill with that video, as an insurance or something.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No, that’s impossible. I also researched about the things they’re hiding, so we could oppose if he were to use this tactic against us.</p><p>Since he kept implicating that he had a firm grasp on our weakness――</p><p>I wanted us to be able to point a blade against their throat too.</p><p>After studying about Nagisa-san’s past that you heard from Eve during Autumn Live, Isara-kun…</p><p>I reeled in a bunch of info as well, until I found threatening secrets of them.</p><p>Saegusa-kun’s background, the matter of Sazanami-kun’s dad… It’s not a pretty tactic, so I’ve been keeping it secret from you guys.</p><p>But as for the case of Akehoshi-kun’s father… Maybe it was deliberately covered up, because at this day and age, it was hard to find much on him.</p><p>He seemed to have a deep relation with that godfather-like person mentioned in Eve’s story.</p><p>The supposedly discovered ‘crimes’ of Akehoshi-kun’s father all lead to that person.</p><p>That’s my conclusion upon looking at the information I’ve gathered in full.</p><p>I think that person was trying to make Akehoshi-kun’s father his successor.</p><p>Because your father was his favorite super idol… or simply, because that person was a fan.</p><p>He was a villain in every way possible, but I think he loved idols from the heart.</p><p>His methods were dirty, but it was thanks to him that the idol industry developed.</p><p>So, what I’m trying to say is, uhhh… if one were to allude to Akehoshi-kun’s dad…</p><p>It could also bring that person’s villainy, which they’ve worked so hard to cover up, to light.</p><p>And that could be harm to Eden at present, seeing as Nagisa-san used to be under that person’s shelter…</p><p>…and Saegusa-kun is possibly a successor to him.</p><p>Most people don’t dance that easily to what the media feeds them these days.</p><p>They’ll try to dig up what’s under to satisfy their curiosity, make their own conclusion, and crack wide open secrets of the past that were thrown into the dark pit.</p><p>Eden is the one hiding a successor and an adopted son of a criminal here, and an irrefutably terrible one at that: the Mr. Godfather.</p><p>They’ll be as deep in trouble as we are when their secrets are out.</p><p>So showing that video was really all pain and no gain for Eden.</p><p>They weren’t cornered enough to take risks. It’s all meaningless. They had no reason to evoke a plan that might bite back at them.</p><p>So our culprit isn’t Eden. They’re probably in as much panic right now.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. I see. All right; all the better then. We need to see Eden whatever it takes…</p><p>They might be able to help us.</p><p>No, maybe…we’ll be able to overcome this dilemma.</p><p>We might be able to stand up against this danger and our common enemy by joining hands as fellow idols.</p><p>If the members of Eden are idols just like us… then they can potentially become not our greatest adversary, but our strongest ally.</p><p>Let’s hurry. I’m confrontational apparently, so I can’t seem to negotiate with my opponents in peace, even in pretense.</p><p>I’ll need the help of Isara, who’s good at that kind of thing, and Yuuki, who probably holds the most information here.</p><p>Help me. Please. I need your strength.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Of course. I’ll do whatever I can do.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Same with me. I’ll place my faith and follow behind you, Hidaka-kun, like I’ve done so far.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Thank you. …Wait for us, Akehoshi. We’ll be back with good news.</p><p>We’ll make you into an idol. I’m a big fan of the idol you.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “That, and you’re a most precious friend and comrade to us!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “That’s right; we love you lots~ So believe and wait, yeah?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Guys… O-Okay.

Maybe I’ll even cause trouble for Tomoe Foundation…? But well, they’ll probably just take it as the profligate second son ducking back home after kicking up a stupid fuss, and look at me appalled.</p><p>I don’t really have anything to lose, so… I’ll show my dignity and sense of justice here.</p><p>I’m sorry, Jun-kun. You were finally able to stand on the stage of SS you’ve always dreamed of, but everything has gone to waste thanks to this superfluous scheme…</p><p>You must be disappointed, right? You can cry, okay?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Haa? Why’d that make you apologize, Ohii-san? Kindly explain? You always choose the strangest times to say sorry.</p><p>Yet when <em>I’m</em> all pissed off, you just keep on with that grin.</p><p>…’s fine, you know, Ohii-san. I’m a lucky guy.</p><p>Having the stupid old man’s dreams forced on me, I couldn’t accept my reality but held on with my everything anyway… Yet I couldn’t bud, only gathering soot…</p><p>I only ever brooded, but then you approached me like a dolt and told me ‘<em>You have a good voice!</em>’ and all that…</p><p>Then in your whim, you instructed me on a small lesson session, right?</p><p>Do you remember, Ohii-san? That time, I was shocked from the bottom of my heart, you know. In Reimei, non-Special Students are treated like mass produced cheap slaves.</p><p>But you spoke to me like it was natural. Then you came down at me, haughtily lectured me…</p><p>And I thought, <em>Oh, so I’m just a toy to fill up this noble kid’s free time</em>.</p><p>But then the next day you called me to talk, invited me to form a unit with you…</p><p>And I thought, <em>What the hell’s this guy saying? None of it makes sense, is he an idiot?</em></p><p>But also, I was happy. I felt honored; I was grateful. You were a ray of hope illuminating the dirty alleys I thought I inhabited.</p><p>It felt good just to be showered in your light, y’see.

Oh Jun-kun! You love me so surprisingly a lot, don’t you!?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Haa? Our relationship isn’t about love or hate, right? I can’t separate from you just because I hate you; aren’t we supposed to be one in body and soul?</p><p>At least try to remember your own words, you dumb noble.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Fufu. That’s right. It’s just as you say, Jun-kun.</p><p>Ahh… the dirty animal I picked up that day has grown so splendidly. You are worth the love and effort I poured into raising you; I feel rewarded for my hardships.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “I’ve got a bunch of things to say, but… don’t relax; put some spirit into it, okay? I’m still immature and you’re the one I rely on.</p><p>…I’m fuming, y’know, Ohii-san. My blood is boiling at those guys who set up this damn unnecessary scheme.</p><p>Does the show biz just stay like this no matter the era? They haven’t grown an inch since my old man’s days! Pisses me off!</p><p>I thought Sagami Jin fought against the unfairness of the business and fixed it some?</p><p>But is this how much that bastard can do!? Man, no choice but to fix it myself then!</p><p>&lt;GODDAMN&gt;! Come at me if you’ve got anything to say! I won’t be done away with as easily as my old man!</p><p>My name might be hard to read, but carve it into your minds! I’m Sazanami Jun!</p><p>I’m the son of ‘that Sazanami’ that you guys once made into an accessory for the super idol! Well, I bet you don’t even remember!</p><p>Why don’t I fix things so you all will remember me for life, and never plot this kind of dumb scheme anymore~?!</p><p>You guys―you garbage and your damned ways―I’ll toss you all into the cesspool! Bet you’ll look good in there~!”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Hey now! Jun-kun, <em>hush</em>! Is there no way of fixing that foul tongue of yours?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Hah! I’m already trying to be polite, y’know~? Don’t like it? Well, excuse me then!”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Geez. It’s not just about tacking on polite words at the end, you know. I wish you’d learn to have more class… if you really plan to stand beside me from now on too.</p><p>Learn the ways of the nobles. I’ll hold your hand through every step, Jun-kun.</p><p>Ahh… Even though Brother scolded me often for it, it seems there’s no fixing my capriciousness either♪”</p><h3 id="2-4">/ 2</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hey. How long are you planning to flirt around there? You two get along as well as ever.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Oh no, not as well as you guys! The gentlemen of Trickstar, bringing revolution upon the world through the power of friendship! I quite admire you guys, and would like to learn from you on that, you know♪</p><p>You all can stake your lives for the sake of your comrades, and you will stand up to the greatest of schemes and adversaries without faltering… You’re all so cool. I’m cheering for you.</p><p>Me? I’m likelier to leave Jun-kun to fend for himself and save myself when worse comes to worst! I really can’t stand painful things and such sufferings since the past!</p><p>So to me, you guys are worthy of praise… Please, fight on without giving up.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Thank you. But Tomoe-senpai, I don’t think you’d ever run away and leave Sazanami alone… In fact, I picture you’d do everything to shield him in dangerous times, and end up dying from it.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes! You understand me so well, Hokuto-kun! I wish Jun-kun knows me as well as you do! It’s so troubling how slow he is!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Hidaka-san, can you refrain from feeding this guy’s big head?</p><p>Sure, he’s the type who shines better the more excited he is, but to be honest, it’s mostly just annoying.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. Just like our Akehoshi, then. I get that feeling, Sazanami. We both have it hard, don’t we.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Ahaha.

Sorry to interrupt the pleasant chit-chat, gentlemen! Salute~☆</p><p>Since we’re still enemies, can I ask to not be so friendly with each other? I mean, it might make it hard to kill you when push comes to shove! Ahahaha☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Saegusa. Have you finished the preparation like I asked?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Who knows? I shall leave it to your imagination! At least I’ll tell you this: I am a liar, so do not put too much faith in me!</p><p>I <em>will</em> betray you if the need calls, you see. Please don’t get funny ideas, like that I’m siding with you, or that I’m most definitely to see through our partnership to the end.</p><p>Because I’m ready to chew off your throats anytime.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “<em>After</em> we take down our common enemy, I hope. …Naturally, we’re gonna put our all into our performance too.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Splendid! I appreciate it; as they say, even fools have their use! Ahh, I’m glad to meet you; I can finally eliminate the thing I’ve racked my brain over for so long!</p><p>Surely you don’t mind me squeezing every profit out of you ‘till you’re all bones! I shall treat you well as long as you’re of some use! But don’t forget that I am always aiming at your back!</p><p>Put your guard down and I’ll deliver to you a painful blow with a bang♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. You seem to be in a good mood, Saegusa.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Not at all? I’m irritated! Just as it was getting fun, they <em>had</em> to interfere from the side~ now all my plans are in tatters!</p><p>Whatever should I do with CosPro’s feeble-minded top brass…? Well, it’s fine I guess, since I can seem to crush most of them due to their action this time!</p><p>Ahh, but I can’t hold all this anger! Should I braid His Excellency’s hair to relieve my stress~?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ah… So Nagisa-kun’s sometimes funny hairstyle was all your doing.</p><p>We have a live show coming, so don’t style his hair too funny, okay?”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I enjoy it, though; it’s probably how pets feel when being groomed.</p><p>…But anyway, accomplishing our purpose comes first.</p><p>…I will perform perfectly, like the idols Father loved.</p><p>…Not just that; I will enjoy this moment together with you all.</p><p>…Trickstar. Let me thank you.</p><p>…Thanks to you, my father doesn’t have to be exposed and unfairly condemned.</p><p>…Everyone might perceive him as the root of evils, and it’s true he committed crimes.</p><p>…But he was a kind father to me. I think he truly loved me.</p><p>…So I can’t forgive―for everything my father loved, for the concept of idols, to be hurt like this.</p><p>…Insolent it may be, I shall bestow judgment in place of God and the Heavens.</p><p>…Let us fight together, hand in hand, children of Yumenosaki Academy.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Sure.

Doesn’t it excite you, Hiyori-kun?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes. There’s no need to venture out to look, is there? Paradise lies here.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Everyone! The preparation is all ready, so please stand by!”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Uh, you talk like a staff, but don’t forget to stand on stage, okay?</p><p>Weren’t the four of you together supposed to make Trickstar? You reflect off each other’s radiance and glisten despite anything! That’s you guys, isn’t it?”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/gwqBOxc.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. The <em>five of us</em>… to be more precise. She’s not the assertive type, always so self-effacing―but we have an important comrade who was the one to kindle our first light.</p><p>It’s the wonderful producer who made these outfits for us. She can’t stand on stage with us, but she’s always by our side.</p><p>Please don’t forget about our dearest Anzu-chan, if you will.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ahh―excuse my rudeness then. Nn~… While Trickstar have strong allies backing them up, we might be in disadvantage due to our inside people dragging us down instead.</p><p>Well, I have no intention of losing, of course?

Let’s greet the new year with a smile, everyone…♪”</p><h3 id="3-3">/ 3</h3><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Well then. Let’s begin, shall we?</p><p>You all fulfilled your promise. You’ve brilliantly triumphed over strong rivals, and advanced ‘your pieces’ to the third round.</p><p>All that, despite being hurt by the unpleasant stream that tossed this venue into chaos… and despite one of you being practically not of sound mind.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…</p><p>Yeah… I have no excuse. I’m sorry, guys. I’ve been mostly useless throughout the finals.</p><p>I ended up increasing your burdens by having you guys cover up for my part in the songs.</p><p>I’m sorry. Really. But my legs are trembling and they won’t move――”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Stop being so distant. We help each other in need, right? Isn’t it good enough that you manage to stand on stage without running away? I’m very proud of you, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Are you my mom or what, Hokke… But gee, I really showed something pathetic to all of you, didn’t I? Now I can never go against you guys for life.</p><p>But you know, guys? You really are amazing. Despite the unusual circumstances, you acted like proper idols.</p><p>Even though people were whispering, giving us funny looks… you guys didn’t object even a bit, and sang and danced with your all, forcing the atmosphere of the venue to change with you.</p><p>And before I knew it, everyone was cheering for us. Captivated, engrossed, clapping their hands… I felt so happy…</p><p>Nah―I think it made me realize something once more.</p><p>That we’re so awesome, so radiant… Maybe it’s because I couldn’t move like always and had to watch you guys from the back, but I felt this stronger than ever: You guys, all of you―you’re sparkling.</p><p>I wonder if I can still belong with you… It’ll be nice if I could. That’s what I think, from the bottom of my heart.</p><p>And then I just feel silly for being so afraid! I’m gonna sing with you guys too, in the third round!</p><p>I’m still a little scared, but even so! Please, let me sing!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “There’s no need to plea; you just have to wish for it.</p><p>It was the opposite back in DDD. We all couldn’t rise upstage… but you persisted on fighting while borrowing Anzu’s help, didn’t you?</p><p>It’s probably no good to keep looking back to the past, but…</p><p>It was your effort that day that brought us here in this place. So you never had to thank us, Akehoshi.</p><p>It’s a two-way street. When one of us falls, the others lend their hands; we’ve come so far by supporting each other that way, right?</p><p>Yesterday, today, and into tomorrow, surely. Let’s all walk towards the future together.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Of course, Hokke…♪”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Uhh~ <em>Ahem</em>. Why do <em>all</em> of you just resort to flirting when there’s chance~? We’re going nowhere like this, so can you save it for later?</p><p>Anyway, back to topic. We will henceforth commence the strategy.</p><p>Our objective is the indictment of the CosPro top brass, who had attempted a trap against you all.</p><p>We have looked into it to be sure as well, and embarrassingly enough, it really does turn out to be a blunder by our people.</p><p>Apparently some of the upper seats of our agency were concerned by Trickstar’s increasing exploits…</p><p>…and decided to set up a landmine, which they somehow believed to be an effective secret weapon.</p><p>I assume by portraying ‘that Akehoshi’ as a criminal and implicating Subaru-san who is his son is as much of a villain… they plan to rile up the mass and manipulate them.</p><p>Are they <em>stupid</em> or something? Do they really believe they can get away unharmed, after exposing the biggest scandal in the showbiz that the people before them worked hard to cover up?</p><p>So, we shall crush this silly conspiracy for the sake of the future of the show biz to come.</p><p>It’s just <em>finally</em> raking in as much money as I wanted it to. I can’t have the value of the entertainment industry itself to be dropping now.</p><p>It would greatly hurt my business~ So this is all inevitable.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Fufu. You love idols too, huh, Barry?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “I do not love or hate them. But I can’t have my job being hampered, so I’d like to get rid of annoying good-for-nothing employees as soon as I can.</p><p>This is quite convenient, to be honest. With this, the air on our place might get clearer and we might be able to move more freely.</p><p>Maybe we won’t have to bow down to the agency’s every little orders anymore.</p><p>We’ll have them let us do whatever we want… Those dumbasses think they’re so great just by getting older, acting like they’re gods or something―so I’ll gladly shoot them in the back.</p><p>Imagine the <em>thrill</em>! Ahaha, I can’t stop laughing! I’m so so glad that I’m a lowlife…☆”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Boy, you’re so great right now.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Tell me about it!

You guys are up next once we’re done with those bores. Just wait for it!</p><p>I’ve also been looking forward to this day, okay!?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Ahaha, yep. Y’know, Ibara… he looked so giddy while planning the strategy for SS. He’s angrier than he looks over the whole thing being messed up.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Fufu, you’re surprisingly a kid at heart too, Ibara.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Yes.

Good day.</p><p>Ah, maybe it’s more fitting to say ‘good evening’ now. It’s nighttime. The sky is clear and I’m sure you can see the stars in their prettiest.</p><p>But anyway… Hello. I’m Akehoshi Subaru.</p><p>I’m not used to speaking formally, so I apologize for any discourtesy in advance.</p><p>And also… I’m very sorry for today.</p><p>You all came here to see our performance, to see idols dancing and singing happily. I’m sure you’re confused, having been exposed to the backdoor dealings of the show biz and all that dark heavy stuff instead.</p><p>We’ll do something about it. It’ll be over soon. So please, listen to what I have to say. We have a gift of happy performances of your liking after this.</p><p>The video that played before the stage… That wasn’t fabrication. It was something put together from news reports that were really broadcast at the time.</p><p>My father was once called a super idol.</p><p>He was really popular… He was my pride and Mom’s; our most beloved person in the world. But he’s not here anymore.</p><p>He was branded a criminal by the world and died in prison without being cleared of that sin.</p><p>That’s a fact, and there is no changing the past anymore.</p><p>But I believe that the future can be changed.</p><p>So I will speak the truth: my father was falsely accused.</p><p>We have evidence. My best friend’s father―someone you all likely know as well―had secretly preserved records of that time.</p><p>He apparently submitted them to the police back then, but he was hushed up without them ever being investigated properly.</p><p>But he couldn’t stand that, and decided to keep those records safe.</p><p>The backup files he had at home were erased by someone who apparently snuck into the house. But the original records that he kept hidden just in case remain to this day.</p><p>I’ll submit them to the police once more. Also, the Tenshouin Zaibatsu and the Tomoe Foundation…</p><p>…will apparently help persuade the police to investigate the case properly, and make sure there is no unfairness at play.</p><p>It appears that stream was shown to you by a small part of the Cosmic Production, out of some intent… malicious ones.</p><p>We managed to find that out through the inside help of Eden, who also belongs to CosPro. The culprits have been kept in custody and should be in the middle of investigation right now.</p><p>I’m terribly sorry for the mess. Today might be difficult but maybe… by the start of a new year, all truths will come to light.</p><p>I do not know what the result will be. Maybe the records I submitted as proof were mistaken, and my father really committed those crimes.</p><p>And even if his accusations are finally cleared, he won’t come back… After all, my father and I are two different people. I ask that you don’t mistake that, at least.</p><p>Whether my father really turns out to be a wonderful super idol… or the opposite, a fearsome criminal… he’s still a separate individual from me.</p><p>I dreamed to be like my dad. I loved him. But I’m not his copy. I’ve lived until this day as myself, as Akehoshi Subaru.</p><p>Many life experiences and my meeting with my teammates brought me to the grand stage that is SS.</p><p>And there’s been nothing shameful in the life I’ve lived and the story I’ve weaved until today.</p><p>I have not committed crimes or any illegal actions. I gave it my all and worked hard, forming bonds with my surrounding people, piling one victory after another, until I finally arrived here.</p><p>If you can’t believe me. If you think I must’ve taken disgraceful methods because I’m the son of a criminal… then you can study me up as you like.</p><p>I’ll always prove my innocence. I won’t run away or hide.</p><p>So, please, if you can find it to forgive me… allow me to sing in front of you with a smile from the heart.</p><p>Please let me stay an idol.</p><p>Please.</p><p>…</p><p>…That’s the end of the dark and heavy talk.</p><p>Can I lighten up the mood with a song here?</p><p>Okay… Right.

And I probably will continue to, for life.</p><p>…Like a philosopher. Like a believer. I’ll keep on pondering, until I die.</p><p>…Ibara will ponder the rest of the difficult things for me anyway.</p><p>…Hiyori-kun will tell me what to do when I’m about to cause trouble for someone.</p><p>…Jun is relatable somehow, and when I’m with him, it’s like I’m looking at my reflection in the mirror, which is a help.</p><p>…I’m not dissatisfied in any way. That makes me feel a little bad, even.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I see. You have it so nice, Nagisa-san. You’re so simple and pure. I envy you.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…That might be the first time someone told me that they envy me.</p><p>…Thank you. For not calling me pitiful.</p><p>…Subaru-kun. I said that your father and mine resemble each other.</p><p>…But let me amend that. Your father was what mine could’ve been if he never made a mistake.</p><p>…Or is it the opposite? I don’t know. But, your father never did anything wrong.</p><p>…He diligently taught a strange, creepy child who couldn’t even smile well how to sing.</p><p>…He told me many times, that he had a son.</p><p>…That he wanted to be someone his son wouldn’t be ashamed of.</p><p>…That he wanted to stay an idol his son could look up to.</p><p>…So I think that your father stayed an idol of your dreams to the end.</p><p>…If he really had become a successor of my father, taking part or lending a hand in any of his wrongdoings――</p><p>…Then he should’ve received my father’s protection. He wouldn’t have been broken apart like that.</p><p>…My father was a truly terrible villain, but his crimes were never exposed, even after his death.</p><p>…He never got arrested. He was a careful man, a consummate villain beyond anybody’s grasp, and impenetrable as a god.</p><p>…If your father was really another such villain, he wouldn’t have met such an unfortunate end.</p><p>…I think that he must have fallen into the trap of someone that’s not my father… an opposing power.</p><p>…My father was hard to catch, and that’s why those people placed their aim at his favorite super idol instead.</p><p>…And then by associating my father’s past crimes with him, they must’ve planned to lure my father into a trap, to finally catch him.</p><p>…That plan amounted to nothing in the end as my father lived out his days tranquilly.</p><p>…But he couldn’t protect your father. I think my father regretted that to the end.</p><p>…Supposedly, he offered his help time and time, but your father rejected all of it.</p><p>…He remained sublime and honorable to the end, never tainted by evil.”</p><h3 id="7-3">/ 7</h3><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…However. As a result, your dad was swallowed by the spiral of malice, and you and your mother had to walk the path of hardships.</p><p>…I don’t know if his choice was correct. Maybe some would laugh and say he’s a stupid fool.</p><p>…But me, I think he’s really cool.</p><p>…It may just happen to go this way but… in the end, you rose above all those hardships and darkness, and arrived to shine here at the center of everything.</p><p>…I think we were all saved, that you are a strong and just child; a good child. Me, Father, and perhaps your father.</p><p>…There have been sacrifices made, so I can’t say this is a truly happy ending.</p><p>…But it’s much better than the completely unsalvageable despair it could’ve been.</p><p>…You’ve worked so hard, Subaru-kun.</p><p>…Today you’re shining just as much as your father once was, or perhaps even more nobly so.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Thank you.</p><p>I’m happy you’re telling me so much even though you’re probably not much of a talker, Nagisa-san. There’s more or less a good half I can’t say I understand, but I’m feeling lighter.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Humans cannot understand one another. But that doesn’t mean nothing is conveyed in communication.</p><p>…For example, it’s possible to know how one feels through song.</p><p>…We’ve weaved history by causing many of such miracles in this world forsaken by God.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You always immediately talk about history, Nagisa-san.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I like it. The workings of humanity, tracing their roots and branches. They interest me.</p><p>…Is it weird?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nuh-huh. It’s good to have something you like.</p><p>…Ow―whoops. No good; I can’t stand straight!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…A-Are you really okay? Should I lend you my shoulder?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ah. Leave that to us.</p><p>You okay, Subaru~? Today must’ve been hard on you. There, there~ You did well.</p><p>All’s left is to see the fruits of our effort. Laugh or cry, it’s gonna be the end.</p><p>Whether we win or lose, we’ll be going home after this. Then it’s just waiting for the new year to dawn while slurping soba on a kotatsu.</p><p>Good work this year. Wasn’t it so fun and fulfilling?”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…You still look to have some stamina left. Have you grown tougher, Ma… Maa-kun?</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ah. Anything but that nickname. Isara Mao, please.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Right. I’ll remember.</p><p>…I once said that anyone could replace you.</p><p>…And that opinion hasn’t changed much even now.</p><p>…But I suppose you must be an invaluable, irreplaceable, important presence to your friends in Trickstar.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. That doesn’t apply to just me. Most people are special, irreplaceable ‘only one’s to someone else in the world.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…You’re right. Thank you; I’ve gained another wisdom. No… I could finally understand.</p><p>…Fufu. It’s so fun to be alive.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ahaha, that goes without saying, Nagisa-kun.</p><p>Well, it’s only been a few years since you’ve started adapting to society… so it can’t be helped that you’re practically a toddler. You have plenty of time to learn♪</p><p>I shall continue to teach you so many fun things! With love, of course♪”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Yes. Thank you for always, Hiyori-kun.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Haha. You’ve been chatting like it’s all over, but the result is taking time to show, huh?</p><p>Wonder what’s wrong. Maybe technical troubles?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Nn~… Some of the staffs must’ve been involved in that streaming and got captured, so they’re likely lacking in people.</p><p>Or, it’s possible that it’s a <em>veery</em> close match and they’re being careful by recalculating so they won’t make a mistake. I think it was an intense match too~♪”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Tch… It would’ve been <em>our</em> easy victory had our inside people not interfered. It’s beyond frustrating; I should’ve removed all the pus before they festered.</p><p>I shall reflect upon this seriously to better my next endeavors.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right. Let’s both get even stronger and fight again next year. I hope we can have a straightforward match next time, without any of these silly schemes.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. Eden’s battle power might plummet since the two third years will have graduated next year. It might become our easy victory♪”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Then I have bad news for you! In our school, we’re not bound by our academic year since we’re contracted directly to CosPro!</p><p>Even after His Excellency and His Royal Highness graduated, they will still thrive as Eden as long as there isn’t some big change~ Isn’t that right, you two?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yup, I still have many things to teach to Jun-kun, after all!</p><p>We are staying in the school dorms right now, so we will still need to move out. But as idols, we’re forever Eden!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “To be honest, I want you out real fast since your personal properties take out most of the space in our dorm room…</p><p>It’ll be so great to be rid of you and only meet you for work, huh~?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Eh~? Still so dishonest! Jun-kun, you meanie…!”</p><h3 id="8-3">/ 8</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Oh? Quiet, everyone. There goes the drum roll; I think they’re ready to announce the result.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ohh, finally huh. Ugh~… These times always feel deadly nerve-wracking to me.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. But there’s no thrill to knowing the result from the start, right? Isn’t it exciting, to not know whether you’ll win or lose?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You’re surprisingly a gambler, aren’t you, Ukki~?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Didn’t you guys hear when I said ‘quiet’? Or do you guys can’t stay still for even a few minutes?</p><p>Well… Fufu, it’s nice that I get to scold you like usual, like this. I’m glad we can return to our usual selves at the very end.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yep. To the usual Trickstar, right?</p><p>Let’s see, what’s the result gonna be…?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, suddenly I’m scared! Guys, can we hold hands?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ehh!? I was all happy thinking you’ve grown dependable, so do you really need to go back to being all jittery at the end, Makoto!? Well, I don’t mind―there. Holding hands, right?”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/xs5MeuR.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Akehoshi, you can hold onto me since you seem to have a hard time standing straight. Do it naturally.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “O-Okay. I can’t make the audience worry, right?</p><p><em>Gyuuu</em>~… Gee, this is scary. What should I do if we lose? It’ll be my fault.”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/3NsKLnc.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t say such things. It’ll be alright, because… our Goddess of Victory is always smiling upon us.</p><p>Look. Anzu is smiling.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…Eek!?</p><p>That surprised me! The spotlight shone on us suddenly, so I thought Anzu radiated some mysterious ray of light as she smiled…!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “What would that make Anzu-chan? Anyway, this is…?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah… if it’s like the DreamFes system, then the spotlight shines down on the winner.</p><p>That means… ahh, so we won.</p><p>We won SS.</p><p>I-I can’t find the words… I can’t think straight either. What is this? I’m so happy.</p><p>I’m <em>so</em> happy! We did it! We won!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ah… Finally. Felt so long. Ahaha, it’s really hard to find the words once push comes to shove. The tension is completely gone from my shoulders.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah, same… Yeah. Ahh, I’m so glad♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Tch~ Congratulations.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “For real? &lt;GODDAMN&gt;! How can we lose after coming this far? This is frustrating~! Damn you and congratulations…!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I think that you can congratulate them even while frustrated is commendable, or rather… you’re a good boy, Jun.</p><p>…Congratulations. This wasn’t in the script, so I don’t know what would be a good line for the occasion.</p><p>…But I’m relieved.</p><p>…Those who are right are rewarded. The ones who achieve are those who worked for it. I think that should stay the law of the world.</p><p>…There is no meaning in victory and defeat. But there’s value to your victory today.</p><p>…I hope for you to keep walking towards the brilliant future, without repeating that past of gloom.</p><p>…Fufu. A pity, is it, Ibara?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Nn, well it’s fine, I guess~… I can’t stomach that it’s the foolishness of our top people that dragged us down and caused this defeat, not the fault in my plan.</p><p>Well, not being able to see that coming was still my negligence.</p><p>It’s good enough harvest. We’ll be learning from this loss, and win next time for sure. Go ahead and laugh all you want for now, Trickstar.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Can’t you even congratulate them openly? …Anyway, you kids; don’t stand around stupefied like that.</p><p>SS might be atypical in many ways, but if it still adheres to the rules of the DreamFest system… then the winners gain the right to sing an encore.</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/ZCpVWSO.jpg"></p><p>Sing. With your all, since it’s the end. After this is the new year break, so… there’s no need for holding back♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yes! Alright, we’re singing, guys! This time we <em>did</em> anticipate an encore and practice for it in advance! Anzu, play the music!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup, put on our usual song!</p><p>Ya~y, are you watching us, everyone? We’ve won~♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Haha, sounds like a joke, doesn’t it? But it’s real; we’ve really won…♪”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/mhs6cWj.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ahh, I want to hurry and sing! The wait feels like forever!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Wha―wait, don’t swing me around like that, Hokke… The music’s not gonna play any sooner even if you shake me! Stay, stay!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ahaha, sorry! But I can’t wait! It’s the moment I’ve always dreamed for!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Fufu. That’s okay, I guess~ This hectic feel is just like us.</p><p>Ahh… We’ve grown since DDD and that S1 in spring, haven’t we? Totally ready to sing the encore and all♪</p><p>I’m gonna sing with a wide smile at the end too! &lt;ONLY YOUR STARS!&gt;…☆”</p><p>【Sing along us, everyone!
