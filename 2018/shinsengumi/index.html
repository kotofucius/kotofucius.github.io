data-src="https://i.imgur.com/EPTLGVF.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “<em>Mikejima, Madara?</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>…Who’s that? What a weird name! I <em>think</em> I might’ve heard of him before, but–any idea, Hokke?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t call people’s name weird; I agree it has an unsettling ring to it though.</p><p>&lt;Murderer&gt;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>… Mikejima, Madara?</p><p>Didn’t he come up in rumors a lot last year?</p><p>It’s said he’s someone of the same level of talents as the Five Oddballs, or something… Sometimes there’d be a ruckus over him just as everyone’s starting to forget.</p><p>I thought he’s something in the vein of a school ghost story or urban legend, to be honest.</p><p>I had no interest so I don’t know much, but rumors of him that reached my ears were mostly ridiculous in nature.</p><p>Also, this is my vague recollection too, but wasn’t he supposed to have transferred somewhere?</p><p>No, not transfer; made an exchange student for one of Yumenosaki’s sister schools overseas…?</p><p>Sorry that my memories sound faint, Transfer student. I don’t like to remember it, so I tend to put a lid on my memories of last year.</p><p>Well, that aside. What’s wrong with this Mikejima Madara?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Uh-huh… So you met with that Mikejima Madara guy huh, Transfer student? In spring, sometime after you met us… in Yumenosaki Academy?</p><p>And for some reason, the guy keeps insisting he’s your childhood friend?</p><p>Huh… And here I thought we managed to become your first friends in Yumenosaki~</p><p>…Eh? Transfer student, you have no recollection of it either? Just a vague feeling that you <em>might</em> or <em>might not</em> know someone like him?</p><p>So does that mean he might’ve misunderstood?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… and yet for it to be a misunderstanding, this Mikejima seems to know an awful lot about your childhood–is that right, Transfer student?</p><p>It doesn’t sound at all to you like he got the wrong person, misunderstood, or just making stuffs up?</p><p>That sure sounds bizarre. I see, of course you’d be curious if someone like that suddenly showed up before you. Who’s this Mikejima Madara guy, really?</p><p>This is fishy… Transfer student, has he done anything to you?</p><p>No, just the crime of making you uneasy is deserving of a thousand deaths. Your enemy is our enemy.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yep, yep! Let’s go find him and give him a good beating☆”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Excuse me for intervening, but are you all investigating about Mikejima-dono?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hm? Do you know anything, Kanzaki?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Not enough to say with confidence that I do, unfortunately. We merely happen to be acquainted, as we worked together in Wisteria Festival.</p><p>I heard you mouthing some extreme things, but…</p><p>That man appears to be just another student at our school. If there is anything you’d like to know, would it not be better to visit him and ask directly?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “True. Honestly, probing in secret from a distance isn’t very like us.</p><p>Now that it’s decided, let’s go to the third year classroom.</p><p>At around this hour, all classrooms should have just finished class; I think we can catch that Mikejima guy if we make haste.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. Since we’re all the same age here in Trickstar, we don’t get much chance to visit the third year classrooms. I’m nervous~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Where did you learn to be nervous, Akehoshi?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Ah, no–halt, you two.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hm? Don’t stop us, Kanzaki. When we come up with a thought, we immediately put it into action–that’s our style.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “And that is imprudent, I tell you. Look, Transfer student-dono seems hesitant to make you go that far.</p><p>You said it is for her sake, but your good intent would backfire if you end up giving her more trouble.</p><p>It isn’t something <em>I</em> can chide others for, admittedly.</p><p>Anyway. It appears there is no need to visit Mikejima-dono yourselves. Can you hear those footsteps, that sound like they would shake even mountains?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Footsteps…?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/4As0rIp.jpg"></p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! Excuse meeeeee☆</p><p>[Three cheers]! As I thought, you’re still in the classroom, Anzu-san! It’s Mama~ I’m so happy to see you look so lively again today!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Mama…?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Oooh! Are those Akehoshi Subaru-san and Hidaka Hokuto-san over there? Trickstar!</p><p>I’ve heard of your achievemeents! Thanks for caring after my dear little daughteer♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “? Daughter…?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Yup, Anzu-san is my most cherished love in the world…☆</p><p>Can I borrow her for a minute? I have some things to dicuuss!</p><p>It’s a pressing matter, so I’ll be hauling her without waiting for answers! Here we gooo☆</p><p>Now, let’s depart, Anzu-san! Word has it that haste makes waste, but why should that matter when Earth and the universe are in constant haste!</p><p>Wouldn’t that mean ‘standing in place’ and ‘running’ are both the same things in the eend?</p><p>Running fool and standing fool; all fools, so let’s run<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>! [All things are in a state of flux]! Let’s go ‘round and ‘round, Anzu-san!</p><p>Hold hands with Mama for one trip around the earth! Hahahahahaha…☆”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/1r8VRWC.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto</strong> &amp; <strong>Subaru:</strong> “…?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Ah~ <em>Ahem</em>. Gentlemen, I do not believe this is time to stand petrified.</p><p>I have seen this before, so I know… Transfer student-dono was just abducted before your very eyes.</p><p>You should hurry and run after him. Mikejima-dono is a man beyond imagination; there is no telling what he might pull.”</p><hr><h2 id="before-the-dawn">Before the Dawn</h2><h3 id="part-1">Part 1</h3><p><strong>&gt; Corridor</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/cbckJnR.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Stop right there~! Give the transfer student back, <em>Mikejima Madara</em>!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! No one is ever foolish enough to stop when shouted, and only goody-two-shoes obediently give back something when asked!</p><p>That wouldn’t be interesting, would it Trickstar…☆</p><p>I think you guys can understand me, seeing as you’re still children and still so eager to play around! Festival, it’s a festivaaal! Let’s have fun!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Drat it, stop spouting cryptics! Seriously, what’s wrong with you!? What are you planning to do to the transfer student… Mikejima Madara!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! [Out of the question]! Also, I hope you’ll stop calling me Mikejima Madara and just go with the short version ‘Mama’♪</p><p>…Whoopsie? Stop struggling, Anzu-san! It makes you hard to carry!</p><p>Hahaha! You tomboy, what’s wroong? I’m not sure, but are you trying to tell me to not get Trickstar involveed?</p><p>They must be truly precious to you as comraades♪ Splendid, splendid! That’s exactly why my action has meaning!”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “That’s as far as you go! Gentlemen, this really should go without saying, but… Do not run in the hallway!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Ohh? Great going, Souma-san. Did you take a shortcut?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Hmph… Adonisu-dono once taught me the basics of hunting. It is standard practise to study the pattern of the prey and lie in ambush, instead of pursuing normally.</p><p>Surrender and let yourself be caught, ruffian!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! Anachronistic as everr! I don’t dislike thaat!</p><p>But too naive! You don’t <em>find</em> your path, see–you <em>make</em> it!</p><p>It wouldn’t be interesting to get caught here, so I’ll have you stick with my game a bit longer!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hm? Mikejima Madara, what are you trying to do? Opening the window… No, don’t tell me!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “No tells or tics! It’s exactly as you’ve guessed, Hokuto-san!</p><p>Close your mouth, Anzu-san; you might end up biting your tongue if you don’t… <em>Whooooooshaaaaaa</em>!☆”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Uhya!? He jumped! Hey, this is the second floor!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ohh, that man skilfully held onto a tree branch with his empty hand while carrying the transfer student with the other!</p><p>And he just swung down to the ground with no problem whatsoever!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ooh! That’s some really great acrobatics for someone so massive! Alright then, I’ll also…☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Wait a minute. You’ll hurt yourself; let’s just use the stairs and go after him normally.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ehh~? We’ll lose him that way~ Hokke, you coward!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Call me whatever, I can’t get you injured here. I believe the transfer student would agree.</p><p>Just listen to me and stop moping around. We’re going to the first floor! Start running, and fast!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…OK, Hokke. This really isn’t time to argue.</p><p>Let’s get moving! Wait for it, <em>Mikejima Madara</em>~!

Naturally, I intend to rescue Transfer student-dono from this dilemma.</p><p>However, I do not think it smart to let the blood get to my head and join the chase, the way <em>Torikkusutaa</em> do it.</p><p>It would lead to the same conclusion as when I met Mikejima-dono for the first time, right before Wisteria Festival.</p><p>And repeating the same conclusion means there is no growth. Attacking from the rear gate is not to my taste, but… I should go to the student council office and plead for Hasumi-dono’s assistance.</p><p>I can borrow troops from the student council, and Hasumi-dono might know of Mikejima-dono’s goal. Clear the decks, tear down the fort, and strip the enemy bare.</p><p>You cannot win the war by being daredevil. No, simply winning wars will lead us to destruction the same way it led Minamoto-no-Yoshitsune to his. That is what I learned from Wisteria Festival.</p><p>Let us head to the student council office forthwith.)</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “…Uh–hya? Awawa!?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Oh?

Forgive me, I did not mean to surprise you.</p><p>Ah, were you carrying these books? They have been scattered on the floor. Allow me to pick them up.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Wah, no need to go through the trouble! You seemed to be in a hurry anyway, so please prioritize your own goal~♪”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “No, that would be impertinent of me. They are just books; picking them up will not take time. Please wait for a minute.</p><p>…Hm?

I don’t personally hold any interest in them, but I’ve been asked by someone to research about this matter…</p><p>I’d love to see that letter if possible.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Hm. That is not a problem, but apparently the content is not of any particular importance. And a large part of the letter got burnt during the air raid…</p><p>Well, just asking my father is of little problem.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ah, then please ask him for me!</p><p>Most records of the Shinsengumi are dramatizations, so I’ve been troubled by the lack of trustworthy materials~</p><p>Well, it’s the exaggerated, made-up image that sells with the fans… so it’s not like there’s any problem, actually.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Hmm… I do not entirely understand, but… I am done picking up the books.

I’m fine already, so please go ahead~”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Yes… I shall excuse myself, Aoba-dono.

Gross.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/UQN9E5S.jpg"></p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Hmph. Whose fault do you think it is that I’m so tired right now, Eichi?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Implying it’s <em>mine</em>? I’m properly cleaning after the mess of DDD–of Trickstar’s revolution–with you like this.</p><p>And anyway. If it’s you Keito, you should know it’s all thanks to me that things could settle with <em>only</em> this much trouble.</p><p>An even more destructive future was possible, and the old me would’ve weighed that choice more.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…So what changed your mind?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “A glimpse to a dream… I’m no different from all the other students in this academy.</p><p>In order to realize that dream, it’s necessary to pick up the pieces, even if it’s too much trouble. Fortunately, at the rate we’re going, I see this ending sooner than expected.</p><p>Isn’t it so thrilling, Keito? Everything will finally begin from now on… definitely.</p><p>Let’s caress and raise it with love: the flower that shouldn’t have bloomed. And then we’ll show it off to the sick and tired masses—</p><p>What idols are like.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I know. That’s the student council’s purpose, and our dream… isn’t it, Eichi?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Your dream and mine differ just slightly, but they’re heading towards the same direction, so I think we can still walk hand-in-hand. Well, let’s both believe that for now.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Excuse me.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Oh. Welcome, Kanzaki-kun… was it? Despite not being part of the student council, you’ve been showing up here almost daily lately.</p><p>You’ve been great help by doing the minute errands for us.</p><p>To wipe off the image that we the student council are tyrants, oppressors… we need to take the troublesome matters into our own hands, without throwing them at those below us.</p><p>But you’re one of Keito’s people, so there’s little problem with slaving you away, right?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Yes. I intend to make my best efforts for Hasumi-dono’s sake. Feel free to ask anything of me; I will do anything, from pouring tea to taking care of documents.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…Eichi. Don’t talk to our Kanzaki. You’ll taint him.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Meanie. I won’t try anything; I just want you to share your toys with me.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Don’t treat human beings like toys.</p><p>…Anyway, Kanzaki. You’re a little later than usual. Did something happen, or did class just happen to go on for longer?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Nothing appears to escape you, Hasumi-dono. Well, you see, it happens that… (<em>explains</em>) …and it is tying all of us in knots.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Hmm? Mikejima… abducted the transfer student? I-Is everything alright?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Wow, sounds super interesting… As tricky as ever, that Mikejima-kun; he never stops being such a troublemaker.</p><p>To do that to one of my dear students–in other words, to steal away my possession like that!</p><p>It’s an unforgivable crime. Keito, let’s form a punitive force. All this time, I’ve thought of Mikejima-kun as an eyesore; there’s no chance like now to catch him and sentence him to a death by boiling♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Don’t start crafting disturbing plans just because you’re bored. You’ve lost interest in the paperwork huh, Eichi?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I mean, isn’t this one of those mundanities that should be abbreviated? A waste of time and little else.</p><p>These are all materials to persuade those people with mold growing for brains–those big-shots who have gotten too old for their own good–to nod their head, right?</p><p>Come modernization and we’ll have machines taking care of these stuffs within the count of seconds. They’re more suitable for the job anyway; as human beings with knowledge, our place is somewhere else.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I think differently. Machines can’t do anything beyond what’s programmed; but creative fields need the ‘waste’ and ‘playing around’ only humans can do.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Hmm… I guess we’re still in a planet of apes. We probably need three more Einsteins to advance the era a step further.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…Ah, sorry. We’ve strayed from the topic, no thanks to Eichi’s interjections.</p><p>Kanzaki. I’ll give you all the personnels you need, so take command and investigate what Mikejima is trying to play at.</p><p>He did cause a similar mess before, so well, the circumstances this time are likely no different.</p><p>But <em>just in case</em>, anyway. Trickstar and the transfer student, they’re currently key people who can turn the academy’s peace upside down.</p><p>We can’t make the mistake of letting Mikejima break them.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “On the other hand, it’ll help a lot if Trickstar would just break Mikejima-kun to pieces, considering how dangerous and ungovernable he is.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I don’t think we can expect that much. Trickstar are practically toddlers still learning how to crawl at this point. Though sure, they’re a very fascinating bomb that might as well has the explosive power to wipe out everything.</p><p>That’s why we need to take extra caution when dealing with them.</p><p>Don’t forget the severe damage we had to take once due to failing to rein Mikejima in.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. When you put it like that, Trickstar and Mikejima-kun are quite similar in type. Bombs, huh…</p><p>But of course we still need to think of a way to utilize them to the fullest, instead of letting them gather dust?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I’m against it. Ultimate weapons cause great damage when actually utilized.</p><p>The smart thing is to find a way to get the effects we want from the weapon, but without actually using it.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Ideals again? You’re always like that, Keito. But well, I guess to pursue one’s ideals as long as it is possible is what it means to be human…</p><p>We still can’t forget a backup plan, though.</p><p>Now why don’t we remove the bombs and landmines one by one, and transform what was once a battleground into a field of flowers?”</p><h3 id="part-3">Part 3</h3><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/C3905Zs.jpg"></p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Please excuse me~♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…Aoba.

You’re as excellent as ever.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “No no, I’m having a tough time with that…</p><p>I <em>think</em> I’ve gathered a good amount of materials, but I’m a little concerned if I’m on the right track?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “What’s this about? Tsumu… Aoba-kun, is Keito slaving you away? Oh no, that’s not good at all; if you don’t like something, you need to speak up about it.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “I don’t dislike it~ I think gathering data like this is pretty fun.</p><p>Keito-kun helps me out sometimes, just for being a former Library Committee member. I’m happy to return the favor.</p><p>Honestly, if we’re talking dislikes… being called ‘Aoba-kun’ by you feels lonely, so if possible, please call me Tsumugi like the old times… Eichi-kun♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Hahaha, talk about sarcasm backfiring, Eichi.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “…(<em>kicks Keito under the desk</em>).”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Cut it, you’re such a brat sometimes…</p><p>Anyway, you said you were concerned about being on the wrong track? Can you explain specifically, what you mean by that?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Of course. Umm, so I’ve been gathering records of the Shinsengumi, like you asked, but surprisingly so much of them are lies and truths blended together.</p><p>With the fabrications practically overrunning the facts, at that.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Well, it’s the Shinsengumi. The Japanese have always loved their tragic fools.</p><p>Though we’re benefitting from the masses’ fondness of underdogs too, so we can’t make fun of it.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Right~ The old <em>fine</em> was sort of like that, after all.</p><p>We embodied, represented the sufferings of the weak who felt they were inferior and abused. That’s how we gathered favor.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Stop chiming in, Eichi, you’re complicating things. <em>I’m</em> talking to Aoba.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “…Tch. Fine, have your way. The third wheel will back off and go pour some tea.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ah, that’s not necessary. I’ll leave once I’m done confirming the direction of the task. I don’t intend to interrupt you two at work.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You’re not interrupting anything. Eichi was willing to work for once, so we’re mostly done here.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Somehow Tsumugi manages to only ever visit at days like these… How ill-timed. I feel once more that I’m not the main character of a story anymore.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. I think it’s main character-like though, the way events are set off even during your normal days.</p><p>And didn’t I say before? Everyone is the main character of their own story.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “From a more global view, the opinion that everyone is a main character is misguided, though.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “As I said, stop butting in, Eichi. Now the talk’s wandered off the point…</p><p>To the subject at hand. So you’re concerned whether to be faithful to facts or not.</p><p>My verdict is that there’s no need to stick to facts. Folklores, hearsays, fictions, exaggerations, fabrications…</p><p>I’ll take anything, so gather all the materials on Shinsengumi that you can find.</p><p>Right now, I know too little. That’s exactly why I need you to gather records for me.</p><p>Whether to go for fictional or realism comes later, <em>after</em> learning about them.</p><p>At least I thought that was the best approach, and I seem to be right…</p><p>How I see it, it seems we’ll inevitably have to go for the fictional portrayal, but that doesn’t mean I don’t need materials that are true-to-life and detailed.</p><p>You need to know the truths to tell untruths, and you need to first understand the foundations to make modifications.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Show-off…</p><p>Why are you researching about the Shinsengumi anyway, Keito? Since it really screams Japanese, is it for Akatsuki’s next show?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “No, it’s for a personal matter. One of the parishioners to our temple – an especially powerful and influential household among them all – requested…</p><p>…that we enliven the region using Shinsengumi as the theme.</p><p>Apparently my parents talked about me being an idol to that parishioner, during a funeral or a meeting…</p><p>‘<em>Then you should be good at this, right?</em>’ said them, and here I am dealing with their presumption.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Huh, calling idols over for a regional development project…? That’s pretty old-fashioned thinking. We’re not at an era of bubble economy anymore.</p><p>An era where numerable super idols shone intensely like the sun and every countryman knew of their names, that’s a thing of the past—</p><p>If this were the old times, calling idols over might have some effect, even if momentary.</p><p>Yes, if this <em>were</em> that era where everyone recognized and loved idols, who possessed the prestige and magnetism of a monotheistic cult god.</p><p>But with the advancement of media, people’s tastes have become split. Now there are so many idols everywhere, more than what you know to do with…</p><p>I don’t think they can expect such a big effect on their economy.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “That’s what put me in a tight spot. Even if I show up and sing, nothing much would happen. I wouldn’t be achieving what they expected from me.</p><p>And as a family running a temple, that will be trouble. It’s a parishioner; I prefer to fulfill their request, anyway I can.</p><p>The temple still has my brother, but that doesn’t change the fact I’m causing my parents and the whole temple troubles by coming down from the mountain to become an idol.</p><p>I want to fulfill my duties, at least. That’s why I’ve been researching about Shinsengumi to come up with a plan.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “That’s just like you, Keito. You pretend to be ruthless, yet you can never seem to abandon anything.</p><p>…If you just wish for it, I can have a little chat with the bigwigs of that area and settle it for you. It’ll be easy, and there won’t be any need to spend money or energy.</p><p>I’m sure they’ll be glad to be served the chance to suck up to Tenshouin Zaibatsu.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “And do you think I wish for that, Eichi?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Nope, not at all. …Ever the devoted monk, Keito.</p><p>…Oops. Sorry for interrupting the talk despite being an unrelated party, you two. I just remembered I have something to attend to, so I’ll be excusing myself.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Stop right there. Aren’t you scheming something, Eichi? Your face tells it all. I’m asking you just <em>don’t</em> stick your neck into this; it’s my problem.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Well, true. But that doesn’t mean the problem is only yours, right?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…?”</p><h3 id="part-4">Part 4</h3><p><strong>&gt; Sports grounds</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/lHncqtg.jpg"></p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “…Mm-hmm.</p><p>Understood.

Now I can relax.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Tch~… While being careful not to say I yield, I was trying to catch you off-guard and do a surprise attack, you knoow?</p><p>I thought that would decide the match, but to think you would take me down like noothing?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “That’s how a brawl is; it’s not the end until your opponent has been either rendered completely powerless, or made to admit defeat. Wasn’t that what you wanted, Mikejima? A brawl?</p><p>I kept ya company. So how’s it feel? Satisfied?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Of course! [Thank you for the patronage]! I’m content and full! That was sooo fun. I haven’t had anyone to compete seriously against lately, you seee!</p><p>But if I don’t do it seriously once in a while, I won’t know my limiits!</p><p>And then I might end up causing disasters by brandishing a little too much power towards those not my level!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. Well, an elephant playing around with a little puppy will inevitably end up crushing it underfoot. I get that.</p><p>Anyway, I did put the brakes on, but you’re not hurt anywhere, are ya? I have a first aid kit so I can treat you if you really need it.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! That was putting the brakes oon? The summit of the mountain is a high and faraway place indeed!</p><p>On a path less traveled you’ll find a mountain of flowers<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>! That was such a fulfilling climbb!</p><p>[Exhilarating]! If it’s fine with you, let’s play again… Kurou-san♪”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Nope. I can win this time due to the gap in experience, but give it three more rounds and the winner between us will become hard to predict.</p><p>Meaning I <em>might</em> lose. Be as I am, I have my pride, y’know. I’ll be bummed out for real if I lose at handcrafts or karate, so spare me the thought.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! But that’s exactly why this has meaning! It is by tasting the pain of defeat that men may conquer it and mature! Let’s advance the path of evolution together… Kurou-san!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You sure talk a bunch. Wanna take another punch? Haa?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Scary, scary! Should you really whip the loser furtheer? What was that you said about not wanting to bully the weak? Hahaha! Or will you take back those woords?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You really won’t shut that mouth, will ya… I’m starting to consider stopping your breath once and for all to spare myself from any annoyance down the line.”</p><h3 id="part-6">Part 6</h3><p><strong>&gt; Garden Terrace</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/OBROX1j.jpg"></p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Now, everyone! Kiryuu-dono and I have cooked some treats, so have them as you will!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. Thought there should be something to nibble at between our lil’ chat, but the snacks ended up being more intricate than I meant it… Sorry for the wait, kids.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’ll have some.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh yay! Don’t mind us digging in, then~☆”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! [A good wife and a wise mother]! You really are skillful with your fingers huh, Kurou-san? So you know your stuffs even with making sweets♪”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haa? Some old-school values you live by there.</p><p>At our place, our dad’s too busy with work to cook and stuff, y’see. So I cook my own meal everyday.</p><p>C’mon, go ahead and dig in. They prolly don’t look too pretty, but they’re not inedible.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “The modesty! These are impressive! You continue to surprise me, Kiryuu-dono; you are still way ahead of me in too many fields♪”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You’ll surpass me in no time. It’s the guys who persist on with diligence and honesty who wind up the strongest.</p><p>Anyway, you gotta stop loitering and take a seat, Kanzaki.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Will do, once I am done giving tea to everyone…”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Zaki-saaan, the seat next to me is empty! Sit here, here☆”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Fufu. <em>Torikkusutaa</em>, I see you are keeping Transfer student-dono guarded from both sides.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah, just in case. …So we’ll be fast to move on the guard this time, if Mikejima Madara were to try anything on the transfer student again.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. Kanzaki, I thought you might not fit in class with your quirks… but you’re getting along just fine, shockingly enough. Good, good.</p><p>Anyway, I’ll put our discussion on track since it’s gotten all jumbled; that’s what we’re opening a round table here for.</p><p>Might be inevitable when Mikejima’s involved, but seriously, I’ve had it with being played around.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Oh? I’m offended that you talk like the fault’s all on mee! Hahaha☆”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Stop laughing and learn to show some remorse, you dumbass. Ya think it’s okay to cause a problem for your underclassmen? We make our juniors uneasy when we don’t hold ourselves together as upperclassmen, y’know.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Ow-ow-ouch!? Don’t wristlock me like that! You’re dislocating my joooints! It’s alright, Kurou-san, I feel sorry about it like I should, okaaay…!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Uh. Kiryuu-senpai, so you’re good friends with Mikejima… senpai?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Nah, more than acquaintances but less than friends I’d say. This guy barely comes to school so I dunno much about him, to be honest…</p><p>We did clash quite a few times last year.</p><p>But it ain’t as easy as how it goes in manga. You don’t automatically become friends after fighting.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Right! We don’t know each other that well, but I’ve always had interest in him! So I was thinking to have Kurou-san carry the <em>mikoshi</em> with me this time!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “That carrying the <em>mikoshi</em> stuff I don’t get. Is that an expression? I’m not the witty type, so put it in plain words that I can understand.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! We’re not quite at that stage, yeeet♪</p><p>…Ow-ow-ouch!? Like I said, please spare me the joint locks, Kurou-san!</p><p>It’s not me being unnecessarily cryptic! The specifics really haven’t been decideed!</p><p>I’ve done works by gathering people to form a team with like this, many times before.</p><p>That’s how I work as MaM. I’ve frequently held stuffs like the Wisteria Festival that Souma-san also participated in.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Yes, that was a valuable experience, but…</p><p>Mikejima-dono, do you abduct other students to be forced to join you and cause this kind of ruckus each time?</p><p>Hasumi-dono is distressed, if you must know. Do refrain from adding onto that person’s burdens.</p><p>Rather than recruiting teammates each time a work comes to you, would it not be better to form a unit normally?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. Achieving results without forming a unit shatters the very foundation of the unit system, you see.</p><p>It’s a method those people once called the Five Oddballs had avoided, due to their wish for peace. And that’s my revolution.</p><p>Apparently a certain group have been barking about revolution and all, but in the end they’re just swallowed into the system…</p><p>So only that Switch unit and I are left to present other possibilities.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? Hokke, isn’t he like, picking a fight with us?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Destruction and revolution are two different things. To defy and destroy everything you’ve laid your eyes on is pure violence.</p><p>To transform the mentality of the masses by triumphing over the student council, and aim for a better future together—</p><p>That’s our revolution.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hmm, so you changed them and that’s it? You just leave them bee?</p><p>Becoming a hero comes with duties; and are you guys properly fulfilling yoours? Let’s give it a thought, don’t we!</p><p>You pulled a revolution. You gained the right to change everything. Yet you neglect that right, playing around excitedly without a care…</p><p>Just like the Five Oddballs once did.</p><p>In the end, Eichi-san and Keito-san weren’t excused from their positions, still supplementing for what’s missing behind and on the stage…</p><p>And thanks to that, you’ve had the good luck of the whole thing not falling apart and heading to a good direction.</p><p>But let me ask: What was it that you managed to accomplish? Was it just challenging the student council, and destroying the stronghold they’ve built?</p><p>Not a politician or even a philosopher… A mere bomb like you won’t leave a name in history.</p><p>As you are now, you’ll simply be recorded as such a ‘phenomenon’, an accident…</p><p>And you’ll be forgotten, while the student council who still holds the rights to politics in this land weaves the coming history.</p><p>See? Nothing’s changed. From the outside, whether you guys existed or not wouldn’t matter at aall… Hahaha♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…”</p><h3 id="part-7">Part 7</h3><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/f73Nwbj.jpg"></p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Akehoshi. Hidaka. You too, lil’ miss… Drop the scary face. Mikejima’s just trying to provoke you.</p><p>That’s an understudy of Sakuma for you. Good at taunting and nothing else, eh?</p><p>First, you denounce your opponent, deny everything they’ve done… Once they’re angered and provoked, now you work on guiding their thoughts.</p><p>This is what you’re planning to say next, right… Mikejima?</p><p>‘<em>Help with my work to finally perfect your revolution the way it should be, Trickstar</em>.’ Something along that line?</p><p>It’s a type of negotiation method. Hasumi does it too, though he’s terribly bad at it.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! [A veteran’s wisdom]!</p><p>Things just don’t go my way when an experienced third year’s involveed! This method is really effective against first years who are clueless about the ways of wars though, and most of the second years!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Shut your trap. You poked at people’s weak spot and made children still full of worries anxious. Don’t you dare feel good about it.</p><p>At least restrain yourself, you twit. Man, I just can’t like this.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. I’m a solo uniit. I fight alone, and I’ll play every possible card to win even if I’m on my oown.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Umm…?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! What I said just now were all jokes! Nonsense I spouted as a way of negotiation! A &lt;<em>mama joke</em>&gt;☆</p><p>I didn’t mean any of it – can you think of it that waay?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Joke? I find that hard to believe.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah. It felt really disturbing…”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “It’s my hobby to say disturbing thiings! Though that’s a joke too☆</p><p>To tell the truth, I can’t figure you kids out just from the outsidee…</p><p>It looks to me like you were only swept by the current, led around by the nose, and happened to find victory by luck.</p><p>That’s why I’d like to work together with you once, to grasp your abilities and ideaals. We’ve gotten quite off topic, but this has to do with my current goal tooo.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…And that is?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “A festival. Ah, to speak in your words: a job.</p><p>MaM have built a good reputation after all the works I did. Connections and a fine track record tooo…</p><p>And this time, I’ve been entrusted with a huge job and given the budget to do it.</p><p>But the details haven’t been decided yet, so I thought I should start by gathering comrades.</p><p>I was thinking to invite any kid I could find, anyone; and discuss the details of the job with theem.</p><p>That’s why I picked at Anzu-san and her favorite Trickstar.</p><p>Since I spotted Kurou-san in the middle of our game of tag, I tried to involve him as an afterthought.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I’m an afterthought? Don’t make fool of people too much, Mikejima.</p><p>Ah well, that doesn’t matter. So actually, I had this talk with Kanzaki while we were making snacks… It seems our Hasumi has a case of his own.</p><p>A town revitalization plan using the Shinsengumi or something.</p><p>Mikejima. You have connections and budget, but your job doesn’t have specifics yet and you’re in the middle of gathering teammates.</p><p>And here we have a job with specified details, and at minimum Akatsuki to be the performers.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “…But Hasumi-dono disapproves of us getting involved in this personal matter.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Hey, you’re being distant there. Fussing about the weirdest stuff is his usual bad habit, so we’ve gotta force ourselves in.</p><p>What are we comrades for if we won’t help each other in need?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “O-Of course. Indeed I was thinking to ask your help. Hasumi-dono might not nod to my plea, but Kiryuu-dono should be able to convince him, I thought.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. That guy holds a guilty conscience towards me. He won’t say no if I ask.</p><p>Sure, it doesn’t feel too good since it’s like I’m scaring him into it using his weakness.</p><p>But we’re not doing anything bad here. We just wanna help him since he looks so troubled, right?</p><p>Nothing to feel sorry about. We just gotta be frank and show our sincerity.</p><p>So anyway. Don’t our two problems blend in quite well, Mikejima?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh? What does he mean?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You should understand if you’ve been listening. They can fill in for what each other lacks, and their interests align…</p><p>Discerning that, Kiryuu-senpai is trying to invite Mikejima Madara to collaborate with them.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Heh. Since we’re talking about you here, Mikejima, you should already factor in this possibility, right? Isn’t that why you involved me? Am I wrong?</p><p>You and the strings you pull… You’ve got sharp ears, and like Sakuma, you have wide connections, so info naturally come to you.</p><p>I don’t think Hasumi was trying to hide it anyway, so you’re probably already in the know about his problem.</p><p>…As always, you come up with a bunch of schemes despite looking like a thoughtless fool.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Right, and that’s why I remain unhurt even after the war, huuh…</p><p>It’s only now I realize, that I should’ve dropped all those cunnings and struggled with all my youthful energy back then.</p><p>I’ve missed the opportunity to die… I could’ve done something, and yet I didn’t involve myself in the story. I’ve always regretted that.</p><p>Anyway, there’s no demerit in it for me, so I’m not against teaming up with Akatsuki for this joob.</p><p>But Keito-san wouldn’t like this, would hee?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Even if he starts pouting, I’ll see that I make him say yes.</p><p>He’s a lot smarter than me; he should agree if I explain my reasons.</p><p>First off, he’s good-natured at his core, and he’s weak to pressure.</p><p>Get a crass thug like me to tell him ‘<em>Shut up and obey!</em>’ and no question he’ll nod his head up and down.</p><p>Well, sit tight and expect some good news.

I knew you would react like that, but seriously, the more I hear about it, the better this whole idea sounds.</p><p>The parishioner who tasked you with town revitalization, he’s a bigwig of the region the job Mikejima’s been commissioned with is to be held.</p><p>In other words, if we do the town revitalization with him, we can give benefits to both commissioners and satisfy them.</p><p>This is gonna depend on our fine-tuning too, but we can collaborate as one project without any opposition.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “It bothers me how convenient all of this sounds… is it too crooked to admit this? Geez, I’ve gotten into the habit of suspecting something behind everything.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “That’s not all bad. I mean, saying this to you might be like preaching to the Buddha, but it’s true we don’t only have good people in the world.</p><p>Someone gotta know how to suspect what’s behind the curtains, to stay sharp to the animosity of enemies.</p><p>That’s still too much to expect from our Kanzaki, the Trickstar brats, and the transfer student lil’ miss.</p><p>More like, I hope they don’t have to grow into dirty adults who suspect people’s intent for every little thing.</p><p>Well, I know that’s just my self-indulgence… Some dirty adult’s selfish desire for children to stay pure.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Heh. Aren’t you still at the age to be called a child too, Kiryuu?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Goes for you too, boss.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Umm~ so I’ll interpose even if I have nothing to do with this—</p><p>I think you should accept the offer even if it’s a poor move, if there’s really no other way. It’s a lot preferable to twiddling thumbs without choosing anything.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Hey, you <em>have</em> something to do with this, Aoba. From what I heard, you’ve been gathering materials on the boss’s request.</p><p>You’re sacrificing your precious time despite there not be anything in it for you.</p><p>You’re totally related. We owe you. Can’t ignore the opinion of someone like that, yeah boss?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Nnh~… You sure have gotten eloquent, Kiryuu.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Thanks to <em>someone</em>.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Hmph… Okay, okay. I’ll bend. There are too many things I don’t like about this, but they do say nothing ventured, nothing gained.</p><p>Rather than rejecting everything that comes our way and pretend not to see, maybe we’ll gain better results letting the current carry us and adjust as the situation demands.</p><p>No – honestly, that’s how I prefer it.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “So I thought. Haha. Good, good.</p><p>I talked big to the brats and said to leave it to me, so I’ll have egg on my face if you’d refused.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I can’t refuse your request as a rule. I’ll complain, and I’ll add my touches if the details are lacking. But from what I’ve heard, this sounds like a very ideal plan.</p><p>Darn that Mikejima… He’s probably trying to make us owe him, discerning that we view him antagonistically. Always the irritating man. Incorrigible.</p><p>Kiryuu. Even if we were to collaborate with MaM, we’ll be holding the command.</p><p>I want to avoid being in Mikejima’s complete care and having to consequentially bow our heads to him.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Got that. By the way, it’s not just MaM… Hidaka and Akehoshi from Trickstar, and the transfer student lil’ miss are gonna lend their hands too.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Members that have my stomach in knots. Not just MaM, but Trickstar too?</p><p>Eichi will definitely want in if he finds out. Don’t you dare tell him, Aoba.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Eh, why are you saying that to me? I barely talk to him these days…</p><p>And anyway, if it’s Eichi-kun, I think the more you try to hide it the more curious he’ll be.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Of course you have him all figured out. Eichi… I’m bothered how he seems to be doing something out of sight…</p><p>If he joins in on top of those members, there’s really no saving this project.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. That’s up to your skill with the leash, boss.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “So I’ll be at the head? I don’t mind if you guys are fine with it, but I’m not sure if Mikejima and the children will listen to me.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Force them listen to you. You’re the boss of us Akatsuki, right? …Show that you can take command, Leader♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Boy, what a headache… Well, that’s more or less how I wish it though.</p><p>Then we’ll start right away. Have the members gathered tomorrow so we can start building the plan. If we’re doing it, we better be giving it all our power.</p><p>To be honest, I wouldn’t have known what to do by myself.</p><p>You guys are making things easier for me by offering help.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Ahh, I forgot to say. Actually, we’ve all come up with some plans for the event together, with the lil’ miss at the lead.</p><p>It’s just a product of our chat heating up and all, so it’s mostly ideas and nothing else.</p><p>Here… the lil’ miss collected it into a proposal, so run your eyes through it.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I can’t believe you’ve had your way that far… What were you planning to do if I’d strongly opposed your idea, Kiryuu?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. We would’ve gone on without you, I guess.</p><p>Trickstar were especially thrilled about this; I bet they’ll carry on as they like if we just leave them be.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Do they realize they have the least to do with this plan? …Geez. How incorrigible.</p><p>Ah well. I’m currently gathering materials with Aoba and compiling them for easier use.</p><p>I’ll integrate these to the proposal you guys wrote, to bring it closer to perfection.</p><p>Let’s gather those members – with their diverging principles and ideals – under one rule, distribute them to fitting positions, and prepare for the future to come.</p><p>It may sound tough, but it’s worth doing.

They had no drive to start with; ain’t no way they’re gonna show up at the Dragon King Battle with its dope rule of free violence.</p><p>I’m not complaining if I don’t have to punch some guy I got nothing for at all, but let’s be honest…</p><p>This is so unfulfilling it creeps me out. What’s the significance of doing this?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You’ll see soon enough. Let’s work on gaining more victories while the DreamFest system isn’t very known; and then by the time the other guys catch on, it’ll have been too late for them.</p><p>In a while, there will be a definite gap between us and them. This allows us to mar the track records of those who may become threat for us in the future, too…</p><p>I expect their failures to be spread and turn fatal eventually.</p><p>The war has begun. But many still have their heads up in the clouds, believing the peaceful everyday will last forever, unchanging.</p><p>We’re making use of this chance to obtain advantages in the game board. That’s what the Dragon King Battles are for: to win as much as possible and create a good track record… make as many achievements as we can.</p><p>This will benefit us greatly in the future.</p><p>Eventually the rest of the guys will realize the true value of the DreamFest system, and we’ll have amassed enormous assets they’ll look to with regret and envy.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Great, well, I don’t have to do much but show up at the stage on time and be declared the winner. It’s just, is this really what an idol does?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Even if your opponent doesn’t show up, or they show up with no drive to win… you’re free to sing and dance like a normal idol, you know?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Couldn’t feel like it. We never did much advertising, so in the first place, nobody actually comes to see the show.</p><p>We’ve got no audience. At our worst, only me and the student council fellas on watch are there. It ain’t any different from singing at the karaoke; I’d look like a moron.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…Someday you’ll be able to sing in front of an immeasurable huge crowd. I hope you can think of this as paying your dues for that day, Kiryuu.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Can I trust that? Because you sweet-talked me into – nah, because your persistent offer tired me out, I’ve joined your plan.</p><p>But will the future you envision <em>really</em> come? I just can’t believe it…</p><p>I mean, sure, this is better than dozing off into dusk at the rooftop with nothing to do, but…”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “It will be okay… We’re at the right track so far… is all I can say. I’m worried too.</p><p>No one knows what the future holds, and we’re doing something nobody else ever tried to do.</p><p>We’re bringing a revolution upon Yumenosaki Academy, and we’ll become idols like we dreamed of.</p><p>Both the idols and the audience will share a moment of bliss, bestowing something upon each other, and it will last to the future, forever—</p><p>My goal is one such a brilliant place, as well as its succession and perpetuity. For that, I’ll endure any hardship, eat dirt, anything.</p><p>…I’m starting to feel sorry dragging you into this, though.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Hey, it’s fine. It’s a good way to kill time. Plus, you’ve got some starry-eyed ideals, but I don’t dislike them.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Thanks; I need you. If possible, I hope you’ll continue to lend me your power.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Roger that. What’s next on the list? Another Dragon King Battle?</p><p>We’ve been doing that almost daily these days, so we’ll prolly have no one left to provoke soon.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Not quite true. There are still many pieces we should definitely capture at this point in time.</p><p>We’re especially making little progress closing into Shinkai Kanata’s surroundings. I’d like to gather more advantages before going to conquer that one, but…</p><p>His interpersonal relations are peculiarly slight.</p><p>Apparently he has some relation with that – transfer student? Exchange student? – I’m not sure which Mikejima is… But Mikejima is also unreadable on his own right.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Mikejima? The guy who’s been dropping by the archery range, you mean. The dojo my Karate Club uses is closeby so I’ve seen him time to time…</p><p>You’re in the Archery Club; don’t you know him?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Hmm~ It seems he’s a close friend of Tsukinaga, a reliable member of our club…</p><p>Because of that, we’ve teamed up to take down common enemies, but he’s a man who doesn’t speak about himself.</p><p>Not just that. He rambles on and on about stuffs you can’t ascertain the truth of.</p><p>As I am now, I can’t judge when he speaks the truth and when he isn’t. He’s likely the same type as me, a talkative liar.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I think you’re actually a pretty honest guy.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I try to be as honest as possible when I talk with you. I’m making you go along with my dream; it’s the most sincere thing I can do.</p><p>It’s scary to think what will happen if you find out I lied anyway.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. I won’t punch you in rage or anything. Even a thug knows how to discriminate, y’know?”</p><h3 id="part-2-2">Part 2</h3><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…Anyway. We’ve gotten off-track. Real talk, what’s our next move?</p><p>If you don’t need anything, I’m gonna go train on my own or something.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Ahh, right… I wish we could keep doing Dragon King Battles like we have so far, but our budget is looking tight.</p><p>No audience means no revenue, after all. And we made it so even the losing side receives a reward, as to lessen the opponent’s hesitation when choosing to withdraw.</p><p>We are losing more money and gaining none. I did forecast that, but I’m thrown off that the war funds I prepared are depleting at faster rate than predicted.</p><p>No other choice, then… I hate the idea, but I guess I’ll look into that academy currency system Eichi proposed.</p><p>Basically, it’s a pretty common plan of circulating cryptocurrency as a means of transaction where—”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Ah~… That’s fine, you don’t have to explain. I don’t get that difficult stuff. I’m too dumb for that.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You know, I’ve said this many times before, but aren’t you making an unfairly low assessment of yourself?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/z9LM9ni.jpg"></p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Pardon the intrusion! Hasumi-dono, I have come to receive the entrance test for Akatsuki!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Nn? Huh, aren’t ya Kanzaki… Still haven’t called it quits?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Indeed! A samurai does not betray his own words! I will do whatever it takes to carry out with my decision! To join Akatsuki, that is!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You were a samurai? Now that you mention it, you’ve got some shiny metal stuff holstered by your hip…</p><p>Anyway, it’s slipped my mind, but we’re called Akatsuki?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Give some effort to remember. Well, we’re trying not to draw attention to our name right now so that’s fine, but…</p><p>Later on, all of us will be evaluated not as individuals, but as units.</p><p>In any case, Kanzaki, I have told you many times that Akatsuki is nothing like you imagine. It’s a peculiar unit I formed for my personal interests.</p><p>You should thrive in another unit that suits your strengths; join one or make one…</p><p>I am saying this for your sake, Kanzaki.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “No. A sword may not choose its wielder, but I want to become an idol under you, Hasumi-dono.</p><p>I admit I am saying this based on instinct, so I cannot lay down my justifications the way you do, Hasumi-dono, however—</p><p>I desire to be under Akatsuki’s tutelage. I am very much aware that I am being a nuisance, but I will stop at nothing to make you listen.</p><p>Yet, mere words do nothing to convince, so I shall present you my abilities!</p><p>Now, come! Give me the entry test again!</p><p>And then, were I to know what I lack as a result, I will devote my heart and body to overcome it… I swear!”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Nnh~… I’ve come up with especially difficult tests each time so you’d give up, but…</p><p>You just broke through all of them like they’re nothing, so I have no card left to play, to be honest.</p><p>I’ve been picking on your faults to reject your entry so far, but I’m running out of things to say too.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. Then just fold up, Hasumi.</p><p>I think this guy won’t bend even if you stab his gut. That’s what his eyes say…</p><p>I’ve seen those eyes on idiots who’d get on a bike for a chickie-run no matter who tries to stop ‘em.</p><p>You leave him be and he might crash and burn. Maybe not now, but sooner or later he’ll find another thing to obsess over and crash into something in his craze.</p><p>Then what choice you have but be nice and guide him until he learns how to drive safe, right?</p><p>Hey, this here’s a cute junior taking to someone like you. Watch the remorse hampering your good night’s sleep when you decide to forsake him.</p><p>I dunno you as well as a family yet.</p><p>But I know this much. I know you can’t let go of your compassion… you’re a good guy.</p><p>That’s why I’m helping you. I don’t get that ‘revolution upon Yumenosaki’, or other pretty ideals and dreams you’re spouting, but…</p><p>I choose to be with you because I’ve taken a liking to you.</p><p>This guy… Kanzaki, he’s probably the same. He can be another comrade like we’ve been for each other.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Ohh, you are standing up for me! I appreciate it, umm… Kiryuu-dono, I believe?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Kiryuu Kurou, yeah. Nice to meet ya. I’m vice-commander of Akatsuki.</p><p>Well, it’s only Hasumi and me right now, so if Hasumi’s the top then I’m the only runner-up available.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Hmm. Kiryuu Kurou-dono, is it? A gallant-sounding name. I am called Kanzaki Souma. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Don’t just start deepening your friendship there. …Ah well, I understand your point, Kiryuu.</p><p>I see there’s no other choice. It’s true we are in need of help, and I do want to develop Kanzaki’s talent.</p><p>It will be a bother having to look for him to educate him whenever he pulls something, anyway.</p><p>I guess keeping him nearby will save me the trouble of finding him.</p><p>…I accept your admission, Kanzaki. Welcome to Akatsuki.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Ooh! I am touched beyond words. I thank you for granting my wish♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Don’t start praying to me, I’m not a Buddha statue. …Incorrigible. A strange one has joined our ranks.</p><p>Anyway. I can’t have you complaining to me later, so I’ll warn you firsthand.</p><p>Due to various reasons, idol activity tends to come second to our unit. Forget standing on stage, sometimes it can be difficult just for us to gather for a lesson.</p><p>Again, if you want to thrive as a proper idol, leave and join some other unit. Feel free to resign anytime, Kanzaki.</p><p>Sometimes, our funds also get administered to the student council’s budget and cut up for other matters, so I can’t pay you much.</p><p>I don’t plan to work in the open a lot either, so don’t expect fame in return.</p><p>If these terms sound fine to you, go ahead and do what you want.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Can’t you word it differently…? Well, that you don’t cover it with lies is where you’re sincere, I guess.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Fufu. Understood. Then I shall do what I want.</p><p>I am in your care henceforth, Hasumi-dono, Kiryuu-dono! I swear to endeavor for Akatsuki’s sake until this life runs out!</p><p>Well then, where may I begin? Shall I serve some tea?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Geez, what’s wrong with him… I’m not some virtuous monk; I don’t see why he’s so interested in getting close to me.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha.

How did you sneak in here!?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Pardon. You appeared engrossed in your activity, so I hesitated to interrupt.</p><p>I first thought you were reciting the sutra, but it turned out to be a song – I suppose you are fond of singing like we do, Hasumi-dono.</p><p>I too sometimes find myself humming in the middle of doing ikebana or tea ceremonies, activities I should be doing in quiet; which often gains me a scolding from my teacher and parents.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You blunderbuss. Well, there’s nothing wrong with idols liking to sing, so I won’t scold you for it.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “A pity. I actually love being scolded by you, Hasumi-dono♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “What the… Anyway, you’re early, Kanzaki. It’s not time for the meetup yet.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Fufu. We will be staying over in preparation of the Restoration Live for the next few days, yes?</p><p>I came ahead of time, thinking you may need another pair of hand to help with the cooking, cleaning, or other chores.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Ahh, that’ll be a lot of help. Akatsuki, MaM, and then Trickstar and the transfer student on top of that would add up to almost ten people.</p><p>Just preparing the beddings, meal plan, and other stuffs was looking to take up my whole day.</p><p>And you guys are helping with this personal matter of mine out of good will…</p><p>It wouldn’t feel right to demand you to take on that kind of chores, so I was about to do everything myself.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “So I was right to come; my reading was on point.</p><p>As we have said before, do not be so distant, Hasumi-dono. If you’ll have me, then by all means, work me as you need. That is bliss to me – nay, my pride as a samurai.</p><p>To be of service to my esteemed lord and act as his arms and legs is my joy. Do not hold back. Let us split the burdens and shoulder them together… Hasumi-dono.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…You really are a good kid. Ah, not that – I’m glad to have you, Kanzaki.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Think nothing of it. I am indebted to you, Hasumi-dono, and I intend to risk my life to repay you.</p><p>In addition, you kept saying this is a personal matter of yours, but it has become a mission all of us share.</p><p>I wish for you to oversee the state of affairs objectively from the heights, and give us your unerring commands like always.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Fufu. So you’re telling me to order you around like I’m above you.</p><p>Sure. I can’t get rid of the twinge of conscience I’m feeling, but I’ll refresh my mind and try acting like my usual self.</p><p>I’ll reign arrogantly uncaring to the feelings of others, as the Ogre Vice President<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> of the student council.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Ogre, is it? Well, there may be those who estrange you as if you were one. After all, the truth is always hard on the ears, and occasionally shied away from.</p><p>…Oh. Hasumi-dono, you seem to have guests.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Your senses are as sharp as ever. I’ll tend to them; Kanzaki, you go prepare the tea. Feel free to use the teapot and other utensils you see on that shelf.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Understood.

It’s early morning and you’re already so full of energy. I’m tired from climbing the stone steps… Let me sit down and rest for a bit.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ohh, that’s not how a youth should act, Hokke! Don’t be such an old man!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You’re the one too much like a baby. …Well, I guess we even out each other that way.</p><p>That aside. Don’t take off on your own, Akehoshi; that’s your bad habit. We left the ‘other two’ behind… Let’s not rush ahead and wait for them here.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Just admit you wanna rest~ I take Daikichi on walks to temples and shrines, so stone steps don’t tire me out at all, being part of my routine.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “What’s with the noise, you two? We have monks in the middle of discipline here, so keep quiet unless told otherwise. I’m the one who’ll get reprimanded later.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/YGcaqms.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah Hasumi-senpai, thank you for having us.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Morning, vice prez~☆ <em>Toryaaaa</em>!”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…!? What’s with you all of a sudden!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Tch~ He evaded! You had me, vice prez! As I should expect from our fated rival…☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Allow me to explain. Akehoshi recently made it his morning routine to set a record on the least amount of seconds it takes to steal Yuuki’s glasses.</p><p>So I believe he can’t feel at rest unless he touches someone’s glasses in the morning.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “No, and that’s supposed to explain <em>what</em>? You always seem to be having fun, you lot. It’s almost enviable.”</p><h3 id="part-2-3">Part 2</h3><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…Anyway, is it just the two of you?</p><p>I know transfer student is coming in the evening because she has another job to attend to… but what about Isara and Yuuki?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? Did we forget to say?</p><p>Restoration Live conflicted with other jobs scheduled for Ukki and Sally, so they can’t participate for the show on stage!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. Until the very end, we tried every hand to make it work, like reworking their schedules…”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “But it just wouldn’t work out, right? We could take our chances, but then they might not be able to give their best on either job, which would be a problem.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I see. Well, you guys did say Isara and Yuuki’s participation was up in the air.</p><p>That’s fine. All that means is two shares of the rooms prepared will go to waste.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, I think they won’t! We’ve employed two powerful helpers to stand in for Ukki and Sally, you see!</p><p>Look! They’re just about done climbing the stairway!</p><p>Without further ado, let me introduce you!

The young kids are so full of energy~ I’m out of breath just climbing the stone steps.

Does Keito have no concept of inclusive design?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You can go home if you have a problem, Eichi.</p><p>I get Aoba, he helped me out gathering materials to be incorporated into the event plan; but what’s <em>your</em> excuse for showing up like you’re invited…? Incorrigible.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hehe. I told you, they’re both stand-ins for Sally and Ukki! Eichi-senpai for being a student council officer like Sally, and Blue-senpai for being a Glasses Spokesman like Ukki♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. I wonder if I can properly do Isara-kun’s part…♪”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Like I’ve been saying, I’m <em>Aoba</em>, not Blue~ And uh, do you really need a Glasses Spokesman?</p><p>Even on the off-chance you do, wouldn’t Keito-kun be more than enough?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Yup. There’s no pervert who uses ten to twenty pairs of glasses for different purposes like Keito does.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Use the word ‘enthusiast’. I don’t know what you’re scheming, but I won’t let you off easy if I catch you stirring things up, Eichi.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Meanie. Your childhood friend dashed all the way to your rescue and what a sad thing you say to him…</p><p>Oh the tears. Can I light a flame and relive the Golden Pavilion arson<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> here to wash away the sorrow?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Stop getting periodically inspired to set my family’s temple on fire, Eichi. You transgressor, don’t be shocked when you can’t pass in peace.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “So you say, but you’ll be holding my services when I die, won’t you?</p><p>Anyway, you might have a different opinion, but I really see no value in this building except to become lumber…</p><p>Won’t you consider burning the place down and build a convenience store in its place?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Eichi-ku~n. Instead of chattering, can you please raise up here? You’re blocking the way for other passers-by. See, it’s just a little more. Go, go~♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Okay, okay. I don’t understand these people, visiting for prayers at this hour on their day-off.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Actually, we seem to be a common stop for people who jog or take their dogs on walk. There are of course, actual people of faith who came for prayers, though.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Hmm. Well anyway… Just like Subaru-kun has told you, Tsumugi and I are here to fill in for the other half of Trickstar.</p><p>I won’t do bad or get in your way, so use me like you see fit.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…I can see Aoba taking on the role of a stand-in purely out of goodwill, but you’re <em>definitely</em> hiding a thing or two.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Tch, I’m acting mostly out of the good in my heart for once… Keito, you complain when I don’t do my job, but you also stop me when I want to work.</p><p>You just destroyed any motivation I had~ Maybe I should go home for real.</p><p>I thought Keito with his unit alone might have trouble keeping Mikejima-kun and Trickstar under control, so I came to lend a hand, but this is what I get?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hey now, vice prez~! Look what you’ve done; you just made Eichi-senpai sulk! Tell him you’re sorry!”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “When did you two get so friendly…?</p><p>Well, I doubt you had the intention to listen to me in the first place, Eichi. Do what you want, but don’t give help I never asked.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I hear you. …Ahh, I’ve finally raised up here.</p><p>I wonder, the people of old must’ve experienced this same feeling of achievement, along the endorphin rush caused by the heavy exercise… So, did they mistake those for religious ecstasy, and paint an illusion of God in their heads?</p><p>I’d love to hear the opinion of an expert. Tsumugi, what do you think?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Eh? I wouldn’t know.</p><p>I think God might find it hard to bestow you salvation if you try to make sense of Him too much, so perhaps you can try to be more of a fool?</p><p>Anyway, can I go ahead and put my things inside?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Yeah, you do that… You’re bringing a lot, Aoba. The training camp is just for a few nights, you know?</p><p>What manner of things are you… squeezing in there?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “No, you see~ While I was packing, I just felt like, ‘<em>Wouldn’t I need this?</em>’ ‘<em>This one too, just in case!</em>’ at every item I could find, and I ended up stuffing all of them in…</p><p>I’m no good, huh~ being too much of a worrywart.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Yeah, I can lend you most necessities, so it would’ve been fine even if you came with just the clothes you put on. Even if you forget something, you can always go home to retrieve it; it’s not far.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “That’s true~ Fufu, but I’m excited; it’s like having nights out with friends.</p><p>I know I shouldn’t be casually enjoying this since this is all for practice, but still.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Right, I’d like to confirm just in case. You all have the permission of your guardians to stay over, right?</p><p>Especially you, Eichi; you’ll cause a massive fuss if you stay the night without a word.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Don’t worry. I told them I will be in your house’s care for a few days, and they had this reminiscing look on their faces.</p><p>It must’ve taken them back to when we used to stay the night at each other’s house like good friends♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You mean when you came to play uninvited, and when I paid you sick visits and you wouldn’t let go, all which subsequently led to one of us staying the night?</p><p><em>That’s</em> the real version. Don’t modify them to sound like happy memories.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Modify? That’s just what they are to me, you know: simple happy memories.”</p><h3 id="part-3-2">Part 3</h3><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. I’ve heard the story, but you two really are childhood friends, huh?</p><p>It sure sounds nice to have someone like that… I used to move in and out a lot, so I don’t have friends I’ve known for long.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “…You can meet with many people and make friends with them from now on. There should be nothing like early or late in doing that.</p><p>Anyway, the word ‘childhood friends’ reminds me… Is that stuff about Mikejima-kun being childhood friends with Transfer student-chan real?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nn~ Hard to say. She told us she didn’t really remember.</p><p>We were supposed to interrogate Mikejima… -senpai about that, but it’s slipped our minds completely because new unrelated topics kept popping up.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Huh. If Transfer student-chan to Mikejima-kun is an important presence like Keito is to me…</p><p>I thought I could use that relationship to my advantage.</p><p>Like I did when I conquered Shinkai Kanata of the Five Oddballs.</p><p>But does a man like Mikejima-kun <em>truly</em> have something he holds dear?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Hmm. By the way, Mikejima and Kiryuu will use up their morning to do an inspection of Restoration Live’s venue-to-be.</p><p>So they’re likely to show up late… or so they said.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh? Why those two alone? That’s unfair~! Since we’re doing the Restoration Live together, I want all of us to check out the venue together too!”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. <em>Everyone together</em> – that’s just like Trickstar. Children who shine more radiantly than anyone when they’re gathered…</p><p>Can we really fill in for such children?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Trickstar itself is like representative of <em>fine</em>, so we’re representing for our representative— …I guess that doesn’t make sense.</p><p>I think we’ll benefit more from going with the flow this time around, instead of swimming in thoughts.</p><p>Anyway, it <em>is</em> baffling that those two went ahead on their own. I can’t think of a merit for either of them. Why would they do that?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Who knows. Mikejima seems to have taken a liking to Kiryuu, so he might simply want to talk to him without interference.</p><p>Well, actual practice begins in the afternoon, and there should be no problem as long as they show up on time. It’s their freedom to do whatever they want with whoever they want, even if it does pique my curiosity.</p><p>Either way, bring your luggages inside and go get changed.</p><p>Gather at the main hall after that. I want to discuss our schedule for the camp. Eichi should know where the main hall is—right?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Yeah. Ahh, it all really takes me back…♪”</p><p><strong>&gt; Hasumi Residence (Temple’s Main Hall)</strong></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Excuse meee!

Good morning, good morning, good morning~☆”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “~…♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nn? Huh? Why won’t you answer, Zaki-san? I’m lonely!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Look closer, Akehoshi. Kanzaki is in the middle of cleaning his sword.</p><p>If I recall correctly, moisture can make swords rust faster, so during this activity, he stuffs his mouth with tissue paper to prevent saliva from reaching the sword.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/zGN50xU.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, and that’s why he can’t speak. Wow, somehow Zaki-san makes such a lovely picture when he sits quietly like that~♪ Like out of a period drama!”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “…! …♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha, he’s blushing! What do I do, Hokke? You know how you get the urge to make someone laugh when you catch them in the middle of drinking milk? That’s what I’m feeling!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I get that, but fooling around with an armed man is asking for disasters, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “…Pardon. I have finished attending my sword; I apologize for not speaking until now.</p><p>Since all of you took some time to come, I thought I should take the chance to get my routine over with.</p><p>Now now! I have prepared some tea, so why not have a sip? We have Japanese sweets too. Here, sweet potato youkan♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ohh, I am very much obliged.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You’re getting swept into Kanzaki’s period drama, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…Do you guys just naturally talk like you’re on a comedy skit all the time?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Hasumi-dono. You only showed up for a moment before disappearing for the second time – where have you been?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Sorry, I was carrying the necessary equipments to our lesson room.</p><p>There is this relatively spacious warehouse a little apart from the temple, you see…</p><p>It was made to be soundproof due to certain reasons, so my plan is for us to have our lessons there.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh, what? A <em>soundproof</em> warehouse…? Smells fishy. You’re not keeping someone locked up in there, are you?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “What do you take me for? My parents built that place back when I held interest in music.</p><p>Playing instruments and singing in the premises would disturb the monks’ religious routines… They likely intended to isolate all sources of noise at one place.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Well, to start with, a temple is indeed a place of worship and discipline.</p><p>And because of that, I had been worried that we might cause disturbance by singing here, but that explanation made me understand.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah, same. We’re going to hold lessons here for days, but it was even more of a textbook temple than I imagined. I was worried if it would be okay, too.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I would have never invited you guys if it wasn’t okay. It’s my house, it’s free, so we can have our practice at low cost.</p><p>Mikejima and his commissioner appeared to be willing to share their budget, but I’d like to avoid depending on that man…</p><p>Funds are better spent on stage props and costumes, anyway.</p><p>We are holding a live show on a land related to the Shinsengumi. Winging the job by wearing lousy-made clothes would lack sincerity and invite backlash.</p><p>We’re giving this job all our earnestness and effort… Got it?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. We’re looking to learn from you, vice president.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. Thinking about it, it’s so strange that we’re doing a live show with Akatsuki on the same side…</p><p>Restoration Live! I wonder what the stage will be like?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “That’ll depend on our hard work hereon. And your group is the most fledgling among us; I won’t hesitate to exclude you if I judge that you can’t match our pace.</p><p>Light your fire and plug away, Trickstar.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Of course. We’ll give everyone a good shock like we always have. Right, Akehoshi?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You bet! We’re totally on fire here, so no worries! Wait until we show you the best sparkles you’ll ever see☆”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…You heard them. Of course you don’t plan to lose out, Kanzaki?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Indeed. I am also as much of a fledgling as <em>Torikkusutaa</em>, if not more…</p><p>So I shall also tackle the stage with determination, while looking to the senior members for guidance.</p><p>Ahh, the warrior blood in me is boiling in excitement…♪”</p><h3 id="part-4-2">Part 4</h3><p><strong>&gt; Hasumi Residence (Outside)</strong></p><p>&lt; Evening of the same day &gt;</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Darn, I can’t believe what you dished out on me…”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Loh06pD.jpg"></p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha!

I’m sure you can grow big enough to hold the Earth on your palm, Kurou-saaan!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Oh shut it. Where does a creature like that exist? That’s a monster you’re thinkin’…</p><p>Hey, you spruce up your words like that so you can steer the topic away while we’re taking in what you said, don’tcha?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Bravo! You’ve seen through all my triicks. This is another technique I learned from watching Rei-san, by the waay!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You pick the worst things to learn… Must be nice to be so slick; I wish I had your gift.</p><p>Anyway, that was no ‘inspection’ there. Working me hard as soon as we got to the venue…</p><p>All that singing dried up my throat. Now I’ve got this raspy voice like the old Nito.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Nito? Nazuna-san, huuh? He’s making welcome steps towards advancement tooo…♪”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Don’t you lay a finger on him, Mikejima. You’ll see the worst of me if you give him more pain and sadness than he already has to live with.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! I would actually love to see your real wrath, Kurou-saan♪”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “I kid, I kid. I’m not <em>that</em> eager to die…</p><p>Life did feel somewhat dreary and unenjoyable before, but these recent days have been pretty exciting.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “That so. Well, don’t cause a ruckus and disturb the people around you just because you’re bored, you clown. You’re not gonna live long if you keep that up, Mikejima.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! The human life is like firework! To bloom and scatter with a blast would be fun on its own right! The end…☆”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I really can’t tell when you’re being serious.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Neither can I! Hahaha! But it’s so nice to be with you, Kurou-san; this feeling of being pushed to my limits makes me happyy♪</p><p>I’m honored to be able to work with you today! Let’s carry the <em>mikoshi</em> together again some time♪”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Yeah, well, I didn’t think you’d make me carry a literal palanquin…</p><p>And not just any but a massive one that usually takes a group to lift. You made me carry that with you to every nook of the town…”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! Wasn’t it fun? Who could’ve guessed we’d come across a festival when inspecting the venue? What a pleasant surprisee!</p><p>These little happenings are what keeps a journey interesting…☆”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Surprise my foot. They left preparing and jazzing up the festival on our hands as soon as we got there.</p><p>Hard to believe you dunno what festival is held on which date. Wasn’t it part of your game, Mr. Festival?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “I wonder? There are as many festivals across the country as there are stars in the sky! Even I can’t keep up with all of theem!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “If it’s you, I bet counting all those stars would be piece of cake.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “You put me on a pedestaal… Well, I won’t deny the possibility.</p><p>Instead of pointing at them one by one, I just have to find the formula to estimate them, riight?</p><p>Okaay, why don’t we start now since the stars are just peeking out! Together, Kurou-san! Oooone! Twoooo! Threee!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Ahh, the stars have really come out…</p><p>The sun’s setting. We’re really behind the schedule. At this rate, we’re gonna have to sit through Hasumi’s sermon until night dawns.</p><p>I’ve texted him via smartphone, but he’s probably worried…</p><p>What if he’s making a shameful show of himself on practice because he’s too preoccupied with how we’re doin’…”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! I think Keito-san would be fine; he’s a child with composuree! He can put aside his emotions to accomplish what he set out to do!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “So you’d think, right? But y’know, he’s surprisingly the emotional type…</p><p>He’s learned various tricks to keep it under control, but the drop in performance makes it obvious when his heart isn’t in it.</p><p>…Wait, is that your aim?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Nn? What is what? Be more specific!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Looking back, all of your actions today would lead to the weakening of Akatsuki.</p><p>You keep me at a distance, which also planted concern in Hasumi’s head, interfering with his judgment and actions…</p><p>With Kanzaki still inexperienced, he’ll be thrown off tune when he notices how odd Hasumi is being.</p><p>Akatsuki would be a mess as a result. And seeing that, the other guys might think, ‘<em>Oh, so Akatsuki’s nothing big</em>’… yeah?</p><p>If worse comes to worst, someone impatient or unimpressed might snatch away Akatsuki’s right of command.</p><p>Restoration Live’s supposed to center on us, but take the wrong step and we might get kicked out of the stage entirely.</p><p>And that’s your aim, Mikejima. You’ve been an oppositionist; you’ll be thrilled when we crumble.”</p><h3 id="part-5-2">Part 5</h3><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Impressive! You’re really the likeliest member of Akasuki to be a thorn in my side, Kurou-saan!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Whoa, I got it right with a wild guess?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Well, your suspicions lack grounds, but you’re not wrong about my intent.</p><p>Just to be clear, thoough… Even <em>I’m</em> not conceited enough to think everything will dance to my tune.</p><p>But, I tend to break everything around me when I’m not careful, you seee. So I stop to think caarefully after each move I make, picturing what my actions will result on.</p><p>And then I take the next step. Slowly, wisely.</p><p>I’ll be honest with you, Kurou-san. Defaming Akatsuki and elevating Trickstar is my current mission.</p><p>I provoke Trickstar, lay a hand on what they treasure, and get them to hate me on purpose, so they won’t catch onto what I’m doing.</p><p>And those children seem to loathe having an outsider get involved in what they do, especially in a controlling mannerr…</p><p>So if they surmise that I’m actually pulling the strings for them, they might oppose instead.</p><p>Hehe. What do you think? I’m surprisingly elaborate and astute, aren’t I?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Well, yeah. You sure that’s not neuroticism you got there?</p><p>Walking through life while glancing about your surroundings fearfully, because you think you’re dirty, dangerous… honestly, it‘s not that I don’t got how that feels.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Right, I chose to be frank with you because I know you can relate.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “But I don’t get it… What’s the point? Even without help, isn’t Trickstar rising up at a nice pace?</p><p>They won DDD and made a revolution happen. At the end of the year, they’ll stand on the stage of SS as Yumenosaki’s rep.</p><p>They rocketed up the stairs at unbelievable speed. If you ask me, stopping them is harder.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Is that how it looks to yoou? All I see is them getting prettily cut up to suit a stereotype and made into a convenient tool of the student council… Eichi-san, especially.</p><p>Their revolution was wonderful! A true miraclee! A flower bloomed on the barren night sky despite all odds! <em>Taamayaa~! Kaagiyaaa~!</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup></p><p>And yet, Trickstar – either appeased or out of fuel – have been progressively withering and dimming since then…</p><p>…while the student council, dealing with the aftermath of the revolution, are rapidly restoring their position of power.</p><p>At this rate, the miraculous revolution will amount to nothing. Perhaps you guys have a different opinion, being the very people involved, but I only see the wheel coming full circlee.</p><p>What a waste. I thought a new arc was waiting beyond our liberation from that dreary harmony.</p><p>In the end, it’s just a prolongation of the story Eichi-san and Keito-san weaved last yeaar.</p><p>I can’t condone their story. The story which scarred the people who had treasured and loved even a man like me.</p><p>I could give my all doing the things I like and those people would accept me without question…</p><p>Better yet, they joined me in the fun; they were the rare few who would do that. But they got hurt, crippled, sapped of any energy to ever play with me again.</p><p>I abhor Keito-san and Eichi-san’s story. Its writers, who penned every twist and turn in it, all the same.</p><p>The saying goes that ‘<em>when you hate a monk, even the sight of his robe will offend you</em>’ …So I deny you, all of you.</p><p>Right now, Trickstar is the only one in any position to censure you.</p><p>They triumphed over you in a fair fight, so naturally, they’ve earned that right. Privilege of the victors, power over your life and death.</p><p>But they did nothing.</p><p>Standing above others should be the chance to make appeals, but they went out of their way to step down from the height and act like part of the crowd.</p><p>Ahh, what a waste! On the final stage of DDD, when I heard the encore that adorned their crowning glory, I seriously burst out laughiing!</p><p>Of course you remember what they said too, Kurou-saan? ‘<em>Let’s all stand besides each other and hold hands as we sing!</em>’…☆</p><p>Ahh, such children, Trickstar! That’s what I thoought!</p><p>Making no demands despite winning, with their own two feet they lowered themselves to the level of their surrounding people, and asked to hold haands!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…Wasn’t that admirable? I was impressed. Not just anyone can do that. Others would’ve gloat over their victory and take all the treasure they could get—</p><p>Saying it’s a privilege of the victors, as you put it. But, those brats weren’t fighting for such selfish desires.</p><p>They’re really just asking to sing with everyone else together.</p><p>That’s why they won, that’s why anyone was moved the cheer them on, and that’s why we think they represent us best.</p><p>If they’re childlike as you say, then we just need to watch over them and guide them to their growth, as their seniors in life.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “That’s also what I’m doing. However, the student council’s method crushes geniuses. Maybe it steadily produces excellent idols, but nails that stick up also get hammered down.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…Because the DreamFest system and the unit system were all coined to keep the Five Oddballs under thumb, yeah.</p><p>I agree it’s a method that chains down special individuals and geniuses…</p><p>But, I think Hasumi and Tenshouin should have already thought ahead.</p><p>They just haven’t got around to renewing the system, probably due to Tenshouin getting hospitalized last semester.</p><p>The Five Oddballs were conquered, and the war ended. With the times changing, Hasumi and Tenshouin are just beginning to write more of the story they discontinued;</p><p>Trickstar’s revolution being the new first page. They’re giving their all into progressing the writing right now.</p><p>Even if, in analogy, they only just dusted their office, gathered all the necessary papers for drafting, and took a seat in front of the desk.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Yes! I thought the same, so I watched, believing. I held back the urge to kick their butt to get them writiing!</p><p>But they never started, so I was getting a little anxioous…</p><p>And all things considered, the sight of Eichi-san and Keito-san naturally assuming the seat of the writer as if nothing happened really makes my skin crawl.</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/TH8Qqnb.jpg"></p><p>Despite the people they’ve hurt. Despite being the same type of rotten wretch as me, with no longer the right to speak of pretty ideals and dreams…</p><p>The ire, the resentment, the jealousy – it all drives me mad.</p><p>Because… Why do they get to do that when I’m holding back?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…”</p><h3 id="part-6-2">Part 6</h3><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Well, that’s why I’d like Akatsuki and <em>fine</em> to step down. I admit, my reason is entirely based on personal feeliings.</p><p>But just think about it. Keito-san and Eichi-san have their hands full with council duties, what’s with the mess caused by the revolution.</p><p>Akatsuki barely gets to be active, that it leaves you and Souma-san with lots of time to spare, right?</p><p>Then you don’t need to force it. No need to work. No need to be idols.</p><p>Withdraw from the stage like graceful losers and pass the leading role to Trickstaar.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/OivPoA3.jpg"></p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…Y’know, you wanna think that way, that’s your freedom. But me, Hasumi, and maybe Tenshouin too – we all want to stay idols.</p><p>Even if you tell us we’re not welcome.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Sure. But idols can’t exist without their fans. You can only rise to the stage when someone sought you, and it’s meaningless to stand there if no one does.</p><p>So I want Akatsuki to fail in the Restoration Live. You’ll keep failing, dropping in popularity, and vanish eventually.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Huh. We got a real snake in the grass here. Wasn’t the plan this time about holding hands like buddies and working together?</p><p>Friends and enemies, taking arms for the sake of the future to come.</p><p>But you, just you – you’re stabbing us in the back and aiming for our fall.</p><p>You took action ahead by goin’ to the venue and helping enliven the festival there, all to secure your position…</p><p>So that you don’t get discredited along us when Restoration Live fails.</p><p>The event would’ve been a success if we had you on command, but Akatsuki flubbed and ruined it for everyone—</p><p>That’s how it’s gonna look. Nah, that’s how <em>you’re</em> planning to make it look.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Yup! On top of that, I plan to make it clear that Trickstar did nothing wrong and worked hard with what they were giveen! All the blame will be pinned only on Akatsuki!</p><p>For that, I meddled with the event plan since its proposal stage, putting on the mask of a friendly big brother as I fed Anzu-san advice…</p><p>Which gave me the leeway to plant several traps fatal to Akatsuki.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “What a scumbag. The lil’ miss is a sincere, nice girl who doesn’t know how to doubt people.</p><p>And you’re set on deceiving her, exploiting her for your own gains?</p><p>Don’t you feel sorry at all? I heard about it, she’s your childhood friend…You think nothing of juggling with her faith in you?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “I don’t want to hear that from the guy who sacrificed Valkyrie and Shuu-san for his revolutioon…</p><p>Plus, I approached Anzu-san with the intent to use her to begin wiith.</p><p>…That’s probably not the right way to put it, thoough.</p><p>What I did was call a girl I haven’t associated with for years my ‘childhood friend’, just because we happened to have played together a little as children—</p><p>By making it sound like we had something special, I concocted the perfect excuse to interfere in her business:</p><p><em>We’re childhood friends. We were so close back in the days.</em></p><p>Under those pretexts, I nurture her into the suitable producer.</p><p>If she gets stronger, Trickstar grow along her. They can kick down the student council and become true protagonists.</p><p>Nah, I will pep those children up and lift up the <em>mikoshi</em> they’re on myself.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “And? How’s that fared you? Whaddya <em>really</em> want, Mikejima?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Something to kill time with, and stress relief, I gueess… As of now, I don’t have any dreams or ideals.</p><p>No one taught me how to find one, and they never let me in such beautiful concepts anymore.</p><p>Even though, as a child, everyone would treat me like one of theem.</p><p>…When she finds out the truth, maybe Anzu-san will hate me.</p><p>We really weren’t close at aall; I’m not surprised she doesn’t remember.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I think that’s nowhere enough to make the transfer student lil’ miss angry… She’s got a big heart, like my ma.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Kurou-san, your mama was…”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Heh, calling her ‘mama’ doesn’t exactly suit her image. Oh yeah, she’s in the temple’s cemetery. How about dropping for a visit with me?</p><p>I can’t feel calm unless I visit there.</p><p>I make it a habit to drop by her grave everytime I’m near the temple, y’see.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…Is it really okay for me to tag aloong?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haah? ‘Course you’re welcome. My ma’s the-more-the-merrier type.</p><p>I can’t bring her an offering, but I’m planning to clean the tomb at least… Come and help me out.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…”</p><h3 id="part-7-2">Part 7</h3><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “C’mon, what are ya standing around for? It’s just right around the corner, so get moving.</p><p>If we make Hasumi wait any longer, I feel he’s gonna start scolding us after each eye contact, and that sounds like a real pain in the neck.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Kurou-san, you’re such a curious guy. I’m sure I just admitted to some really nasty things theere…</p><p>I’m trying to cause Akatsuki’s fall, you knoow?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Well, I <em>had</em> a buncha things to say, but I forgot them while I was too busy listening.</p><p>Not sure I entirely follow, but – why not just do what you want?</p><p>Y’know, you’re too considerate. Like an elephant fretting over stepping on an ant.</p><p>You play up yourself as a villain, but I say you’re a real softie.</p><p><em>Everyone</em> ends up hurting somebody else through life. Being alive comes with being filthy. Mud and dirt drenching your body and not coming off…</p><p>That goes double for us, Akatsuki. We once took on dirty jobs to make <em>fine</em> shine. Even if you tell us we’re a filthy bunch, all I can say is that <em>Yeah, you’re right</em>.</p><p>We got lotsa people hurt. I know some scorn us for that, and that’s a given.</p><p>People like us should be paying for our crimes. Even if someone gives us a beating, I got no rebuttal.</p><p>Despite that – you’re not breaking any rules.</p><p>This is you we’re talking about; if we get under your skin that much, you could’ve make us gone with violence. There are other more callous options too.</p><p>But you’re actually trying to fight us on even grounds. You wanna triumph over someone you detest through assaults and traps, that’s not uncommon.</p><p>All animals do that. We live in a world of dog-eat-dog.</p><p>Deceiving the good with lies, pulling strings from the shadows to carry out a scheme… Actually, they’re things everyone does to some extent.</p><p>That’s just how humans are. You’re as normal as they come, no big deal. You just happen to be a giant with herculean strength, so you step on ants even when acting normal.</p><p>Maybe you feel a pang of guilt. But I just wanna say, we’re not ants here.</p><p>Don’t think you can crush us that easily. Come attack all you want, and see that won’t be enough to make us budge.</p><p>We didn’t last ‘till today by pure luck.</p><p>We still want to stay idols, so we’re not gonna let ourselves get crushed by the likes of you. We’ll fight back, pull out of it, and keep writing our story.</p><p>If that makes your blood boil, then hop on. It’s time to exchange some blows… Clench our hands into fists as we spout lies, like the dirty adults we both are.</p><p>But just one thing: I’m not impressed that you dragged Trickstar and the lil’ miss into this.</p><p>It’s not right to burden the brats with the disputes and selfish problems of grownups.</p><p>If you’re thinking of doing bad to them, know I’ll be there to take you on anytime. That’s my only warning, Mikejima.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…C’mon, stop dawdling. Put your hands together. You’re in front of the dead.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Is this your…?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Yep, my family’s ancestral tomb. Ma’s also in there… I think.</p><p>Hasumi explained it to me many times, but I don’t entirely wrap my head around it. I only understand bits and pieces.</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/vHNatOw.jpg"></p><p>Here’s a rosary. And this is the incense.

With that done, let’s regroup with the other guys.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “That was faast. I wasn’t even done giving my name to your mama, Kurou-san.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Ma’s the type to say the living should make use of every second to the fullest, instead of lingering around the dead.</p><p>But then again, she’s a chatterbox unlike me, so that might’ve been a tad too short.</p><p>Ah well, when I’m dead and join her up there, I’ll humor her like a filial son till she’s sick of it.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “I see. That’s right, the living can do nothing but make the most of their liives…</p><p>I still have a lot to learn. I discover new things when I talk with you, Kurou-san.</p><p>Throwing all my secrets out there refreshed me tooo…</p><p>I hope you’ll lend me an ear every once in a while. Well, I’m probably boring you, though.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Nah. I think I finally got to know you a bit.</p><p>…Thanks for not kidding around in front of my ma, and praying seriously for her happiness in the afterlife.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Of coursee. To me, every mama in the world is my aspiration, somebody I long to be. Even I know how to not disrespect them.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. Right, you’re aiming to be a mama for some reason?</p><p>I tell ya, that’s gonna be a challenge. A mother’s an unrivaled existence, y’see… The way you and I are, we probably can’t come close to their transcendence, even if we spend our entire life trying.”</p><p><strong>&gt; Hasumi Residence (Temple’s Main Hall)</strong></p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Hey, we’re back.

Hmm… so you guys were discussing the details of the event plan after practice, until they broke into an argumeent?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ahaha… I think it was my fault.</p><p>I brought a DVD of The Blazing Sword<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> thinking it would be good reference, and when we did a screening after the lesson, that seemed to have turned them all into Shinsengumi fans.</p><p>Now they’re all having a huge split over who gets to be the Shinsengumi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Me, me, I wanna be Shinsengumi! I keep a dog so I think I’ll be a perfect fit! The Shinsengumi often get compared to wolves, and wolves are dogs! Right?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I dare you to say that to Oogami’s face.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I think they were called wolves as an insult.</p><p>But of course, if Akehoshi were to play the Shinsengumi, then I will too. It’s better to make the role consistent between members of the same unit. It prevents existing fans from getting confused.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. I do feel that a blue robe will look lovely on you, Hidaka-kun.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It’ll suit you too since your hair is blue, Aoba-senpai.</p><p>Great, and Aoba-senpai is representing Yuuki, so he’s naturally on our team.</p><p>And, because he’s one of us, that makes us the more suitable to be Shinsengumi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hear, hear! Your unit name is Akatsuki so blue doesn’t suit you! I say you should be true to your roots by wearing some red clothes!”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “What the… First off, did you know that their blue robes were apparently just ceremonial wear, and in reality they mostly wore black to melt into the night?</p><p>That’s written in the documents. Right, Aoba?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Well~ but I think the public recognizes Shinsengumi by those blue robes?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “…If you insist on us wearing red, I believe we just need to slay the anti-shogunate rebels in a single sweep and let their blood drench our garments?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “This kid just said something bloodcurdling with a straight face! Ahaha, boy, what an entertaining debate♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “This is nothing as pretty as a debate! Stop with your selfish whining, rascals! This matter was entrusted to <em>me</em> to begin with, so naturally… <em>we</em> are the center!</p><p>Which makes <em>us</em> the Shinsengumi!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! [Laughable]! Surely you’re aware it’s no longer your personal matter, Keito-saan?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Nn~ But y’know, I think from like a story angle, we being the Shinsengumi and Trickstar being anti-shogunate rebels <em>does</em> fit the best.</p><p>I mean, since they’re rebelling against authority and causing a revolution?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. That’s a good point. It’s important to play a role that suits your nature.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I knew I could count on you, Kiryuu! Nice assist! Keep pressing on!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. What boss, did you take a liking to the Shinsengumi while looking them up? You seem to want that Shinsengumi role an awful lot…</p><p>Then, why don’t ya get on your knees and beg the kids to give it up?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Yeah, yeah! You should prostrate the way Isara-kan does it! I want to see, I want to see! Keito, on his hands and knees! Come on, hurry up! We’re all waiting…☆”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You are <em>definitely</em> getting a kick out of this, Eichi! Shut up already!</p><p>Just you wait, I’ll come up with a hundred or two arguments to blast your ears with until you’re convinced! And I won’t even need to prostrate!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…Hahaha. It sure is peacefuul. Very unlike the presumptions we were making.</p><p>Aren’t you all supposed to be enemiees? The order, and the revolutionaries?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “That’s true. Maybe it’s because our dreams are actually one, Mikejima-kun.</p><p>We all love idols; and wanting to be better idols, we scramble fervidly to bring the happy future even just a slight bit closer…</p><p>We’re facing the same direction, perhaps even brethrens fighting for the same cause.</p><p>It’s not as clean-cut as friends and enemies, good and evil.</p><p>Maybe that’s conversely hard to fathom for you, who observe the turn of events from the outside without ever coming inside the mayhem yourself.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hey, hey, Mikejima… -senpai, what do you think? Give us your objective opinion! Between us and Akatsuki, who should be the Shinsengumi?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…Can I really decide that, Subaru-saan?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You don’t need to decide; we’ll just hear out your input! We only do whatever we want no matter what anyone tells us anyways☆”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/meYwLR3.jpg"></p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hmm… I see. That’s the sort of children you are, huuh? You effortlessly pull what I can’t do. That makes me green with envyy♪”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. At this rate, maybe we should just decide by drawing lots? I think either of you would make for wonderful Shinsengumi anyway♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “No! As a Japanese-style unit, we’re the one who can recreate the original Shinsengumi to a T!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nope! Our reimagining of Shinsengumi will be more sparkly and shiny, like never seen before☆”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. I think there’s nothing to worry whichever way the scales fall…</p><p>But joining in the red oceans<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> is a foolish move, so I’ll nominate myself for the role of the bigwig who orders the Shinsengumi around♪”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Oh, then me too… That sounds the most peaceful.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahhh! If you two choose a different role, it’ll be three-against-two! We’ll be losing! C’mon, you guys are Ukki and Sally’s stand-ins, okay?</p><p>Let’s all be Shinsengumi together~ Okay? Okay?♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> ”Fufu. If in the real history, everyone had been Shinsengumi, maybe war wouldn’t have broken out…</p><p>But, history is interesting because things never go that well♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “That’s it, all this bickering will get us nowhere! Let’s settle this by taking turns putting a Shinsengumi-like show!</p><p>Transfer student, you watch and be the judge!</p><p>I see that you and Trickstar are close, but be careful not to let that affect your judgment, you hear me?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha, that’s shooting yourself in the foot, Hasumi. Well, we just have to show a difference in power that anyone can see, right?</p><p>Like we’ve always done so far… That’s Akatsuki, yeah?”</p><hr><h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2><h3 id="part-1-4">Part 1</h3><p><strong>&gt; Restoration Live Stage</strong></p><p>&lt; A week later, day of the Restoration Live &gt;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oohhh…☆ Awesome! So this is the Restoration Live stage!”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/sMWYxvg.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t bend forward too much. You’ll fall, Akehoshi.</p><p>I’m getting nervous since it’s a larger temple than I anticipated… Buildings of this nature just overwhelm me somehow.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/psdFrzu.jpg"></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. You know, if aliens see, they might spend the next few centuries puzzled. ‘<em>What is this building for?</em>’</p><p>To build an architecture this huge based on pure imagination, just to appease the soul… I suppose that’s what’s so foolish and wonderful about humans.</p><p>Ahh, I finally understand the words I exchanged with Keito a while back. He was right; some things do need ‘waste’ and ‘play’.</p><p>It’s the product of evolution of a race that cannot be satisfied by simply living; something humanity may boast to the entire universe.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? Not fair, Eichi-senpai is wearing the Shinsengumi costume!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Mmu? After further discussion and contest of performances, Akatsuki was made the Shinsengumi, MaM the outlander… leading the Black Ships, and—</p><p>We’re the anti-foreigner, anti-shogunate ronins, aren’t we?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. I found a spare costume for the Shinsengumi side that Transfer student-chan prepared in case of something happening… so I put it on. Does it suit me?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Between yes and no, then probably no? The costume looks authentic and embellished, but it also gives off the impression of being cheap.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah, yeah! Wouldn’t a more regal look suit you better, Eichi-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Do you think so…? I personally want to be closer to the people, though.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/0qUp7kV.jpg"></p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. The ‘Bakufu feudal lord’ role Eichi-kun wanted was rejected because it might be confusing at a glance.</p><p>So we have to choose another costume to wear.</p><p>Well, the program has it that we all sing the same song together anyway.</p><p>We only conduct ourselves slightly differently based on role, so Eichi-kun can probably stay Shinsengumi if he wants.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, Blue-senpai’s wearing the same costume as us! Yaaay, we’re buds~☆”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ahaha. Yaaay…♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. That ‘yaaay’ has been strangely trending among us lately.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. We spent a good amount of time under the same roof, so…</p><p>It’s a given that we take influence from each other. I’m glad too, that I got to understand all of you a lot better.</p><p>Because people start fearing things they don’t understand, you see.</p><p>And as they let their imagination run wild, it will assume a twisted shape, clouding their perception of reality. Like seeing through glasses that don’t fit.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, you’re properly carrying out your duty as our Glasses Spokesman! Way to go, senpai…☆”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Is this all I need to do as a Glasses Spokesman? And I still don’t understand if this position is really needed…?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You there, it’s about time for the show. Keep it together.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/aIKpenO.jpg"></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Wow, speak of glasses and Keito doth appear.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Eichi… Why are you wearing the Shinsengumi costume?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “We’re just finished talking about that. Isn’t it fine? Nothing wrong with us childhood friends wearing matching costumes once in a while♪ You know, I’ve secretly longed for something like this.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “What the heck… Anyway, we’re in one of the numerable exalted temples within the country. Watch your actions, or you’ll see the wrath of the Buddha.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hey hey, if according to the plan, weren’t we supposed to be holding a live at some public hall in town?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. A bus picking me up for a hike to a huge temple up in the mountains wasn’t what I had in mind when I waited at the meeting place.</p><p>That gave me a fright. Make sure to inform us beforehand, at least.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Well, I apologize for that. It was quite sudden, but… the local government decided to lend us this temple out of kindness.</p><p>My parents and my brother apparently spoke to the people of this temple.</p><p>I have no idea why, but my family is being really supportive of us.</p><p>Usually they’d left me to my own devices without a word or a helping hand, saying it’s all part of my training or something.</p><p>What’s gotten into them? Incorrigible.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “It sounds corrigible to me. You know Keito, I spoke to your family for courtesy before I was going to stay over.</p><p>And during the chat, they asked me a lot about your situation, Keito.</p><p>It seems your parents were worried because you’ve been perpetually sighing with a glum look for some time.</p><p>But you were enjoying yourself with the rest of us throughout the Restoration Live training camp, right?</p><p>We had many heated discussions until late to fill up the event details…</p><p>I think your family were relieved to see you that way. Maybe that motivated them to give their overtaxed son a push on the back.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “By giving aid they didn’t need to? …But I guess I can’t say it’s uncalled help. I’ll give them a massage when I’m home.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Right. It wasn’t in good manners to cause a racket inside a temple, so we could’ve gotten a scolding. Let’s be thankful they took it positively.</p><p>I pray that the Restoration Live will end as nicely. Just for today, let us idols show the believers a dream, in place of the Buddhism gods.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…You sure are good at wrapping up a story neatly, Eichi.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I’m the student council president♪</p><p>I was troubled when you pushed that role onto me. But now, I’ll show that I pull off the part more fittingly than how I look in this Shinsengumi costume.”</p><h3 id="part-2-4">Part 2</h3><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Fufu. I’m glad~ Vice prez, you’re awfully sharp to Eichi-senpai, so I was worried… but it turns out you guys do get along super well♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Is that how it looks to you? Well, our relationship is as frank as yours with Hidaka, at least… There’s the saying the more you fight, the better you get along.</p><p>We should spread ideals like that to the world. If all people do is hate and crush one another, there will be no development.</p><p>Be that we collide against each other and tumble, let’s advance forward hand-in-hand for now… Trickstar.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/AjyVeks.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…Sure. I wouldn’t think this way until a while ago, but I can see now that such a future is possible. Right, Hokke?♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah… Just don’t expect us to be too friendly, though. We’re still mostly enemies.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/B4GTOAJ.jpg"></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. Written ‘nemesis’ and read as ‘friends’, is it? I sure hope we can keep up that kind of relationship that all boys covet…♪”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Gentlemen! It took some effort, but they will be done guiding the audience to the venue soon!</p><p>The event will start in a few moments, so let us get ready until then!”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/g0yH2RG.jpg"></p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Ah… I was wondering why I haven’t seen you. Where have you been, Kanzaki?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Pardon. I was aiding Kiryuu-dono in taking care of a different matter – but a horde of foreign tourists then crowded me upon sight.</p><p>They insisted to take my picture, so dealing with them proved to be effortful… As <em>aidoru</em>, we cannot have our pictures taken without permission.</p><p>If Adonisu-dono were here, he would be able to explain it in English to them… but I myself do not know the foreign tongue that well.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. It must be because that costume suits you over anyone, Zaki-san! You’re like the ideal samurai! Yo, Number One in Japan…☆</p><p>I wanna take pictures with you too! Can I, vice prez?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Well, you’re a related party… I don’t mind if the pictures were for your personal keep. But there <em>will</em> be a session for pictures later, in case you’re not aware?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hm, we’ll take pictures to be used on the advertisements, right?</p><p>I see television crew too… This is looking to be a bigger job than I thought.</p><p>Cameras everywhere; Yuuki would have blacked out by now.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Yes, it is a tourism spot, after all. Hence, I believe most of the guests do not understand <em>aidoru</em> too well, nor hold any interest in us.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Zaki-san, a smile please! Smile! &lt;Pea~ce&gt;☆”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Pi… <em>Pii~su</em>…?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No need to feel obliged to humor Akehoshi’s every whim, Kanzaki.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. Are you jealous because Kanzaki-kun took Subaru-kun away from you… Hokuto?♪ Then in retaliation, <em>we</em> should take a picture together! &lt;Peace, peace&gt;☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…You’ve been behaving quite off-the-wall this time, student council president. I don’t know how to react because you’re straying too far from the impression I held of you.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “That’s because I’m partially on my off mode. While on this job, I’m just a helper, unrelated to <em>fine</em>…</p><p>Though of course, I’ll see the stage through perfectly, as Yumenosaki Academy’s top idol.</p><p>But I’m putting my status and other such constraints to the side, standing here as another high school student making the most out of his youth like you guys are—</p><p>As simply a boy named Tenshouin Eichi.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Right, you remind me at ‘helper’. What is Mikejima up to? I get anxious when I don’t have him on sight…</p><p>That man was making disturbing moves throughout the preparation…”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Oh, so you didn’t <em>not</em> notice. He planted landmines all over the place… It’s almost a miracle we can arrive at the day of the event in peace.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh? What mines? What does that mean?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “You need to grow up a little more, Subaru-kun. That might be where you’re endearing and precious, but I’m concerned about the burden you’ll place on Hokuto.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I think resolving problems is pretty fun. I like puzzles. So don’t worry about it and just live true to yourself… Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Uh-huh? Sure… I don’t really get it, but OK☆ I’m great at living true to myself♪”</p><h3 id="part-3-3">Part 3</h3><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “We have strayed from the topic. If it is Mikejima-dono you seek, he is guiding the guests with Kiryuu-dono… Shall I call for him?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Hmm. No need for that. Speak of the devil, there he is.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Ooooi! How are yoooouuuu!? Mama is heeeereeee…☆”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Y4ZybX6.jpg"></p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Shut up, Mikejima. You’re blasting off my ears with your yelling…</p><p>Sorry for going off on my own, Hasumi. I was dealing with some troubles with Mikejima.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Troubles? W-What troubles?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Yes! Our stage got moved to this temple high up on the mountain, right?</p><p>Some of our guests such as the elderly with weak legs were having trouble reaching this place, so we arranged a transportation service to and from the mountaain!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Yeah, yeah. At first we piggybacked them ourselves, but that’s gonna leave us too tired for the stage so…</p><p>In the end, Mikejima negotiated with the local youths to do that in our place.</p><p>(<em>whispers</em>) …Did you foresee something like this? Was that why you kept going for an ‘inspection’ to the location since the week before?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “(<em>whispers</em>) Hahaha. What do you think? It’s my principle to use every possible card up my sleeeve.</p><p>(<em>whispers</em>) The locals and I are close. Most of the people involved in the stage and gathered here have my back.</p><p>(<em>whispers</em>) It’s to steal the audience away from you guys. See? Aren’t I elaborate?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “(<em>whispers</em>) You’re something, honestly. I’m impressed.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Huh… Well, I guess that’s necessary. You seem awfully friendly with the locals, Mikejima.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Yep! I’ve helped out with their festivals quite a few times, so they took on the task of guiding the guests with pleasuree!</p><p>I arranged stalls to be set up as well, so the whole town is in a festival mood!</p><p>What a happy siight! Now there’s no mistake that the Restoration Live will be full of life, Keito-saan♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…That’s a help. We’ve been in your care this time, Mikejima. Let me say my thanks.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “You’re welcome♪ But I’m happy just being able to do a festival, so don’t worry about thanking me!</p><p>Let’s all do our best together todaay! Hip hip hurray♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “The cheek… Fine, it’s true you’ve been a huge help, anyway.</p><p>I am grateful to the rest of you, as well. Thanks to your cooperation, this is looking to be a more radiant stage than I can usually come up with.</p><p>Even had I done my best, if I only had my own power to rely on, I probably couldn’t set up a festival as animated as today.</p><p>Our commissioners are likely satisfied, and I believe this will be a meaningful experience for all of us.</p><p>Let’s make our best efforts today.</p><p>And surely, we’ll be rewarded. Not with material profit, because with the event becoming bigger in scale, our earning may be chicken feed or more loss. But we will be rewarded with the sight of the audience’s smiles.</p><p>Just that is enough drive to keep living.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “For Keito, maybe. Anyway, Akatsuki ends up having to use a lot of their savings, which probably cut your activity funds a great deal… Will you guys be okay?</p><p>Since we’ve made Akatsuki take on an arduous position all this time, fine won’t mind forming a partnership to back you up financially, if you want.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You’re the last person I’ll be in the care of. And no need to feel guilty; I was only doing what I wanted.</p><p>This is all part of my path to asceticism. Humans grow stronger by overcoming trials.</p><p>Although I feel sorry to make Kiryuu and Kanzaki go along with me.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Too late for that. How many times do you plan to make us say, you’re too distant… If I hated where I stood, I would’ve took off on you long time ago.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Fufu. Fleeing from an enemy before you opposes the way of the samurai, Kiryuu-dono.</p><p>Well, such jokes to the side… I would be most pleased to fight under your command forever, Hasumi-dono.</p><p>The value of a blade lies in its lord. You present an even wonderful version of myself to the world.</p><p>That delights me, for it is the ideal way of life I wanted.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. What an illustrative loyalty! Those Shinsengumi robes suit you all so nicelyy♪”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Well yeah, since <em>I</em> gave all my life to sewing these to suit us.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…Were all the costumes made by you, Kurou-saan?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Nope? Prep period was short, and we kept arguing over the content of the program and role divisions, that everything got pushed to the last minutes…</p><p>The anti-shogunate ronin costumes that Trickstar and Aoba are wearing were sewn by the lil’ miss.</p><p>And – that Black Ships costume you’re wearing, too. She made it from scratch, with so much care, starting with the design.</p><p>You gotta thank her later… That costume is really intricate.</p><p>She had to pull all-nighters, and I guess the exhaustion got to her, which is why she’s taking a nap right now.</p><p>I’d feel bad letting her miss your costume debut. It’s almost time for the show, so go wake her up.</p><p>See? She’s sleeping over there at the main hall. Look at her, laying down like in the portrait of nirvana<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup>…</p><p>Somehow, that suits her. That one little miss has a heart as pure as the Buddha.”</p><h3 id="part-4-3">Part 4</h3><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Speaking of, the lil’ miss asked me to pass on a message to you… Mikejima, she said she’s sorry for not remembering you.</p><p>Well, knowing the real story, what came to my mind was ‘<em>Of course you wouldn’t!</em>’</p><p>But she seems to really let the guilt get to her. Even throughout our joint lessons, she’d ask around about you, from Trickstar and the rest of us.</p><p>Trying to get to know you, to see if she can remember even if just a bit.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/jaTRGxr.jpg"></p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “But she told me. Although she couldn’t dig up the memories, she’s really grateful to you.</p><p>You helped with her producer work a lot and gave her advice, right?</p><p>So maybe it was the same when you guys were children. Maybe you took care of her the same way…</p><p>So she thought she should thank you somehow. That’s why this time, she did her best to tailor an outfit like that just for you.</p><p>Said she’d be happy if you like it,</p><p>And that she hopes you’ll continue to let her depend on you sometimes…</p><p>In return, she’ll give her all to producing MaM, she said. All the while rubbing her eye drowsily.</p><p>She was already nodding off by then, so her words were really fuzzy.</p><p>Childlike claims, don’tcha think? So pure and simple, you just can’t feel like doubting them for any hidden meanings.</p><p>But I like it, that costume. It’s like the crystallization of the lil miss’s sincere thanks towards you.</p><p>So make sure to pull off the look, Mr. Dashing. If you’re cocky enough to act like her big brother, don’t lose out to the costume she made.</p><p>Someday your lie will come to light, and you <em>might</em> lose her faith, but ‘till then…</p><p>Stay the big brother figure from her childhood that she believes you to be and feels grateful for. Otherwise, poor lil miss won’t be rewarded for the love she put into every stitch of that costume.</p><p>If you tell me you can’t do that, then you’re a real scum. No worth in you living, so I’ll cut you down, here and now.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/5wqfKSr.jpg"></p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Kiryuu? What have you guys been whispering around there? The show is starting, so get in position!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Gotcha. Sorry, nothing important, just idle gossip.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…Hahaha. Truth be told, when I took Kurou-san to the venue for inspection before, we did a job togetheer.</p><p>And it got us reaally good feedback, you seee?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…Haah?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Seeing that, I had a thought. <em>Wouldn’t Kurou-san be able to succeed alone without borrowing Akatsuki’s name</em>…?</p><p>So I secretly taught him the tips and tricks to succeeding as a solo uniit.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “What!? That’s unforgivable, Kiryuu! Not long ago you told us we’ll be together forever, and now <em>this</em>!?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “When did I say together forever!? Cool it, boss!

Curse you, Mikejima! I will never forgive you!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “No no, listen to yourself, boss! Reading too deeply into the enemy’s mind that you end up walking straight into their trap is your bad habit, remember!?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! So what will you do, Kurou-san? He found out about our little tryst. How about you elope with Mamaa?</p><p>We have the whole world to choose from to be our journey’s end☆”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Kiryuu-dono! Tell me this is a lie! Were we not brethrens bound by a bond thicker than blood!?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Oh man, what a pain; now Kanzaki’s getting the wrong idea too! Enough of this hogwash! The show’s starting, so pull your shit together, morons!”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Hold it, Kiryuu! This talk is not over!</p><p>You think I can get on stage while the doubt is eating at me!? I’ll see that we have the truth uncovered! Kanzaki, hold him down!”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/I9xAaiV.jpg"></p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “As you command! Internal strife is normally a taboo, but this matter also bothers me greatly!</p><p>I had faith in you, Kiryuu-dono! I thought you would not betray us, even if heaven and earth were to collide—!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “And I haven’t! Simmer down, you blockheads, the audience is watching!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! [Exhilarating]! Getting one-sidedly talked down wasn’t fun, so I attempted a little paybaack♪”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/03Lbz1p.jpg"></p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Mikejima~! Just wait for it, damnit! This isn’t my character…!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. It’s a festival; no one can stay the usual version of themselves. Before, I thought I can’t exist outside of such places.</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/oaeC2bO.jpg"></p><p>But maybe it’ll be different from noow… Can I count on thaat?
