They were well-written; I’ve gained an understanding of the situation.</p><p>Even an outsider like me could grasp the general flow of Project-Saga, thanks to you.</p><p>In summary, Jin and the kids safely got Rain-bows or whatever its name approved as a temporary unit…</p><p>And they’ve been meeting up routinely for the last month.</p><p>Yet, they seem busy enough with their own matters.</p><p>So gathering once a week for lessons seem to be all they’ve managed. Well, that’s just how unusually slack the project is.</p><p>Rather than proper idol work, it’s feeling more like something they’re doing together as a hobby.</p><p>Well, it seems to work as a nice enough breather for the kids. And it looks like a lot of fun from the side; almost enviable, really.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/voiiUie.jpg"></p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Switch with me if you think I’m so enviable, Akiyan~ Ahh, don’t wanna move…”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Jin. If you insist on rolling around, do it on another bench or on the ground. You’re interrupting my lunch.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/h3VluWK.jpg"></p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Why are you having lunch here anyway? We can’t focus with you staring like that.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Hmph. I was a little worried, you see, if Sagami-sensei was practicing seriously like he should.</p><p>I just want to observe while taking lunch. I don’t intend to interfere, so don’t mind me.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nah, I <em>can’t</em> not mind with that aura of dissatisfaction seeping out of you.</p><p>…oh? Akiyan, is that a lunchbox packed with a wife’s love I see?</p><p>Gimme a bite. I’m running outta gas after all that working out… (<em>munch, munch</em>)♪”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Hey now! Stop picking at my lunch.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/YuVlCrX.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What are full-grown adults doing arguing like schoolgirls?</p><p>Stop skipping out, Sagami-sensei. Come back to the lesson.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Uukh~ You youngsters are so full of energy it’s blinding me. I can’t open my eyes.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t sleep. If you <em>do</em> want to rest, don’t just lie down without cooling down first; it’ll affect you tomorrow. You’re not young anymore, Sensei.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu. It must be hard on you, Hidaka-kun.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah, Kunugi-sensei – good day. Sorry for interrupting your meal; have you come to see how we’re doing?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Yes. While I can’t say I have that much free time myself, it’s been on my mind whether Sagami-sensei is taking this seriously like he should…</p><p>… not to mention the weird order the higher-ups just gave me.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Higher-ups? Weird order?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Don’t mind it. So far, it’s only been the delusional elderly letting their persecution complex get the better of them.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…? I’m not sure I understand. But since you’re here, can you tell us when you pick up anything weird about us while watching?</p><p>Sagami-sensei has his hands full just making sure he’s properly acting like an idol, so he hasn’t been giving us many directions.</p><p>I’m worried whether or not we’re doing this right; if we’re really fine like this.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “It’s fine, it’s fine! No problem at all! We’re steadily becoming a unit!</p><p>You feel the same, right Himemiya!? Is your youth burning with flames!?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/b2ZVw2o.jpg"></p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Stop bothering me every second…</p><p>Ahh geez, I’m so tired. <em>fine</em>’s lessons may be hard and taxing, but Rain-bows’ are such a mental drain.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Oh, Morisawa-kun, Himemiya-kun. Good work to the both of you.</p><p>I’m sorry, really, that you have to get dragged into us grown-ups’ troublesome affairs… It must be a lot of work, having to deal with Sagami-sensei?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “No, this is a chance like no other to me! I am savoring every moment of it, sir!</p><p>But it seems to be a little hard on Himemiya’s stamina. Are you okay? Take some rest when it gets too much.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Don’t make fun of me. It does get tough on days when I have <em>fine</em> work after school and Rain-bows practice for lunch break, since I get no chance to rest…</p><p>And I haven’t fully adapted to life at Yumenosaki yet.</p><p>But, President is actively supporting this plan.</p><p>And it doesn’t look like I can get away from you troublesome bunch even if I whine… so I’ll just have to find the resolve… no, I’ll just give in and do my best.</p><p>Ahh geez. Why did things end up like this…”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fuhaha! You’re such a hard worker, Himemiya! I will affirm you with every fiber of my being! There, there, there♪”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Umya!? Stop clinging to me, it’s stifling! Are you asking to get bitten!?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Ahaha. Surprisingly, you all seem to be getting along well.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. What happened in DDD put some distance between me and Himemiya, but…</p><p>Morisawa-senpai has been acting as the bridge to connect us all, which makes things peaceful.</p><p>That must be the skill of a leader. I have to learn from him.</p><p>…well, officially, the leader of Rain-bows is not Morisawa-senpai, but Sagami-sensei.</p><p>Hence – stop lazing around and get to work. What’s a leader who won’t set an example?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay, okay… We only have once a week, and only during lunch break, to gather.</p><p>There’s little time for anything, so we have to use what we have efficiently.</p><p>I know that. But this little old man’s dead tired. No idea how my younger self endured a life of this.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Didn’t you have an even more taxing schedule, as a youth?</p><p>You supported the whole industry on your own… Watching by your side, I admired you for how much of a superhuman feat it was.</p><p>But I never managed to imitate you, in the end.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Hmph. After realizing that making an individual shoulder everything will crush them under the weight, spreading the load between members of a unit has become the trend, right?</p><p>I wanna leave the hard work to the young’uns, seriously.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Goodness. To think you’d reach your limit so soon, Jin. Are you sure you will be fine, going forward?</p><p>…I suppose I should really stop acting like an observer and move onto the support. That’s what the higher-ups ordered, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Eh, what? Did I just hear you say something ominous, Akiyan?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “No. It’s my business – don’t mind it.”</p><h3 id="revival-8">Revival / 8</h3><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “All right, that’s enough for breaks! There’s no point to us moving forward without you, so please come back so we can do our best together, Sensei!”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/e4WdSHm.jpg"></p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Uukh~… I’m supposed to be the mentor, but I feel like I’m being enslaved by my disciples.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “If you want to be respected as a mentor so much, show us how you live up to the title.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No choice, eh… Gotta hang on for a little longer, I guess.</p><p>Alright, gather around, kids. I’ll tell you about our coming plans.</p><p>We’ve run over the standard lessons every week so far, and we’ve finally become somewhat watchable. I think. Probably. ”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s where you were supposed to say it with certainty to boost our confidence.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Boy, you ask for a lot… Anyway, we’re going nowhere just sticking to lessons.</p><p>With Project-Saga articles getting stale, Mr. Writer’s troubled and I’m getting lazier.</p><p>So. I’m thinking we should hold a live next month.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ohh, a live show! So it’s finally time for the world to see us Rain-bows…☆”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Uukh. I don’t want anyone to see. I want to bury away the reality that I’ve ever been involved with these people.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, I’m sure you guys have your own opinions. But you know that live shows are the most straightforward idol activity there is.</p><p>We only have the minimum war funds that were provided at our formation, but if we hold official DreamFests, we’ll be rewarded according to our results.</p><p>Though in our case, I guess we won’t have much to do with the money even if we get a lot.</p><p>But if we have a bigger budget, we won’t have to make do with the rooftop; we can rent official lesson rooms.</p><p>The quality of our lessons will increase, and so will our efficiency; we’ll get to produce more results even with our limited time.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm. That’s true; even with muscle training, they say your growth rate is higher when you use the newest facilities and equipment.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Speaking of which, why are we practicing on the rooftop? Isn’t this place restricted…? Is it okay?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Of course. Who do you think I am? I’m a teacher.</p><p>A teacher’s an exception, so on the condition that I keep you guys under my watch… I get the permission to rent out this place for our practice.</p><p>In fact, since it’s usually off-limits, nobody uses it.</p><p>And that means we won’t be bothering other units; it’s very convenient as our practice location.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Nn~ I like it, since the view is nice.</p><p>But the only reason we haven’t had problems is that we’ve had nothing but clear weather. Won’t it be really nasty if it rains?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yep. It won’t be for a while, but the rainy season will come.</p><p>I wanna gather enough money so we can take shelter right away when the weather isn’t on our side.</p><p>We can borrow an empty classroom for no fee,</p><p>but since it won’t be soundproof, we’ll be bothering other people, and the environment’s just not made for efficient practice.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I see. Live shows will help get us the funds needed to avoid that.</p><p>So an investment for the future. I expected no less, Sagami-sensei… always planning for the long run♪”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. We can gather an audience by holding a live, which means an increase of fans.</p><p>There’s not much point to Rain-bows gaining fans, but <em>you</em> guys gaining higher appraisal and popularity independently shouldn’t be a bad thing at all.</p><p>Your units will benefit from it too.</p><p>You don’t seem very willing, Himemiya – but I hope you can consider that your drive to continue working as Rain-bows.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Plus, it’s a national magazine that serializes Project-Saga.</p><p>Depending on how it works out, you could sell your name to a wider audience than just Yumenosaki Academy’s.</p><p>This should be especially relevant to Hidaka, who’s gonna compete in SS.</p><p>SS gathers fans from every nook of the country, so you’ll benefit from gaining even just a little more fame.</p><p>Since the magazine serializing Project-Saga doesn’t just cover idols, you’ll get to appeal to an audience who aren’t usually interested in them.</p><p>You don’t usually get to reach out to that demographic if you just do regular work…</p><p>So if you can sell your name there, you may get a step or two ahead of other idols.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. I’ve been thinking that we’ll need to lay the groundwork for SS.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right! Necessity is the father of success! When your goal is clear, it becomes a lot easier to move!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, we’re a temporary unit that came outta nowhere.</p><p>We don’t even have funds; calling over a bunch of audience for a showy live’s just a dream within a dream.</p><p>So don’t get your head in the clouds. What I just described are things that <em>may be</em> possible if things turn out well.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Hmph. Of course it’ll turn out well. <em>I’m</em> here.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s a lot of confidence. Well, I don’t have the slightest intention to fail either.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right! I’m getting psyched~! Our current goal is a live show! And the first move we should make to achieve that is… what could it be, Sagami-sensei!?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “You guys are beyond dependable. Good boys.</p><p>I can rest easy thanks to you. When it comes to to preparing for live shows, though, I’m sure you kids have more experience and knowledge than I do.</p><p>So specifically, what do you guys think we need to do from now on?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You’re so unreliable, <em>Mentor</em>. This is the part where you should boss us around with a multitude of orders.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “That’s not my character… and you’ve probably forgotten, but I’m a retiree, a relic of the past.</p><p>I think we’ll encounter less problems if I emulate <em>your</em> methods, as you kids are still active in the field.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “That’s true… Um, so you see, if we’re holding a live show, we’ll have to call in lots of audience first!</p><p>President’s very cooperative with Project-Saga for some reason, so he’ll probably promote us if I ask?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, we need to come up with a program first. There’s no point in gathering people if we have nothing to show.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah, deciding what we’ll perform will help in the promotion, I’m sure.</p><p>Still, we’re a temporary unit. We have no song repertoire to choose from.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right. I’m not sure about using Trickstar or Ryuuseitai’s – our original units’ – songs as they are.</p><p>Each unit has different kinds of tunes and dances to suit the group’s style and direction, after all.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Eh~? But I wanna sing <em>fine</em>’s songs!</p><p>More like, I haven’t even practiced <em>fine</em>’s songs perfectly, so even if you make a lot of new songs now, I’m not gonna remember all of them!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. Of course. Most of <em>fine</em>’s songs seem difficult.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I have an idea. What if we rearrange our existing unit songs to suit Rain-bows’s style?</p><p>Of course, we’ll need to get permission from our respective units first.</p><p>But it’s fastest and easiest to use the weapon we’re most used to, as a rule.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. So using rearranged versions of our existing songs as our main weapon while adding a few original songs on top of them… would be the safest strategy, I guess?”</p><h3 id="revival-9">Revival / 9</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Anyway. So what we need to hold a live show is: songs, choreography, and then… costumes?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/uangx3q.jpg"></p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right. We’ll start by putting together a program, see how it works out, and do some fine-tuning to find a balance. We have to bring out some sense of unity so we have a basis for designing the stage and costumes.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Oh. The transfer student’s eyes lit up. Do you want to make the costumes?</p><p>I have faith in your skills, and it’ll be cheaper than buying order-made, so we certainly appreciate it if you’re willing to make them…”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah. I thought about asking my close friend, Kiryuu, for the costumes like usual, but I’ll leave it to you if you’re up for it, Transfer Student.</p><p>Kiryuu said he’s been busy with the commissions heaping up lately, too.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/A4QKwaG.jpg"></p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Umm, you guys are moving along so rapidly that I dunno what to say… wait a minute.</p><p>Okay, so we have a solution for costumes – then the problem is where to get new songs?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I can ask my father’s acquaintance to compose a song.</p><p>They already helped out during the revolution though, so I kind of hesitate to ask again.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right. Well, at worst, we can use some of the cheap songs that are up for rent.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Rent… songs? There’s something like that?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “They don’t use them in <em>fine</em>? There’s a paid plan for borrowing songs to be used for lives or classes; I think it started sometime last year…</p><p>Not everybody can make a new song each time they hold a live, so they provide this convenient system.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Oh… I had no idea. It’s really like commoner culture, huh.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I was thinking – since Sagami-sensei is part of the team…</p><p>What if we use Sagami-sensei’s old hit songs, or rearrange them?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Aah, true, reviving old idols is what Project-Saga’s all about.</p><p>Having nostalgic songs may be nice; it’s important to have tunes that suit the project’s goal.</p><p>And if it’s Sagami-sensei’s hit songs – they’re my favorites to sing at karaoke, so I can perform them immediately.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Ah… Morisawa-senpai, do you like karaoke?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm? Do you like karaoke too, Himemiya? Ah, but that’s not possible; you’re a well-off young master, after all.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “No, I li… ne-never mind!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ Well, they may fit Project-Saga, but all my songs are pretty out of date if you listen to them now, y’know… are you guys sure?</p><p>Aren’t they lame and unbearable to hear, for modern kids?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “It’s okay, Sagami-sensei! Masterpieces transcend time…☆”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nngh, I personally don’t wanna drag you youngsters into us old men’s fondness for nostalgia…</p><p>But I’ll look into it; remaking famous old songs isn’t so rare in the music industry.</p><p>It’s just, even though they’re part of my repertoire, I don’t hold the copyrights.</p><p>Some songs may have difficult terms of use, or demand crazily high fees.</p><p>In case of these problems cropping up, we should look to composing new, modern songs like normal.</p><p>I’ve said this over and over, but Project-Saga’s a low-budget plan and we have no money.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Yeah, <em>that’s</em> the problem. We’re like paupers or something… But that’s why I wanna pull off the live and raise lots of funds.</p><p>I think I’m starting to get motivated. Being an idol really is all about performing in live shows.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “But that’s not the only thing constituting idol activity.</p><p>With promoting the live show, servicing the fans, being interviewed by Mr. Writer, and getting your pictures taken… you’ll get to have a full course of idol-like experience.</p><p>I pray that those experiences will turn out to be of use on your original paths.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Fufu. Actually, since in <em>fine</em>, I have my hands full just catching up to my seniors…</p><p>I think it <em>might</em> be pretty new and fun that I get to decide everything from square one with the team and do normal idol stuff like this.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah. I’m having fun too. I have no dissatisfaction towards Ryuuseitai, but it’s gotten further dyed in hero themes because of my hobby…</p><p>So I’m happy I get to act like a straightforward, normal idol; feels like if I’ve become a newbie all over again.</p><p>Actually, I’m kinda worried that I’ve gotten so set in my hero ways that I’ve lost the ability to act like an idol.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “We ran over the basic lessons so that wouldn’t happen, right?</p><p>… I also think it’s a happy thing, that I get to forget revolutions and personal enmities, and perform as an idol in my natural state.</p><p>An idol isn’t about defeating enemies or changing the world – it’s about singing and dancing to satisfy the audience in front of you.</p><p>I feel like I just got reminded of that very natural thing.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “You’re not supposed to forget it. It’s important, you hear me?</p><p>Nah… as long as you guys don’t forget, you will always be idols.</p><p>You can keep standing on stage, for as long as you’re sought for.</p><p>I’ve thrown away that right with my own hands, but I think if it’s you guys – you won’t end up like me.</p><p>… huh, wait? I just noticed Kunugi-sensei’s gone?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Huh? You’re right… But lunch break is gonna end soon, so he’s probably just done here?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ Seriously, what did he come here for…? Just to gawk?</p><p>Well, who cares. Lunch break <em>is</em> ending… so let’s pack up and disperse, guys.</p><p>Don’t be late to your classes; the other teachers will bawl me out if you do.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmph… Geez, just when I thought you said something pretty nice, you have to be like <em>that</em>.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahaha. But the little unfortunate sides to people are what exactly gives them a lovable, human touch, you don’t think? No?”</p><p><strong>&gt; Hallway, 2nd Floor</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Gg6g7m5.jpg"></p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “…Yes. Yes.</p><p>Right. I’m sorry we have to speak over the phone – Sagami-sensei may pick up on us if I summon you through a school-wide broadcast…</p><p>But if it’s necessary, we can meet up so I can explain in person.</p><p>Not necessary? That’s good. It’s quite troublesome to have to find you and speak to you directly.</p><p>Yes, as I’ve mentioned before, I’m thinking of getting involved in Project-Saga.</p><p>They’re too relaxed, too comfortable, with no sense of danger at all.</p><p>I believe they need a little <em>stimulation</em> from the outside. Yes, that’s how living beings grow, after all.</p><p>Of course. Come to the faculty office after school. We will need to pick out some kids to be our ‘teammates’…</p><p>Yes, if you have no problem with it, then please do get the children I recommended.</p><p>Fufu.

You two, tone down your voices a bit. Kunugi-sensei said to ‘be quiet’, didn’t he? Let’s obey the teachers when we can♪”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Nngaah, I got scolded! I got reprimanded by a criminal…!”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “&lt;HiHi~♪&gt; So that’s how the rule goes~? Then Sora will be quiet!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “There, there. Err, Kunugi-sensei, where do these two need to be delivered to?</p><p>Should I just chuck them somewhere in that lounge space with the sofa?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Yes, like that. … but with a little more care, if you can.</p><p>You may become ‘teammates’ going forward, so you shouldn’t treat them in a way that’ll make them hate you.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. I’m a solo unit; I have no idea how to treat teammates♪”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> (Geez… perhaps I’ve made a mistake. Mikejima-kun is incredibly outstanding as manpower, but I see he’s the same troublemaker as ever, messing up the school’s order.</p><p>Hmph.

You have to consume the essential nutrients!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Right! Drink more milk; milk!”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Uukh. I’m not the one who decides what I get ta swallow.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu. I told you children to be quiet – but well, I guess I shouldn’t expect any different. You’re at the age where the slightest things can seem funny.</p><p>In any case. Let’s begin our talk; I’ve prepared tea and snacks, so feel free to sip and nibble on them.</p><p>If you don’t waste time on banter, we can get the talk over with quickly.</p><p>The reason I gathered you all here today… is because I want you to take on a certain campus part-time job.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Nngaah~? What, is that what this is…?</p><p>Then ya could’ve said from the beginnin’. Ya don’t have to kidnap me by force; I would’ve come if I got called normally.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “&lt;HaHa~♪&gt; But Sora had fun! It’s just since Sora got carried off right in the middle of Game Club activity, Shisho may be worried~”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. I’ll speak to Natsume-san later. To Shuu-san too.</p><p>I have some ties with the Five Oddballs, and they’re a reasonable bunch, so I’m sure they’ll understand.</p><p>Let me apologize for being rough with you two. But it was my duty to gather and take you to the faculty office within today.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “You didn’t have to force it if it looked to be impossible.</p><p>But there’s nothing that can be done about that now; and I’m grateful that you gathered the kids I asked.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Okay! Since my business here is done, can I go?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “No. You need to sit down too, Mikejima-kun.</p><p>You can act the lone wolf if it pleases you, but I cannot let an irregularity like a ‘solo unit’ roam free forever.</p><p>Take this chance to get used to working in a team. In the coming era, idols won’t be able to live alone.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! That goes for <em>any</em> era and <em>everyone</em>, even non-idols!</p><p>Can you consider my feelings in choosing to be alone, even among other humans who live in packs?</p><p>Ah well! This is work too – no, a festivaaal♪ Then it’s just manners to enjoy it!</p><p>I’ll thank you for granting me this chance to get involved with Yumenosaki Academy’s main storyline, for I haven’t been able to do so until now!”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Main storyline? No, an extra side story is probably the most this can be. An event that’s set off outside of the narrative; a subplot that won’t matter either way.</p><p>But it ‘may end up different’, so I intend to make a move in the early stages. That’s what I called the three of you over for.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Right! Get a walking stick before stumbling! Get three sticks for sustainability!”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I think you mean pillars, for the second one?”</p><h3 id="revival-11">Revival / 11</h3><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “I-I can’t follow at all… Uhh, umm, what’s that mean? Harukawa-kun, do ya know?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “&lt;HiHi~♪&gt; Sora doesn’t know what it means, but Sensei is giving off a fun ‘color’~ It’s usually hidden somewhere hard to see, but it shines with seven colors today!</p><p>Sensei, is that your true ‘color’?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “What are you talking about? Anyway, as I’ve said before… I’ll need you to take part in a campus part-time job.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “I-It feels like there’s not goin’ to be a choice… Do we have a right to refuse?</p><p>I wanna get more activity funds, so of course I’m happy t’participate in campus part-time jobs, but~?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “You <em>can</em> refuse, but I don’t recommend it.</p><p>Mikejima-kun, Kagehira-kun, Harukawa-kun… the academy keeps a watchful eye on you due to your repetitive problematic behaviors.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Eh, no way? But I swear I haven’t done anythin’ wrong…”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I know. But even when you haven’t done anything bad, those who provide no benefit to the big picture are weeded out; that’s simply how it goes in the world of adults.</p><p>This isn’t compulsory education either, so they can’t afford to keep freeloaders around forever.</p><p>Kagehira-kun, you’ve been skipping classes to do part-time jobs, haven’t you? You are what society normally calls a delinquent.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “De-Delinquent? That’s not it, I just need to gather funds f’r Valkyrie…</p><p>I always try to attend classes too; even if I usually get too tired an’ end up sleepin’ through 'em.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Take the classes properly; at least study your tuition’s worth.</p><p>Consider the feelings of the teachers who have to drone on and on in front of sleeping children because they’re duty-bound to hold a lecture.</p><p>It isn’t only aggravating and saddening – it feels hollow after a while.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Uukh. I’m sorry… Th-That’s such a deserved reprimand I can’t argue back.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Well, you are still among the better ones, Kagehira-kun.</p><p>The bigger problem here is Mikejima-kun, who has probably broken about every school rule there is, and Harukawa-kun, who keeps doing bizarre things such as climbing the school walls.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! [Free and uncontrolled]! I won’t be stopped from acting however I want!”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “&lt;HuHu~♪&gt; I’m sorry! When scolded, apologizes!</p><p>But it doesn’t say anywhere in the school rules… that we must use the corridors and stairs during transit instead of climbing the walls, right~?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Well, you two certainly know how to argue back… Don’t misunderstand. I am not your enemy.</p><p>In fact, I am talking to you because I want to protect you and do something for you.</p><p>The three of you have some form of connection with that ‘Five Oddballs’ group, yes?</p><p>In the last quarter of last year, that name was another word for ‘troublemakers’. The academy doesn’t think well of them.</p><p>The idol trade is all about fame, and faith. It isn’t smart to let any source of bad reputation roam free.</p><p>Although the Five Oddballs are incredibly excellent idols, so the academy seems to be unwilling to let go of them either.</p><p>However, as people related to them, you may turn into targets of criticism and attack.</p><p>You do not want to cause problems for each of your important people, I believe? Then reflect on your actions and fix your behaviors.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Anyway. If you accept the part-time job I’m about to offer you, I promise to have your backs.</p><p>As long as you don’t cross the line, I can feign ignorance towards any of your problematic behaviors.</p><p>I am in charge of student guidance – so I can offer you my connivance, to some extent.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Oh, a backroom deal? What a bad, bad teacher you are; I don’t dislike that♪”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Eh, eh? What’s that mean? I still can’t follow!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. This is what Kunugi-sensei is saying… <em>if we lend him a hand, he’ll write off all of our problematic behaviors so far</em>.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I’m not writing them <em>off</em>. But well, I will be <em>lenient</em>.</p><p>I will also negotiate with the other teachers and convince them – no… I will become your ally.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “And you ask us to be your soldiers in exchange? Using someone’s weakness against them for your exploits – that’s what the mafia does, you knoow♪”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “It doesn’t sound like a joke coming from you, Mikejima-kun.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Nngaah~? I don’t really understand, but that smells like serious trouble! Wh-What are you gonna make us do… Kunugi-sensei?</p><p>I’ll hafta say no to gettin’ involved in crimes! I don’t want Oshi-san t’get a scratch on 'is record because of me!”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu. How could I involve my dearest students in criminal acts? I’m in the position where I must actively stop <em>you</em> when I catch you in one. Don’t make light of me.</p><p>Anyway, the content of this part-time job is easy. I need you to form a temporary unit.</p><p>The unit name will need to be thought through together, but I plan for us to use ready-made songs and costumes…</p><p>So hopefully, it won’t be too much of a workload for you.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Nnn, ‘temporary unit’? Not a word Sora’s heard~?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Right, first years would have no idea, I suppose… I will explain it to you later. However, this temporary unit will have to perform in a certain live show next month.</p><p>Until then, you are prohibited from taking other on-campus part-time jobs; you will devote yourselves to unit lessons.</p><p>Of course you don’t mind? You will have to take more idol-like jobs like this, instead of cleaning the rooms or doing laundry.</p><p>I will also pay you the money you probably would have gained had you spent that period doing part-time jobs.</p><p>And as I’ve mentioned, I will overlook your problematic behaviors, to some extent.</p><p>What do you think? This isn’t a bad deal at all, is it? Will you accept?”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Eeehh~ Honestly I don’t wanna be part o’ another unit besides Valkyrie… but based on the talk so far, I probably can’t refuse?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Why, yes. This isn’t a suggestion; it’s an order. You must obey your teacher, you see.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! [What arrogance]! It makes me want to resist for no reason, but there <em>does</em> seem to be no disadvantage to accepting?</p><p>Even if it doesn’t settle well with me to have my free will stolen away and dance to someone else’s tune.</p><p>I don’t mind agreeing. I was thinking to comply with the unit system and work in one <em>just</em> once, rather than just observing from the side.</p><p>Experience is the best teacher, right? I’m sure it won’t go to waste.</p><p>Know your enemy, know yourself, and you shall win a hundred battles. I was thinking to get a direct feel of the logic that currently governs this academy.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Nn~ Sora will be happy just being able to sing and dance while having fun, but can Sora confirm this with Shisho first?</p><p>Discussing with Shisho before making hard decisions has become Sora’s style lately~”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Yes, well, I don’t mind if you take it home with you and think it through first.</p><p>Just keep in mind that the live show is in a month; we don’t have much time to spare.</p><p>If you spend too much time thinking, we’ll lose the time we could’ve used on doing lessons, so I advise you to give me an answer as soon as possible.</p><p>Still… do give it proper thought before making the decision. I said it was an order, but the freedom to comply with it or not still lies with you.</p><p>I can force you… but this time, I won’t.</p><p>For the time being, this case doesn’t seem to demand such desperate measures. Not a do-or-die that will decide the direction of anyone’s life; nothing but a comparatively irrelevant, silly story.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “…”</p><h3 id="revival-12">Revival / 12</h3><p><strong>&gt; Rooftop</strong></p><p>&lt; Approximately a week later, Rain-bows’ activity day &gt;</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Bon appetit~☆</p><p>(<em>munch, munch, munch</em>) ♪ It’s delicious as always!

My Slave No.1 is Yuzuru, so she’s No.2.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m really not one to say, but be more respectful to your elders. And don’t speak while eating; it’s poor manners.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “You’re so fussy~ Stop sounding like Yuzuru.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Heh. Fushimi asked me to keep an eye on you, so it suits me perfectly that I ‘sound like Yuzuru’.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Gehh, don’t just be friends with my slave without permission… darnit, Yuzuru, this is a betrayal to <em>fine</em>.</p><p>Well, I don’t actually mind. Hidaka-senpai, you’re nowhere as noisy as Yuzuru.</p><p>I dunno what you’re holding back for, but you don’t meddle with me too much, so I don’t find you so grating.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…If you wish, I can be a lot harsher with you. I still don’t fully grasp how I should deal with my juniors; I’m not sure how much distance to keep.</p><p>But I wouldn’t mind constantly badgering and babysitting you around the clock, you know… <em>Princess?</em>”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Uehh? What the heck? Don’t give me weird titles!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “? Isn’t it your nickname? That’s what buchou said.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Buchou? Ah, that Long Hair?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. When I told him about Rain-bows during club, he told me ‘You must escort the Princess properly, Prince♪’ or something along those lines.</p><p>It seems buchou is also cheering us on.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Are you sure~? That sounds like he’s making fun of us. I still have no idea what goes on under that long hair of his.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I have no idea either. …but anyway, you can call me by a nickname too.</p><p>We’ve become comrades through some trick of fate; I’d prefer that you don’t keep up a hostile act because I’m an ‘enemy’ or ‘traitor’.</p><p>Also, I thought this after watching Akehoshi – calling each other by nicknames will make us seem like we get along really well. Isn’t it nice?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Is there any need to get along…? Well, small fry like Trickstar gotta stick together to survive, I guess.</p><p>But each of us has to stand independently as peerless, undefeated kings in _fine_♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Really? Last year, <em>fine</em> was the one making a show of behaving like weaklings sticking together… I guess the times have changed.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…? What? <em>fine</em> were always main characters of absolute justice, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Is that how it looks from the outside? The result of skilled information manipulation, I guess; talk about detestable.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/HrC05Lb.jpg"></p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ooi. The junior duo over there, don’t just get along on your own. Let me in too.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Don’t group us weirdly like that. … you were discussing something difficult with Sagami-sensei, so we were giving you some space, you know?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right. Actually, he told me to explain it to you guys too, so let me have a word.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Morisawa-senpai, where’s Sagami-sensei? I only just noticed he’s gone. Can’t he even do explanations on his own… that slothful teacher?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Don’t say that. School teachers are busier than we imagine, you know.</p><p>He can’t deal with us all the time; just now he had to rush to the infirmary because an emergency patient came.</p><p>He said he’ll get us something nice while he’s away, so let’s wait expectantly. Seems like it has to do with the transfer student, who hasn’t shown up today.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “With the transfer student? Come to think of it, she’s not here today; I thought she was just busy producing other units.</p><p>The transfer student’s been focusing on some other work even during class lately… She’s visibly busy; it’s almost hard to call out to her.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm… Well, that girl is a hard worker.</p><p>Although the Produce Course is still on trial and she’s the only person there, jobs for producer just keep increasing.</p><p>At this rate, she’s going to reach her breaking point. As someone who’s usually by her side, you should watch out for her, Hidaka.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah, of course, naturally. But the transfer student’s not being forced to work, it’s what she wants to do—</p><p>So I’m not sure if I should stop her just because I’m worried she works too much.</p><p>Anyway. So what is it that you wanted to explain… Morisawa-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right. Well, let’s just relax and have lunch as we talk.</p><p>Sagami-sensei will come back eventually, possibly with the transfer student. I personally want all of Rain-bows gathered for our discussion.</p><p>Two is better than one, three is better than two, and everyone together is better than three.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Hmph. You guys can’t live without constantly herding together or something?</p><p>That’s okay, though. Rain-bows activities are mostly such a pain, but the mealtimes are pretty fun…</p><p>I have to stay sharp since the lessons are tougher than I thought – but that’s why the mealtime that comes after is my haven~♪</p><p>It’s my chance to slow down and breathe. Slave No.2 puts my favorite food in the lunchbox too.</p><p>And I don’t have to take ‘Yuzuru’s Table Manners Course’ every time.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Himemiya, do you always eat lunch with that kid… Fushimi? Sounds to me like you two are close buddies☆”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “We’re not… He’s just a servant who has worked at our place a long time; a guy I just can’t get rid of.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Really?

Who could’ve guessed?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fuhaha! But that’s why life is precious! Don’t you think so, guys!?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Wow, annoying… How are you constantly hyped like that? The Long Hair from my unit isn’t much different though.</p><p>You guys probably just have too much energy… then you could’ve shared some with me.</p><p>I’m so lacking in stamina that lately, I’ve started to lag behind <em>fine</em>’s lessons. …I don’t wanna be the thing that locks those people in place.</p><p>I didn’t come all the way here to become a burden.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Uh, Senpai? Why did you move your dessert jellies into my lunch box?</p><p>Sure, I was thinking the lunch needs more sweetness, but I’m <em>not</em> a beggar, okay!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, sweets are good for stress, you see.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “That’s right! Build your stamina by eating lots and lots! Promise me this☆”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “… I was wrong to assume these people would have any sense of tact or delicacy.

Welcome back!</p><p>Ohh, so you’re with him, Transfer Student! Good, good! We were lonely thinking you might not show up today! C’mere, come closer♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t beckon her like you would a cat. Pay her proper respect as an equal, a person.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Yeah, Morisawa-senpai can be like <em>that</em>, huh?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I don’t want to hear that from you guys… but I’m just not used to girls. I can’t figure out how to treat them.</p><p>Up until middle school, there were girls in my surroundings. But I didn’t interact with them much…</p><p>I liked playing baseball or the like with my guy friends more than playing with girls.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Huh. Isn’t that okay? … From where I stand, I think you’re blessed to be able to experience an ordinary life like that.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. We both keep asking for something we don’t have, huh?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Haha. You guys have really gotten friendly before I knew it. You forget your shackles so easily… I was like that as a brat too, I think.</p><p>Ah well. Transfer Student, give them <em>that thing</em>.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That thing? What do you mean?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ah, I’m sorry, Sagami-sensei. I got so into my chat with them that I didn’t get around to explaining.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Huh. Well, it’s fine; getting along is your first priority.</p><p>I’ll explain, then. The details of the live show that became our current goal have been mostly finalized. The proposal got officially approved, and they provided us plenty of funds.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Whoa, that’s nice. We’d been thinking so far ahead without sorting ourselves out in the present, I was a bit worried.</p><p>I thought in the worst case scenario, I might need to beg from the president or pay out of my own pocket.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm, you’re helping out of goodwill, Himemiya, so it wouldn’t feel good to burden you with that.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “What are you talking about? It’s enough burden having to give up my precious lunch break every week for this.</p><p>And you seem to forget, but I’m not helping out of goodwill or anything.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah… Right, you were supposed to be the spy the student council president sent.</p><p>Are things going okay? Are you properly giving him the reports he wants?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “The guy I’m spying on is worrying about me… This is such a weird situation.</p><p>I don’t know if President is satisfied, but I’ve been reporting to him on the same day Rain-bows gather.</p><p>Plus, President seems to be investigating from various directions himself, including checking out the magazine where Project-Saga is serialized.</p><p>He said he’s jealous since we seem to be having fun.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah. Surprisingly, this is really fun.</p><p>Since I’m not the leader like I’d be in Ryuuseitai, I think that’s allowed me to loosen up and perform more freely.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I feel the same. Leader, huh… I really don’t feel the position suits me.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “? Rain-bows’s leader is Sagami-sensei, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah no, I became Trickstar’s leader, you see. Just as a formality though; we’re all equal in the group, but…</p><p>My work and responsibility increased. I can’t stay like before.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Huh, well, must be tough to be so weak that you don’t even have enough people for things. You have to take up the position even if you don’t have the right attributes, huh?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “C’mon boys, stop veering off to unrelated topics at every chance. Well, you kids aren’t much different in my classes either, so I’m used to it.</p><p>And you’ll certainly get to learn more by speaking your thoughts plainly and arguing like that, instead of just quietly listening to me talking.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Aah… right. Sorry, that was ill manners.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Sure. Transfer Student, have you finished giving them out? Boys, unwrap the packaging and check it out.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… Ohh, this is—?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ohh! It’s our costumes! So they’ve been completed!”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Eh?—Ah… This is Rain-bows’s costume? For the live?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s impressive, Transfer Student. You weren’t even finished with the design last week, but now you’re done sewing them?</p><p>Come to think of it, you made the Trickstar outfits for us at great speed as well…</p><p>I heard Kiryuu-senpai helped you with those, but you did it all on your own this time, right?</p><p>That’s wonderful. I really do think you have a talent for making costumes.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/jkrAh4C.jpg"></p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Yeah. I thought it was gonna be some pauper-like costume, but this is pretty neat.</p><p>The material seems durable, yet easy to move in? You used a pretty high-end fabric, didn’t you?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/H9n4SiC.jpg"></p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Mmu? What’s wrong, Morisawa-senpai? Is it not to your liking?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ah, no… I think the costume is incredible. But this was made before we got the funds, right?</p><p>You have to properly demand compensation for the material cost, Transfer Student – I’m worried about you providing things at your own expense!</p><p>Also, I was just thinking. This is based on the costume Sagami-sensei used to wear in the past, right?</p><p>I thought I’d seen it somewhere before, so I was wondering for a bit where it was.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah, you can tell? It would’ve been tough to design from scratch, and it’s part of the magazine’s demand…</p><p>They told me to include some elements from the past me, so I asked her to incorporate them in the design.</p><p>But of course, replicating my old costume as-is would look old and lame, so the transfer student touched it up.</p><p>You guys would look fine, but I’m in my thirties already… I can’t wear fancy dazzling clothes made of primary colors. That’s gonna be embarrassing.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. Come to think of it, you wore really vibrant and ostentatious-looking costumes all the time when you were active, Sagami-sensei. Your entire body shining with gold and stuff.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. I had to stand out all on my own, and that’s just the sort of era it was.</p><p>Showbiz’s in a decline, but there are so many big guns with their mindset still stuck in the bubble economy.”</p><h3 id="revival-14">Revival / 14</h3><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, anyway. That costume’s for trial, so the transfer student’ll remake it if there are any problems. Also, she’s saying she’s willing to make more if you guys want?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “No, just these are good enough. Rain-bows is a young unit…</p><p>If we keep changing costumes while our image isn’t fixed yet, the audience may have a hard time remembering us.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah, and it’ll be more burden on the transfer student. She has more work than just making costumes.</p><p>This costume is very polished, so I believe there’s no problem with making this our official unit outfit.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Agreed~ Mine probably needs some adjustments though. Actually, I’ve gotten just a bit thinner since enrolling here…</p><p>So if you made this based on my data from then, it may be a little too big on me.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Mmu? Is that right, Himemiya? You’re dainty enough already… where would you be losing fat?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Yeah, lessons consume a lot of calories – but since I can’t be getting pimples by eating sugar, I’ve been holding back on that.</p><p>Well, figures I’d lose weight eventually.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “That’s not good at all, Himemiya – meat is power! Eat lots and build your stamina! I’ll give you the rest of my lunch ♪</p><p>Actually, this has eggplants here and there so I just couldn’t bring myself to eat it…!”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Don’t push your leftovers on me! I-I’m okay! My body’s always gained fat easily, so I’ll probably restore my weight in no time!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Hahaha. Okaaay, so to sum it up… you guys have no problem with the costume?</p><p>The transfer student just went ahead and finished it before I confirmed the design with you guys, so I was a little worried.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t make it sound like she’s at fault. In fact, praise her for getting the job done fast.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Sure. Good girl. This goes for the rest of you too, but… I’m so amazed at how rapidly the transfer student’s growing. Young’uns have it so nice.</p><p>Anyway, so we have the song and choreography ready through Hidaka’s father’s connections… one of his acquaintances.</p><p>Seeing how our lesson today progressed, we can probably get enough practice no problem until the day of.</p><p>And if the costume also got the OK, well, we can probably hold the live without excess or deficiency. We’ll still have to work on the pre-advertising and practice the fanservice we’ll be doing, though.</p><p>Ah, right. The magazine company did some promotion too, and will bring in audience from outside the school…</p><p>Since Project-Saga is steadily becoming a bigger topic, they said we can expect a good amount of people.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. If we have outsiders in the audience, does that mean it’s become an S1-ranked DreamFest?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No way, it’s nothing of that scale. The academy’s treating it like an official DreamFest, but it’s probably more of a special-case match that’s not bound by the system.</p><p>Just my intuition, but there will probably be more of this type of thing from now on.</p><p>The DreamFest system will probably undergo further transformation, since it doesn’t suit the times we’re in anymore.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Ah, President also said something like that.</p><p>He doesn’t show up at the student council office often, but when he does, he gets into a heated argument about the topic with vice prez each time.</p><p>And looking like they’re enjoying themselves. …the way I am, I can’t get in between those two yet.</p><p>Ah well. Then umm, so the point is, things are proceeding okay? And we just have to give all our effort and focus on perfecting our performance?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “That’s right. But I’ve found a little problem, so I was thinking to consult you guys about it.</p><p>Well, you see~ I’m not sure why either… but there seems to be another unit that wants to join this live.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. How is that a problem?</p><p>It’s not like we wanted to do a solo live no matter what. Having more participants gives it a sense of larger scale, which will help enliven things, right?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “True that! Fans of the other unit will come too; there are loads of good things! We accept any challenger, anytime…☆”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Just where did you guys earn that confidence, when Rain-bows hasn’t achieved anything yet? …well, so anyway, this is where things get funny.</p><p>This unit I’m talking about – Kunugi-sensei formed it.</p><p>And they have a teacher, a third year, a second year, and a first year gathered… as if imitating what we’re doing.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Kunugi-sensei did? I wonder why?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Who knows… Asked him, but he evaded the question. No idea.</p><p>Looking at the unit’s formation, maybe he wants to join Project-Saga too?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. Like, <em>I won’t let Sagami-sensei take all the glory!</em> kind of thing?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “He’s not supposed to be that type of guy. But anyway, it’s totally beyond me why he formed something like that and…</p><p>It’s kinda creepy, so let’s keep our guards up, is what I wanna say.</p><p>Kunugi-sensei’s not being himself. There’s a possibility somebody else made this undesirable suggestion to him.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Somebody… but who could that be? Don’t tell me – a mysterious organization aiming for world domination is brewing a conspiracy in the shadows of Project-Saga!?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nope, totally not. Hey, in these times, if you broadcast that kinda stupid nonsense on TV, the watchers will flame you for making things up.</p><p>But still, there’s something making me reaaaally uneasy about this… I’ll bug Kunugi-sensei some and poke around.</p><p>So that aside. They’re gonna participate in the same live show as us, so we’ll have to make some adjustments to the production to match them.</p><p>They seem to desire a live match, so we’ll have to study their style to plan against them, too.</p><p>In the event of a match, might will become right, but losing means we’ll profit less.</p><p>Project-Saga is supposed to center on <em>us</em>, so it’s gonna be shameful if we lose.</p><p>It’s even possible that… we’ll be excused from the project, and they’ll put Kunugi-sensei’s team in the center as replacement.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “H-Huuh… Well, if that means I won’t have to waste any more time on this stupid project, that’s fine by me—</p><p>But I guess it’ll frustrate me some. I hate losing, so much.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. I feel the same way. Of course, I’ll aim for victory.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. If we can reach a solution by talking it out, that would be best.</p><p>But if necessity calls, we have no choice… it’ll be too pathetic if we head out without any preparation, and end up flattened to the ground.</p><p>We have to use every hand possible to prepare for the battle. May I know what Kunugi-sensei’s unit is like, specifically?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ I don’t have much info on them yet. They’re a temporary unit formed later than us… about two days ago, out of nowhere.</p><p>So far, it seems like they haven’t done anything as a team.</p><p>Using my rights as a teacher, I got to take a look at their formation proposal. Couldn’t pick up more than their unit name and the members, though.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “That’s pretty useful information already. We may be able to estimate the extent of their ability somewhat, if the members are people we know.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay. So err, I’ll start with the unit members. The leader is naturally, Kunugi-sensei.</p><p>Unlike me, he hasn’t stopped polishing himself even after retirement, so he’ll be a formidable enemy.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “It would be a lot easier on us if you hadn’t stopped training too, Sagami-sensei… Well, I guess it’s weird to ask a retiree to keep doing lessons though.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ It wasn’t so long ago that Kunugi-sensei retired. I think he simply hasn’t fallen out of the habit.</p><p>Me, I’ve pretty much forgotten that I used to be an idol.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t forget that. The world remembers even if you forget.”</p><h3 id="revival-15">Revival / 15</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Anyway. So who are the other members of the temporary unit we’re matching up against?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Uuh, I’ll list them in order. The third year is MaM’s Mikejima, the second year is Valkyrie’s Kagehira,</p><p>and the first year is Switch’s… Harukawa? I think. With first years, I can’t immediately recall how the kid looks even hearing their name, sorry.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Ah, if it’s him, we’re in the same class. He seems to be something of a troublemaker; the teachers scold him all the time.</p><p>Well, <em>all</em> the kids in my class are like that~ I’m the only decent one there.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. But Valkyrie aside, I’m not familiar with the other two units…</p><p>Switch – I think that’s the unit Sakasaki from our class made?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm. MaM, or rather Mikejima-san I’m personally close with, so I have a good idea what he’s like.</p><p>He’s an incredibly capable man. Can probably stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Five Oddballs and Tenshouin.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “<em>Haah</em>!? President’s the greatest most excellent strongest top idol there is, okay!?</p><p>… huh, wait? What’s the Five Oddballs? You didn’t mean three?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah… there used to be five of them, so they were called the Five Oddballs.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “They were? It feels like I’ve heard the word before, I guess~?</p><p>So there are two additional guys that are like our unit’s Long Hair? Ueeehh…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. The guy named Sakasaki that I just mentioned was also one of the Five Oddballs.</p><p>If that Harukawa kid is in the same unit as him, that may make him the prized disciple of an Oddball.</p><p>Needless to say, this also applies to Kagehira who’s still part of Valkyrie, the unit that used to reign at the top of Yumenosaki Academy. He has the favors of another of the Five Oddballs, Itsuki Shuu.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah. I’m worried for Itsuki actually, since he hasn’t been coming to school much… but he treasures his comrades a lot, and he excels as a mentor.</p><p>I don’t really know Kagehira’s abilities; or rather, I can’t form an image of him even though I’ve watched Valkyrie’s performances multiple times…</p><p>He’s probably Itsuki’s cherished pupil who’s received his training. We should pay attention to him.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. The team members seemed as though they were picked out at random, but they all share the feeling of being mysterious powerhouses.</p><p>What is Kunugi-sensei planning to do by gathering that kind of people?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Who knows… He fancies himself the bespectacled intellect now, but back in the day, he acted on the fly a lot more than you’d expect.</p><p>It could really be a simple whim.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Hmph. Whatever the opponent’s planning, we just have to make them kneel to us by showing off our power, right?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ooh, you’re so dependable, Himemiya! You won’t even flinch in the face of a strong enemy! You’re so cool♪”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “He-Hehehe… Well, we still can’t let our guard down.</p><p>I don’t wanna get caught off guard just because I underestimated the enemy ever again, so we should probably investigate those guys thoroughly.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “… ah, I forgot to ask. Do those guys have a unit name?</p><p>We can’t keep calling them ‘those guys’, so I want to know their name to start with.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Right. Uhh… the thing is, I dunno how to read it. I wrote it down though; is this English? What’s the pronunciation?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Give it to me. Uhh, so it’s written &lt;Ba-barrier&gt;. You’re right this is difficult to read. Ba… va-ri-a?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Like bavarois? That’s surprisingly cute.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Lo0IDp5.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…♪ (looks at Touri and nods satisfiedly)”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm. I don’t think it’s that. Babari… Bar-ba-ri-an?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Barbarian? That’s a disturbing name. Not idol-like at all.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/NLJlkIZ.jpg"></p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ah, the transfer student’s saying that it may be pronounced like ‘baa-ba-ri-a’!”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “What language is that? Maybe a made-up word… I feel like I’m trying so hard to look deeply into it that I’m starting to draw a blank.</p><p>They probably have better naming sense compared to our cliched ‘Rain-bows’, though.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Well, I’m sure they put some deep meaning into it, but it’s hard to tell from just the letters.</p><p>So if we’re using the transfer student’s pronunciation for now… I see, this Ba-barrier group is our enemy.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. You seem happy, Hidaka; you get fired up when you have an opponent to beat, huh! I get you! Tickles your boyish spirit, doesn’t it ♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. I’m starting to realize after hearing people tell me lately: I may be a more aggressive guy than I thought.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “You’re practically a dog biting at everybody you come across; a feral dog.</p><p>… rather than that, I’m really clueless about Kunugi-sensei. What kind of idol was he before retiring?</p><p>If he’s the leader, he should be the one deciding the content of the unit performance and everything else. If we know his tastes and special skills, we may be able to build the right strategy against him.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay. Before I get to that, I’ll have to lay out an exposition of the history of idols.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “<em>Why</em>. Lunch break’s going to end soon, so we don’t have time to listen to your long speech.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Just hear me out here. It’s hard to explain what sort of idol Kunugi-sensei was.</p><p>He has a half-baked work history too, so I’d feel bad if he doesn’t get proper evaluation because of it.</p><p>This is part of Project-Saga’s goal anyway, so you guys should know at least the basic outline of the industry’s history.</p><p>It’s the old man’s favorite nostalgia time; sit tight and listen… Sagami-sensei is starting a class♪”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “We’re in your care! Ahh, this is great! To think I would hear the facts of history directly from a person who lived through it…☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m not very interested. The past is the past, and we live in the present.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Yup. The future’s the most important anyway.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “And that present and future of yours are continued from the past, okay? There seems to be someone scheming something behind this project—</p><p>And their reason for action is likely deeply rooted in the past. If not, they wouldn’t have staged a revival of retired idols after all this time.</p><p>I’m decrepit and my vision is blurry; I can’t get a clear view on what we’re getting wrapped up in.</p><p>But if I fill you guys in on the background knowledge you don’t have and see things from a new point of view, I may be able to pick up on things I didn’t before.</p><p>In the entertainment industry, the murky past gets hushed up and fades with the passage of time until it’s completely forgotten…</p><p>But I wouldn’t know what to say to the predecessors that way, so I wanna pass on the stories when it’s possible.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I understand! Kamen R*der also periodically does recaps of past series to remind us of history!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Stop relating everything to tokusatsu. …well, that doesn’t matter; I’ll give you a simple summary of the history of the idol industry.</p><p>First, there was one idol. Put bluntly, he was like God. He created all the things that became the foundation of the present idol business.</p><p>Here’s an example. There was a year-end festival that used to center mostly on general celebrities and musicians, where idols were included only as accessories…</p><p>…and somehow, he managed to transform it into an event completely by idols and for idols.</p><p>That’s SS, which is still being held even now.</p><p>He also caused countless other revolutions, large and small. Before, idols were just part of the broad definition of musician…</p><p>…like a niche branch, but he made the industry flourish and prosper like its own genre.</p><p>Before that, of course there were people who referred to themselves as idols, or got referred to as one…</p><p>… but he singularized the existence known as an idols, redefining them into a special presence different from the rest.</p><p>The word ‘idol’ carried entirely different connotations before and after that person appeared.</p><p>This is difficult to understand for people who weren’t there to witness it; it’s from before I was born too, so I’m just repeating what my seniors told me.</p><p>But it seems he really changed <em>everything</em>. History was stirred, and the world was overturned completely at the hands of a single person—</p><p>Compared to the achievements that person left behind, what I pulled off has no worth at all.”</p><h3 id="revival-16">Revival / 16</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Did such a person really exist? I can’t believe it so easily; it sounds like some exaggerated legend to me.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, figures. Rumors always come with exaggerated details.</p><p>Nobody can say what really happened except the people who actually lived through the change.</p><p>Anyway, it may sound like a myth, which may or may not contain historical truth…</p><p>But that person <em>did</em> exist, and he retained a strong influence even in his later life.</p><p>He was active for a long time as an idol, and became a magnate who controlled the industry from the shadows upon retirement, I heard. Well, this is also pretty much an urban legend.</p><p>Apparently, when I was active, that person was still holding on, just barely…</p><p>…and he stretched out his tentacles to many fields outside the idol industry, reigning over everything from the shadows and in the light.</p><p>Like a ringleader of the industry, a Godfather. …I guess kids these days don’t know a movie that old anymore?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…I might’ve heard of him before. His name often turned up in social parties; it seems he also had a strong power over the stock market.</p><p>Yeah. The timeline matches up, I think. Since you said it was when you were active, that means about ten years ago, right, Sagami-sensei?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yep. I retired at around 22 years old, so roughly around that time. Huh, I was skeptical too, but…</p><p>I guess someone like that could’ve existed for real; someone with such outrageous power.</p><p>So anyway, that was the dawn of history. The root of the current idol business, of the present.</p><p>The Genesis, if this were the Bible. The part where God said, <em>Let there be light</em>.</p><p>So <em>Let there be idols</em>, in his case? That person was obsessively in love with idols.</p><p>All so idols would be elevated to greater heights, so their domain would spread even wider—</p><p>So the masses would acknowledge them, seek for them— He did everything in his power for that, even on his deathbed.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “… that’s just like Eichi-sama.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn? Did you say something, Himemiya?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Ah, nothing… But he’s gone, right? Doesn’t that mean he has practically nothing to do with us?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “The thing is, not necessarily. That person’s power and treasury were divvied up to various factions and handed down over time… They became the pillars of the current business.</p><p>There were also many idols that kinda took on his position as a godlike, monumental idol.</p><p>I heard rumors about how SS was, put bluntly, an event to search for someone to assume that position.</p><p>Since long ago when that person was alive— no, since the time when he was still active, he had always sought for someone suitable to succeed his position.</p><p>Well, that goal’s been lost, and SS has simply become a ‘fancy annual festival’.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Oi. Don’t say something that would make me lose my motivation for SS; I’m a participant.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahaha. Well, SS is still <em>the</em> largest-scale festival held by the idol industry, be it now or back then…</p><p>It may have lost its original purpose somewhat, but its value has never fallen.</p><p>The number of fans looking forward to the event has in fact increased compared to when that person was active. And as long as the fans are happy, that’s an idol’s justice, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. Well, you’re right.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I am. Anyway, that person… the original super idol retired and disappeared from the stage.</p><p>After that, he kept controlling things from the shadows, exercising more power than anyone had the right to…</p><p>…but that brought the need for someone else to stand on stage in his place.</p><p>An advertisement tower; a totem; the face of the industry that everyone would immediately think of when they heard the word idol.</p><p>He needed the next super idol.</p><p>That’s why after he vanished from the stage, a single man… a super idol would be placed to stand there, substituted again with each era.</p><p>With that person’s support, generation after generation of super idol shone intensely as the sun of the business.</p><p>Their fans would undergo change with the times, but they would unchangingly entertain them and gain their love.</p><p>Such a blissful period continued, for a long time.</p><p>A lone super idol rose from the horizon high into the sky and sank again; this circle repeated.</p><p>It wasn’t always smooth sailing, even if each period was blessed with an excellent super idol who suited the title.</p><p>But the original super idol was so great, none of them could hold onto the position for long, or so I heard.</p><p>Apparently, there were even dangerous times where the super idols kept getting switched out for new ones without even a year passing.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…I feel like I’m listening to a lecture about the emperors of Ancient Rome.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah, I think your impression is about right.</p><p>Some godlike existence founded an empire, and era after era… an emperor was appointed by the god to reign for a period.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “The divine right of kings was a story made up by later Rome; a political doctrine, but… I know what you’re trying to say.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Huh, if it’s anything like the Roman Empire, keeping the people ignorant for easier rule eventually became the norm and backfired.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Right. That’s not off the mark, in fact, but we’ll talk about that later.</p><p>Anyway, so that’s the history of the idol industry. There were good times and bad times.</p><p>As an example of the good times, we can take a look at Hidaka’s dad’s era.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…what, my father?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Hey, what’s with that fed up look on your face each time your parents get brought up? Your dad is an incredible man… Respect him more, kid.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…I <em>do</em> respect him – the minimum amount necessary.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Haha. Must be hard for the Hidaka couple, their only son being stuck in a rebellious phase.</p><p>Anyway, your father being the top idol of a past era is historical fact.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. That’s what troubles me; his light is too bright.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Y’know, you say some strangely smart things lately.</p><p>Well anyway, so while Hidaka dad was reigning, there were no big problems in the idol industry.</p><p>The world prospered, the people submitted to joy and bliss, and everything was radiant with light.</p><p>Until <em>a certain person</em> appeared, the super idols more or less did their part well.</p><p>At the very least, it was unthinkable for a situation that could turn over the entire industry to happen.</p><p>Because the original super idol set it up to be that kind of system.</p><p>But the times were rapidly changing,. Even with the strings that person pulled from the shadows and the super idols doing their best, they couldn’t catch up with the world anymore.</p><p>With every moment, the state of the world underwent transformation; there were many eye-opening technological discoveries just in the media…</p><p>Even a system created by an ultimate genius couldn’t survive the stormy waves of that era unscathed. It was showing its age, really.</p><p>That’s when the case of ‘that Akehoshi’ happened.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah… So that certain person you mentioned really was—”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “—‘That Akehoshi’, huh?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Eh? Eh? What’s ‘that Akehoshi’ about? Who? Akehoshi is that overloud and obnoxious guy in Trickstar, right?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “… not <em>that</em> Akehoshi, even if he’s not unrelated. Well, don’t look too deeply into it. It’s all in the past.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. Anyway, so as that person reached a tragic end, the idol business also fell into dark times.</p><p>Nothing would go well, society spat on us and turned its back; it was a dark, cold period that nobody in the industry wants to look back on, probably.</p><p>The super idols had shone like sparkling stars, but the curtain had to fall on the radiant times they’d sustained and amassed.</p><p>The idols’ golden era is nothing more than a ghost of the past, something only depicted in mythology or history now.</p><p>The winter is still going on, even now. A lot of time has passed since that case happened, we’re entering a new generation, and everybody’s starting to forget…</p><p>But the system that supported the idol business is busted; we’re just hanging by a thread, barely managing to slow down our ruin.”</p><h3 id="revival-17">Revival / 17</h3><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “… it’s exactly because we’re living in such cold times – that your existence as the idol who restored the lost radiance to the industry even for just a moment was like a miracle, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. I probably shouldn’t be saying this about myself, but it probably was a miracle. But miracles are called miracles because they don’t happen that often.</p><p>I worked real hard and managed to prolong its life some, but this business is suffering from a fatal wound.</p><p>We can’t do anything about it. It went right back to where it started as soon as I retired anyway.</p><p>It’s <em>really</em> weird to say this about myself, but I was the last super idol.</p><p>After that, the industry was just overrun by a disorderly mob; with no super idol to lead them, nor any of them achieving enough to rise as the next one…</p><p>Like Himemiya said, it pretty much became an era of the ignorant masses.</p><p>That original super idol passed away, too. There’s no one to stand at the top, the magnate who would support the industry’s gone from the world…</p><p>Now it’s just filled with robbers scavenging for ancient relics and treasures in chaotic ruins that nobody rules. That’s the sort of sad time we live in.</p><p>What do people call this stuff again? Post-apocalypse?</p><p>I mean, when I watched a movie with that catchphrase, I seriously went ‘Wow, it’s the idol business’ in my head.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “The world after the end, a post-apocalypse… Are we really in such a horrible times? I personally don’t want to think that way.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, I feel like I exaggerated some things there. But in summary yeah, that’s the present we’re in.</p><p>Going back to our original topic; Kunugi-sensei was somebody who was born to such wintry times…</p><p>… and had the bad luck of appearing after the Super Idol Sagami Jin, the industry’s first bright topic in a long while.</p><p>It’s not so strange he’d seem duller in comparison.</p><p>He had passion, and maybe about the same amount of talent as I did. But he couldn’t bud because he was born to the wrong times.</p><p>It was a wasteland with no sign of life; no flower could’ve bloomed there.</p><p>The momentary boom I brought seemed to attract some sort of movement trying to revive the industry and make it prosper again…</p><p>… but that also caused the mechanisms and the mood of the business to be constantly on the change.</p><p>Nobody could’ve made the best out of their gifts. Plus, he went so far as to discover some admiration for me, becoming fixated on an outdated mindset…</p><p>So the constant shifting of the times threw him in for a loop, and after a long while of clinging onto the business, he had to retire with an unsatisfactory track record.</p><p>Which made him who he is. He’s gone through a lot – much more than I have.</p><p>He’s the studious type, so he’s knowledgeable on the golden era of idols.</p><p>And he has experienced those dark times that were much like a bubbling witch’s cauldron… he’s a living witness of it.</p><p>He knows the bitter and the sweet. And he’s been unrewarded despite his great efforts; he’s got a taste of failures and how irrational things can be.</p><p>That’s why he’s fit to be a teacher.</p><p>I doubt anyone wants to hear me bragging about my past, and honestly it’s worth nothing in these times—</p><p>But his stories of failures and hardships are the sort of tragedy the world still overflows with.</p><p>He just doesn’t want the kids to repeat the same mistakes he did.</p><p>Probably. That’s why when he says ‘<em>Don’t come this way!</em>’, it probably really <em>does</em> mean that way’s doomed.</p><p>That’s something I can’t tell you; hard facts only Kunugi-sensei, as someone who couldn’t become a super idol, can teach.</p><p>So children, lend an ear to what Kunugi-sensei tells you. Well, both Kunugi-sensei and I are still relics of the past, maybe even ghosts…</p><p>At the end of the day, you guys who are living through the present in real time should think with your head and choose the path you wanna live on your own.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I see.

I thought you might misjudge him if you don’t know firsthand what his standing was in history and what sort of times he lived through.</p><p>He’s got a mediocre track record and I often joke about it…</p><p>But I want you to know he had every capability to succeed; that he didn’t was the fault of the times he lived in.</p><p>In fact, since he was from a time when the entire idol industry was struggling desperately to pull through…</p><p>He’s far richer in experience than I am.</p><p>Unlike me, he formed a unit, and he also had to work as a comedian for some time.</p><p>Sure, he’s evaluated about average in pretty much all those fields, save for singing – thanks to having that pretty voice as a weapon – and gravure.</p><p>But that conversely means he’s <em>at least</em> average in everything.</p><p>He’s an all-rounder; so if you only build a strategy to deal with his singing 'cause you think that’s what he’s good at, you’re prolly in for a painful experience.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Does that mean there’s no way to plan against him? Then what was this long talk for…?</p><p>Well, I did learn a lot of facts I didn’t know before.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yup. I said in the beginning, didn’t I? That I’m gonna ‘start a class’. So if you learned, that’s great.</p><p>I know it’s annoying having to sit through a middle-aged guy rambling about the past, but somebody’s gotta pass on this stuff.</p><p>They’re nothing so noble or pretty as to be called heroic epics, but…</p><p>It’s the history of the world I offered up my youth for, the same world you guys are currently living in.</p><p>You won’t lose anything from hearing about it.

That’s why he’s called that way…</p><p>Is he planning to become a greater existence, to stand at the top as a ‘super idol’, and bring the radiant golden era back to the idol industry?</p><p>No? Eichi-sama doesn’t seem to like being called Emperor, does he…?</p><p>Of course. Lowering the curtain on the old era to make a new world… so <em>fine</em>.</p><p>If it’s Eichi-sama, he can definitely reach greater heights than those many super idols in history.</p><p>He can become as great an existence as that godlike ‘original super idol’, or maybe something more.</p><p>No, he’s definitely working hard for that already…</p><p>Sagami-sensei only explained the broad scope of history, so I don’t have a grasp on the current state of affairs.</p><p>Like I got to study world history but only left with a vague idea on contemporary history.

The magazines will make me into another showy headline: ‘<em>The Sparkling Prince, Fattens Like a Pig After Becoming an Idol!?</em>’”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I think you worry too much~ Y’know, you look like somebody who’ll go bald with age.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I won’t!

And <em>very</em> soundly at that! We can’t have that; please tidy up so we can hurry to the stage!</p><p>The live show is starting!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay… Sorry, Akiyan.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “… Akiyan? No, umm, I am the burning heart Morisawa Chiaki, as you can see!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. <em>All</em> of you gotta stop attaching that kind of aliases to names, it’s not cool… Sorry, Morisawa, I think I was delirious.</p><p>I see now. I’ve been thinking for the longest time that you resemble someone – so it was the young Kunugi-sensei, huh.</p><p>You’re both dreadfully serious, for one. Be careful so you won’t go bald in the future.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “? No, everyone in my family should be fine, based on our genes…?</p><p>Rather than that! The show is going to start anytime now, so for the hundredth time, let’s hurry over there!</p><p>The people waiting there might panic if you never show up!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Oh right. Sorry, sorry. I guess I’ve really regressed, after all… In the past, I might have complained all the time, but I always made sure to be punctual.</p><p>Seems I couldn’t get rid of the exhaustion and ended up fast asleep as soon as I closed my eyes.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha. That makes you sound like an old man, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I <em>am</em> an old man, compared to you guys. What gives? Don’t I feel more like a mentor that way?</p><p>Huff… Ah~ my joints are hurting because I slept in a weird position.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Are you all right? Please loosen up your joints as much as you can before the show, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “It’s fine, it’s fine. Don’t worry about me like that, I’ll do my part.</p><p>And I <em>do</em> have motivation. Maybe even more than back when I was active, 'cause I don’t wanna drag the team down and cause trouble for you kids.</p><p>…haha. You have to think about stuff like that when you’re in a unit, huh?</p><p>It’s a refreshing experience, really. Like I’ve been born anew; I wish we had that kinda system during my era.</p><p>…oops, we gotta hurry, right? Wait a sec, I’ll go shave. Can’t greet the audience looking dirty.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha. I didn’t expect you to care so much for style, Sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “‘Somebody near me fussed over appearances all the time. He got on my case almost every single day, so I grew to care about it too, just a bit.’”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “That person was Kunugi-sensei, right? Don’t you have complicated feelings about having to go up against somebody like that, Sagami-sensei?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nope, not ooone bit. The idol trade is a killing game; we’ve got to mercilessly crush anybody who opposes us.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ew, scary… It must’ve been a bloodthirsty era back then, compared to now.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “It hasn’t changed, right? This is a competitive society, we can’t reach the goal by all holding hands together.</p><p>You’re a kind boy, Morisawa. It must be hard for you to live in a world like this.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn? What’s wrong? I’m gonna take a little more time preparing so you can go ahead to the location. Look after your juniors, third-year.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “… Sensei, there is something I have been meaning to ask.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn? What is it? Aren’t we in a hurry right now…? If it’s something difficult, can we leave it for later?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “No, umm… you’re right. Then, I will ask later.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “… I take that back; I’m curious so tell me. You’re wearing a serious look, so I’m guessing it’s important.</p><p>There’s still some time until the show opens, right? What do you wanna ask, Morisawa?</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ah, okay… This is a little difficult to ask, but may I know why you quit being an idol, Sagami-sensei?</p><p>We’ve been able to work together as Rain-bows for Project-Saga, something I am very thankful for… but I have been watching you, and you looked like you were having fun the whole time.</p><p>You love singing and dancing, right?</p><p>Despite usually being lazy, you took the harsh training more seriously than anyone… and it must be all because you love it, right?</p><p>So why? Sensei, why did you let go of what you loved doing?</p><p>Please don’t gloss over it by saying ‘a brat wouldn’t get it’; can you please tell me the truth… Sensei?</p><p>I’m afraid. Afraid of eventually growing to hate what I love.</p><p>I’d thought many times that the heroes on TV were liars… and almost resented them for it.</p><p>But I embrace them in the end, because I love them, after all.</p><p>But will even that feeling… eventually fade and disappear?</p><p>I’d hate for that to happen – even the thought of it scares me. I can’t put it well but… is that just how it is, Sensei?</p><p>Will the things that engrossed me as a child not matter to me anymore, once I become an adult?</p><p>If so, then am I doing something incredibly pointless by chasing after it with all my life right now…?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Morisawa.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ah, yes! What is it, sir?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I’m a school teacher and not your parent <em>nor</em> your counselor. To be blunt, I’m not here to provide the answer to your teenage angst.</p><p>However. You’re a pretty good guy, so I <em>do</em> want to spare you some advice if I can.</p><p>Nah, I should at least show you <em>what not to be</em>, since I haven’t set a good example like a real teacher would.</p><p>You know, I’m… yeah, I loved idols. It was my dream. My first love was fond of them, and that inspired me to become one.</p><p>Sounds like I was a dumb brat, right? Just like you.</p><p>But where my blood and sweat took me was an idol industry that had already rotted.</p><p>The radiant, golden era was past, and the world that I had dreamed of, that the person I loved had dreamed of, was over.</p><p>It was a world that had already ended. The dirty and greedy adults used me to their convenience… Battered and exhausted, I got soiled to the soul.</p><p>I just stopped caring.</p><p>So I did a lot of impulsive things, you see. I was desperate, so I didn’t care what would happen as a result.</p><p>Some saw it as me standing up against the rotten industry and fighting.</p><p>But that was just me blowing myself up. Attacking an enormous enemy expecting them to take me down. To be frank, I never thought for a moment that I could reform anything.</p><p>I was a powerless, spoiled brat kicking up a fuss and bawling his eyes out because he couldn’t take it. I hated it all so much, I couldn’t hold it in, so I was venting my stress.</p><p>Yet the idol industry didn’t desert me. I was their breadwinner, the only one. Who would let go of a hen that laid golden eggs?</p><p>So my actions only escalated. I started testing to see how much they would be willing to forgive me for.</p><p>Drank, smoked, played around with girls.</p><p>Despite that, they let me run wild for a while. Heck, the idol industry even did their best to protect such a worthless guy.</p><p>They got rid of scandals, manipulated information, and lied to people.</p><p>I hated it all the more, seeing that. I’m unsalvageable trash, the world I live in is rotten, there are no such things as hopes or dreams…</p><p>That’s what I thought. It tasted like despair.</p><p>That didn’t last long, though. They weighed the loss they would have to suffer by keeping a troublemaker like me around, against the profit I could make them as an idol—</p><p>Eventually the scale fell on the former, and they cast me aside.</p><p>Even at the end, they made up some bull as my reason for retirement and made it into a peaceful sendoff,</p><p>but what really happened was, I was trash who ruined myself for everybody to see. The idol industry couldn’t defend me anymore, and cut me off.</p><p>Nothing beautifully dramatic about it.</p><p>Humans, you see… When they achieve success by accident without knowing the reason behind it… they go mad.</p><p>I think I was out of my mind then. Deranged, and got myself wiped out as a result.</p><p>It’s a story you’d find anywhere.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…”</p><h3 id="revival-22">Revival / 22</h3><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/GFNRzYD.jpg"></p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “But y’know, now I think it was definitely a misunderstanding on my part – the belief that everything was rotten.</p><p>I was a dumb brat with a narrow outlook, who couldn’t see reality properly—</p><p>But Akiyan was always by my side, supporting me. I think the other kids from school were simply, purely, rooting for me too.</p><p>I met a lot of people worthy of respect among those I worked with.</p><p>And even though I did, in fact, do a bunch of things I shouldn’t have…</p><p>The originator of Project-Saga – the gramps from the magazine company – believed that ‘<em>It must be a mistake!</em>’ and fought in my defense till the end.</p><p>I was just an ingrate covering my own eyes. …so I want to repay the love and favors that were given to me.</p><p>Many fans sent me letters and flower bouquets upon retirement. During the press conference where I announced it, I saw a bunch of adults bawling their eyes out.</p><p>They told me… <em>I love you, I admire you, I could live on thanks to you</em>.</p><p>And I think those words and feelings couldn’t have been all lies. Humans aren’t such worthless living beings.</p><p>The trash is probably only a small minority – and I’m included.</p><p>It was only after I couldn’t turn back, after I retired, that I realized…</p><p>Only after everything was over that I realized, what a cruel thing I’d done.</p><p>I betrayed all their faith and affection.</p><p>I was loved, yet I was selfishly convinced that I was alone in a rotten world, and self-destructed all because I couldn’t bear it.</p><p>I should’ve hung in there and gritted my teeth. As long as somebody, even just one person, still loved me.</p><p>… but I couldn’t. That was the end of it, that was everything.</p><p>This is gonna sound like an excuse, but an industry isn’t something for a lone youth to bear on their shoulders.</p><p>Not everybody can manage what that original super idol that I talked to you about did.</p><p>Humans can’t become gods. That person was the true miracle; the product of an impossible coincidence.</p><p>There’s no way we can copy someone like that.</p><p>In the end, idols are idols – not God himself.</p><p>The old system of the idol industry, centered on a super idol who stood lonely at the top, wouldn’t work in the present; things have gotten a lot more complicated.</p><p>But everyone has clung onto it… ceased thinking and kept repeating the past, leaving the idol industry in its current hopeless state.</p><p>That’s why, now’s probably when a revolution is really needed. The buds have been poking out in places, slowly but steadily, since Kunugi-sensei’s time.</p><p>It’s because a super idol doesn’t exist in these times that a system that wouldn’t rely on super idols is getting brought to life.</p><p>I think things are heading in a good direction, so… I’m rooting for you kids.</p><p>The conception of the Five Oddballs, and Tenshouin’s revolution, seemed to me like nothing more but a reimagination of that ancient super idol system.</p><p>So to be honest, I couldn’t like it;</p><p>the mindset that a lone person or the chosen few had to bear <em>everything</em>. I knew from experience that it was impossible… or at least incredibly difficult.</p><p>But, I probably underestimated Tenshouin’s group. It was probably just part of the process.</p><p>The policies born from back then, like the unit system, are now laying the groundwork for the coming era.</p><p>We can’t do it alone. Then, just support the industry together with everyone.</p><p>Lean on your teammates and share the load.</p><p>That’s what units are for, right? It isn’t just about pulling down powerful individuals by giving them a weakness in the shape of ‘other people’.</p><p>Probably. Though it seems the system was misused for that purpose during the subjugation-or-whatever of the Five Oddballs.</p><p>But the true goal was like I mentioned, right? The people, and not a god, supporting society as its center.</p><p>That fortifies it better. Even if one person gets crushed, another will take their place, so the system renews itself and holds out for longer.</p><p>The value of powerful individuals falls, but that means there’s a chance for smaller forces to polish each other as they compete for the top.</p><p>It gives a stability, a balance of power. There won’t be a danger of the entire industry toppling over just because an individual went a little berserk, like during my time.</p><p>Instead of having a lone dictator at the lead, present society is about people making the world go 'round by putting their power together.</p><p>The world has long changed, and now the idol industry’s finally catching up with it.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/XgHE7uo.jpg"></p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “… fufu. I thought you were so committed to your retired life that you’d closed off your eyes and ears completely, but it seems you’ve been watching us closely, sir.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Of course. I’m your teacher, it’s my job to watch over my students.</p><p>Maaaybe? I ended up rambling while shaving; I hope I’m not getting a razor rash…</p><p>Let’s just head out already; I’m a tad nervous since it’s my first appearance onstage in a long time.</p><p>But I’m a retired idol, so it wouldn’t be anything weird if I failed, I guess. Sorry if I slip up, you guys better cover for me when I do. …I’m counting on you, Morisawa.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yes. Unlike when you were active, Sagami-sensei, you have teammates now. You have <em>us</em>, so please rest easy.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “… cheeky brat. Ah well, I’m glad you seem to have taken my talk well.</p><p>You’re still a kid, so maybe you get anxious sometimes.</p><p>You became a third year before you knew it, stuck with the duty to look cool in front of your juniors… and maybe you can’t show them a weak side.</p><p>So. If you get any more of these worries in the future, just come to talk to me in secret. If a lousy old man’s hard-luck story is what you seek, I’m more than happy to answer.</p><p>But seriously, I think you brats are gonna be fine. Just my intuition – but the era’s changed, after all.</p><p>When things get unbearable, look around you, don’t suffer alone. Keep that in mind, if you don’t want to lose your mind and get crushed like I did.</p><p>You’re not alone. As long as <em>you</em> don’t avert your eyes from it, your love will bear fruit. Somebody will love you back. Don’t forget that.</p><p>And 'cause you’re not alone, you’ll be fine. Even without becoming God, saving the world is a piece of cake.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Understood. That’s the legendary hero, Ryuusei Rainbow for you… You mean to say that I just have to recall Ryuuseitai’s catchphrase when I face hard times, right?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “? What catchphrase?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Huh, don’t you know? No, of course you do, right?</p><p>After all, it was said the old Ryuuseitai took it as their catchphrase after you said it on your tokusatsu show, Sagami-sensei!</p><p>I love it so I say it often too – <em>One for all, all for one!</em>”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahh… Bluntly speaking, I stole that from <em>The Three Musketeers</em>. You should know since you’re a bookworm, Morisawa.</p><p>Ah well. I was a bit worried, actually…</p><p>Morisawa, you said you admired me, right? So I wondered if you wanted to become a super idol.</p><p>But that’s not it, huh? What you wanted to be, it was a hero all along.”</p><p>(Haha. Even if it doesn’t strike a chord with me, I guess it’s not bad to read out from scripts sometimes.</p><p>There are people who will listen earnestly, be moved and let it ring inside their heart.</p><p>Aah, I wish I could tell my old self. I wanna give him a talking to: ‘Wow, you’re such an idiot!’</p><p>‘You couldn’t see what was all around you, and thought you were bearing the burden of everything on your own.’</p><p>But too late for that, and it’s also thanks to that past that I’m here now.</p><p>Guess I should at least break my back to turn the youth and future of these kids into something brighter.</p><p>I’m a schoolteacher, so I gotta act like one sometimes.</p><p>About that much is what’s befitting of a mere man.

It’s our first live as Rain-bows, so I guess even you can’t hide your nervousness?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “<em>H-Haah</em>? As if I would ever get nervous! Can you stop taking me for a fool!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m not. I’m worried for you, Himemiya.</p><p>You’re a first year, so you’re probably unused to doing live shows. I haven’t seen <em>fine</em> doing many idol activities since their defeat in DDD, either.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Whose fault do you think that is… You really tick me off.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. Maybe saying this will just make you even angrier with me, but – I apologize for hurting you.</p><p>But I never thought for a moment that I should’ve lost back during DDD.</p><p>We gave our everything for what we wanted to do; you guys and me both. We fought for our dreams, and this was the result.</p><p>We can’t change that past, no matter how hard we pray.</p><p>…Last year, I stood on the mop-up stage of the student council president’s, <em>fine</em>’s, revolution and experienced a cruel defeat at their hands.</p><p>You weren’t <em>fine</em> yet, so maybe you don’t know.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Ah… I would usually be in the audience as a fan of <em>fine</em>, so I might know.</p><p>Come to think of it, I think I saw someone like you on the old <em>fine</em>’s last stage.

I think it was buchou’s way of being considerate.</p><p>If I hid myself behind a mask and an alias, even if the people onstage and the audience remembered me…</p><p>People in the future who can only learn from the records won’t know who I was.</p><p>Maybe buchou did that so I wouldn’t have to suffer a huge scratch on my track record while he got me wrapped up in a tragic battle we couldn’t win.</p><p>Well, it could simply be because he thought ‘it’s funnier that way’ too.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…that stuff matters even less. What are you trying to say, Hidaka-senpai?’</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right. To be honest, that defeat frustrated me immensely.

So you’re saying you weren’t obliged to be loyal to <em>fine</em> since they did something cruel to you? That you were justified in betraying us?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s not it.

We should be friends because we’re so alike?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s not it either. We don’t have to be friends; Rain-bows is just something thrown together for Project-Saga.</p><p>If you can’t fit in, you’re free to go; nobody will stop you.</p><p>You don’t have to put your life on the line, either. But I also don’t want you to think you’re wasting your time. I mean, that’s not what I want to say… it’s more… uuh.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “… okay, okay. So you’re a terrible speaker, Senpai, I got it.</p><p>I thought I could act the stubborn brat and get through this without you and I having to communicate.</p><p>But then you’re going to keep bothering me and that’s a lot of hassle, so I’ll catch on. I’ll say <em>Yes, I understand</em>. Be thankful.</p><p>So, because <em>you</em> used your personal grudges as your driving force, persevered without giving in, and got what you wanted as a result… I can <em>and</em> should do the same?

Especially back when Trickstar was just formed.

That maybe I was doing something stupid…</p><p>That maybe nobody was wishing for this, maybe I was kicking up a fuss just because I was bitter over having been hurt.</p><p>Maybe, I’d made a mess over something silly, dragging my friends down with me…</p><p>I talked big about it being a revolution, but maybe I was a scoundrel disturbing the peace of many in vain.</p><p>Maybe it was all true.

I wanted, <em>begged</em> to be let into <em>fine</em>.</p><p>It might’ve been part of his ploy, but President himself chose to make you one of us. He scouted you, told you he wanted you.</p><p>He never told that to me. So I was frustrated, and I despised you for throwing away the thing I wanted so easily; I didn’t get you.</p><p>I still don’t.

You probably can’t see with your small frame, so come closer.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “… Hidaka-senpai, you really are like a prince.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Mm? Really? Thanks, Himemiya, I’m confident in my acting as a prince if nothing else.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “It’s definitely not acting – you don’t even realise that you’re doing it. Ticks me off… Dense and oblivious, but optimistic and strong.</p><p>It makes me look stupid for acting all sharp and aggressive to you.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What? I can’t hear if you mumble like that; there’s a bigger crowd gathered than I imagined and it’s really loud.</p><p>Hehe, since I can hear you better if our faces are closer, should I carry you in my arms like a princess?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Worry about yourself. So your ears pick up compliments and nothing else, huh? I haaate that side of you to death, along with everything else.</p><p>… I’ll make you suffer one day, Prince.”</p><h3 id="revival-25">Revival / 25</h3><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/J8BZORB.jpg"></p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Oo~i. I’m done changing. Sorry I got here late.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. Reflect on it. Since that Ba-barrier group haven’t shown up either, we were worried that <em>we</em> might’ve been the ones who got the time wrong.</p><p>Well, Himemiya and I ad-libbed a comedy skit during the waiting time, so there haven’t been any problems.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/YQ4MHOF.jpg"></p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “There’s been nothing <em>but</em> problems… Ahh, I so want to go home, get in bed, sleep and make this all a dream. I want to forget that I ever did <em>that</em> in front of Eichi-sama—”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha. Did you two make up while we were gone?</p><p>Glad to see you’re enjoying yourselves; and you even kept the guests entertained while waiting for us to get here, that’s wonderful♪”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Haha. Still, it sure is embarrassing… for <em>me</em> to stand on stage wearing an idol outfit, in front of a crowd this large. Why are there so many people in the audience, anyway?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah, there are more people than I expected. Did the magazine company behind Project-Saga work hard on the promotion?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I don’t think magazines make for such a good promotion method these days.</p><p>Mr. Writer came to cheer for us today – I heard from him that we became a hot topic on the net.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/d2QoBOC.jpg"></p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Mr. Writer… ah, he’s right beside Anzu. So I heard he’s still a student?</p><p>And he’s in the company due to some connection with a big shot there, and not even a company employee, but a part-time worker?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah, that’s what I heard too. Actually, Project-Saga’s popularity went beyond even his expectations, and that seemed to have scared him – he looked white as sheet.</p><p><em>If</em> there is some conspiracy behind Project-Saga, Mr. Writer’s the most obvious suspect due to being a mole from the magazine,</p><p>but based on that attitude, he might really be a clueless errand boy.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “You’re still suspicious of something like that, Sagami-sensei?</p><p><em>Innocent until proven guilty</em> is the standard in the legal world, right? Mr. Writer’s a good guy who worked earnestly for our sake… let’s have more faith in him.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I’m not accusing him, and I have faith in his character. It’s just his exact type of ‘earnest, good kids’ are the ones most easily manipulated by bad adults.</p><p>You guys – and the transfer student too – are pretty much the same type, so be careful. In these times, we can’t just assume that there’s kindness to be found everywhere.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Mmu, now he’s rebuking <em>us</em>. I didn’t even say a thing…</p><p>Anyway, isn’t having a big audience a good thing for idols? What are you complaining about?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Children are so nice and simple, eh? I should learn from your example, Himemiya; it’s just as you said.</p><p>Project-Saga’s popularity could simply be because it fits with the demands of the times.</p><p>We’re currently a super-ageing society, with young people being the minority, so the elderly with a fondness for nostalgia may make up the largest part of the market.</p><p>So instead of sparkling new idols with unexplored sides, it’s the nostalgic, retired ones that rake in more audience and money. What a distasteful time…</p><p>The magazine company, or rather that bigwig who commissioned this project, foresaw that trend, huh?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha. Come to think of it, we’ve been having a revival boom, haven’t we? I’m personally happy about it, as it gives people a chance to get to know old titles.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nah… we old men prefer to see you young’uns work hard and open up a completely new world, ya know?</p><p>Being stuck with a view that never changes is the same as dying… so you guys gotta give it your all today.</p><p>Surprise the crowd gathered here and make them say ‘Wow, these kids are way more awesome than Sagami Jin!’ Swallow me up, use me as a stepping stone and walk ahead.</p><p>When we’re done with Project-Saga, I’ll be retired once and for all… watching you guys thrive as I live out the rest of my life in pleasure; that’s my plan.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You keep acting like you’re old… but you’re still young, Sensei.</p><p>Look, some of the guests are glancing at you and saying ‘Who’s that boy? A newbie? He’s so cool~♪’”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha. Sensei, you really do look a lot younger after getting rid of that stubble.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Yeah. You should make sure to look that tidy every other day, too.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Eh~ What a pain… But based on the murmurs I heard from the audience, I guess most of the people gathered don’t even know what this stage is about?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Since we don’t plan on spending much of it anyway, we just ignored profit altogether, and set a very low price for the tickets…</p><p>Plus, we don’t even know if we will have a ‘next time’.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, Project-Saga may stop serializing anytime and nobody would question it, considering how it started.</p><p>Though looking at how hyped people are now, I don’t think a little rough patch will be enough to put a stop to it.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Yeah… The crowd’s got more diverse ages and backgrounds than usual. I’m kind of lost on how to act in front of them.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You just have to act like yourself. That’s how I always do it.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Because <em>you don’t know how to act any other way</em>, you mean.</p><p>…Nn~ but the audience really seems to just get bigger and bigger.</p><p>And from the looks of it, aren’t there more students watching compared to usual?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. For lives that are open to the public, students usually don’t watch from the crowd.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. The students are definitely eager to see the teacher they usually study under show his true abilities from up close. I’d watch from the front row too, if I were them.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ukh~… They don’t have to see, though. Don’t they have better things to do?</p><p>Nobody’s made a new move after DDD, so I wonder if they’re starving for topics?</p><p>Anyway, when the live is open to the public, the rule has it that the students must watch from the monitors installed in the school buildings, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It’s recommended, but not exactly a rule. …Stop hunching over, Sensei; you look pathetic.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Seriously. You’re our leader for once, so show more dignity, okay?”</p><h3 id="revival-26">Revival / 26</h3><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah, geez… You guys look so psyched about this. You can take it less seriously. As I’ve told you countless times before, Project-Saga’s a relatively irrelevant low-budget project.</p><p>Nobody will have a problem if it fails.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu.

So polite, Chiaki-san. Respecting your opponent is a good thing, but you might find the rug pulled out from under you if you don’t go at us with your lives on the line.</p><p>I was told there’s no need for holding back this time, so I’ll crush you to pieces whether you’re on your guard or not♪”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/vsJMXED.jpg"></p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “G-Go easy on me… I didn’t expect you to actually be part of this, Mikejima-san.</p><p>What changed your mind? I thought you didn’t like acting in a group?</p><p>And it doesn’t seem like you’re a temporary helper like usual, but an actual unit member…? What are you scheming?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “I’m not scheming anything – not that I’m convincing anyone by saying that. It’s just a whim; I wanted to see what this unit system was like.</p><p>So far, it’s been an annoying experience with more troubles and shackles to hold me down…</p><p>I should’ve refused. Well, since I accepted the job, I’ll see it through properly.</p><p>What about you, Chiaki-san? From the looks of it, I guess you’re enjoying yourself?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah. I’m appreciating the experience. Sure, I got more burdens to shoulder, but I don’t regret choosing to be part of Rain-bows.</p><p>Fufu. And I get to fight Mikejima-san too; we’ve never had a direct faceoff, have we?</p><p>I’ll think of this as a golden opportunity to have a practice match with Ryuuseitai’s once greatest warrior, Ryuusei Purple♪”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Ah, that was my color, huh… I’m surprised you remember; I thought it was a past you’d want to forget as much as I do.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/7Ef03OG.jpg"></p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Are you talking about colors?

You, where did you pop out from?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “&lt;HaHa~♪&gt; Sora was sticking to Mr. Giant’s back~ And being carried by him! Because Sora gets lost often, apparently!”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “M-Mr. Giant? Is that Mikejima-san?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Yeah, seems like it. Personally, I wish he’d call me Mama.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/DADhAfd.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Huff, haah… I really don’t like crowds. I ended up takin’ a long time tryin’ to cut through the sea of people. Uuukh, why do we have such a big audience?”</p><p>(Oshi-san… wouldn’t come to cheer for me, I guess. He’s a lot worse with crowds than I am.)</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Hmm. One, two, three… so Ba-barrier included, seems like we’re all gathered now.</p><p>Forget rehearsals, we’re gonna have to start the show on the spot, but are you guys okay with that?</p><p>Especially you, Kagehira. Why do you look so tired? Did Kunugi-sensei work you like a horse?</p><p>Everybody~ We got an abusive teacher here!”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Don’t say things that may be taken the wrong way. I didn’t abuse anyone. Rude.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “I-It was practically abuse, though… He summoned me everyday just t’put me through harsh lessons.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Oh! So you guys practiced every day.</p><p>Then Ba-barrier may turn out to have more finesse than us Rain-bows, who only got to gather once a week.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “&lt;HiHi~♪&gt; Except our gears wouldn’t mesh at all, so we’re actually worried if we can really pull off a show!</p><p>It made Sora realize how hard Shisho and Senpai have worked to accommodate Sora in Switch!</p><p>It’s fun here in its own right though! Then, is it the correct answer? &lt;HuHu~♪&gt;”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Ah, I’m beat… The costume-making ended up takin’ lots of time no thanks to Oshi-san startin’ to nitpick in the middle.</p><p>Ah, that’s the reason we’re late, by the way! I’m sorry, it’s all my fault!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! But thanks to that, we now have these wonderful costumes that suit us perfectly! Sorry for all the trouble, Mika-san!

It’s coming off, it’s coming off – my head’s coming off!?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “W-What a ragtag bunch… not that we can talk. We’re both teams that got made on the fly; can’t help a few rough patches here and there.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Yeah, it’s such a strange story, seriously. A pair of temporary units that came out of nowhere are holding a live together. Who would wish for this?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu. The world wished for this, I believe.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “There he goes saying unnecessarily profound things again… Kunugi-sensei, what do you know that we don’t? Why go out of your way to be part of this relatively irrelevant story?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I wonder. Think for yourself sometimes, Sagami-<em>senpai</em>…</p><p>I’m not your manager; I have no duty to tell you everything so kindly.</p><p>Fufu. I simply wanted to stand on the same stage with you like this… is that reason not acceptable?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Not unacceptable per se, but we adults aren’t so free or so full of life as to push ourselves for such reasons, right?</p><p>…That’s okay, though.

So I thought Ba-barrier would be a good chance to give him that.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “And did you tell the brats directly?

Man, this is awful, why does everybody love wargames so much? Shouldn’t singing, dancing, and cheerfully interacting with the fans be enough for idols?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I agree.

You’re saying a lot of ‘thanks’ today, Jin.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I couldn’t thank people for the love and favors they gave me when I was active… so even if it’s too late, I feel like thanking everybody a lot now.”</p><h3 id="revival-32">Revival / 32</h3><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “All of that aside, what’s this conspiracy?

We got stomped pretty easily back in the day though.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/zYX5mnC.jpg"></p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Because you weren’t even motivated. Anyway, I investigated it personally, but I couldn’t grab hold of anything solid.</p><p>The only thing for sure is, soon after this… Project-Saga will undergo a huge update.</p><p>There will be a huge inflow of cash, turning it into a big affair for the industry.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah, I heard something like that too. I see, so it wasn’t just rumors.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Oh? I thought you’d be more surprised. It appears you’re acquainted with somebody informative.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. You know how it goes: heroes never let injustice slide.</p><p>Anyway, if Project-Saga’s going big, isn’t that great? What’s the problem?</p><p>I mean, besides the trouble of me having to shave every time?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Well. First of all, there will be many mentor-disciple units created across the country, as originally planned.</p><p>When a huge investment is made, the people involved will start moving towards their goal.</p><p>While that list from before may not be realized completely, I’m sure quite a lot of retired idols will be willing to take part.</p><p>So will the many agencies and idol training schools across the country.</p><p>Project-Saga will get the whole idol industry wrapped up in it, reborn as a large-scale event.</p><p>Our board of directors would like to make Yumenosaki stand out inside all of that.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Aah, and that’s why they ordered you to protect us.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Yes. It is wretched how desperate they are to cling onto glory of the past and keep up an image, but… I don’t suppose we have the right to say that either.</p><p>Anyway, Project-Saga will cause a huge tide, which naturally means changing the future balance of powers in the idol industry.</p><p>It’ll affect many things, including SS at the end of the year.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Oh-hoh. So if our work in Project-Saga turns out to be worth crap…</p><p>Yumenosaki Academy will be publicly proven to be not up to snuff, affecting our customer traffic and evaluation in the worst ways.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Yes. If we were a joint-stock company, our stock price would be crashing to rock bottom. Not something idols belonging to Yumenosaki Academy can laugh off.</p><p>That’s why it’s necessary to make Rain-bows grow, as you are something of Yumenosaki’s representative for Project-Saga.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “So you came to pick a fight. We would clash, polish each other, and grow…</p><p>'Cause in the present, when no huge investment’s been made yet, Project-Saga’s serialization belongs to just us.</p><p>If we can produce a result – a victory – in this state, we’ll gain high evaluation and kick off to a good start.</p><p>And instead of a solo live, a live battle between units will heat up things better, and make it clearer how well or badly we’re doing.</p><p>So you became props… nah, underdogs. You know I don’t have many good memories about that kind of method.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Nevertheless, it is effective. After repeating it many times, you transformed into a peerless super idol at the end, right?</p><p>I am an old-type idol just like you, so I don’t know any other method.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “You know more than I do. Plus, I feel like you don’t intend to just go down as props…</p><p>You’re seriously coming to wreck us, huh? Especially your kids.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Yes. I deliberated about it myself. About which I should choose…</p><p>Should I act as a prop to hype you up, or kick you down to replace you?</p><p>The children in Ba-barrier are not particularly active in the public eye right now.</p><p>If they replace Rain-bows, I’m sure they can focus entirely on this project.</p><p>But in your group, there is Trickstar’s Hidaka-kun – we’ll leave <em>fine</em>’s Himemiya-kun aside for now…</p><p>And also Ryuuseitai’s Morisawa-kun, who definitely doesn’t have a lot of free time. I’m sure he wants to spend the last year of his high school life without regrets, too.</p><p>Won’t it be difficult for them to give their all for both their original units and Project-Saga?</p><p>As a matter of fact, you have been able to gather only once a week.</p><p>Still, if it is indeed possible, having you all carry on with Project-Saga is the most natural end to this.</p><p>After all, you were specifically named to take the main role.</p><p>Whether it is truly fine for us to steal that role away and replace you…</p><p>And whether it is possible, I don’t know. Of course, if the need calls, I thought to use every strategy possible to make it happen.</p><p>That’s why I decided that I would test you using this live. To see what you all are worth.</p><p>In the end, watching you practice isn’t enough; I have to fight you myself to see—</p><p>I have to <em>feel</em> what you’re capable of, against my skin. Otherwise, I won’t be satisfied. That’s what I thought, so I tried throwing down the glove, despite my age.</p><p><em>If</em> Jin’s natural-born laziness in its full glory has dragged the group down to incompetence… I will fight you, take you down, crush you and replace you.</p><p>And I will participate in Project-Saga in your place. You seem to be worn out with being an idol, anyway…</p><p>So if you are suffering, I thought to take that heavy load off your shoulders.</p><p>Well, my head swirled with such difficult thoughts, but that seemed to be all needless worry – for now. We’re still in the middle of the show, so… I should stop with the presumptions.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Right. My brats are working a lot harder than I gave them credit for. Ahaha, maybe I have what it takes to be a teacher♪”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “&lt;No comment.&gt; …well, your group is proving to be on a higher level than I expected. If you keep this up, I am sure you’ll be fine going forward.</p><p>Though in the first place, if you were to be losing to our hastily-made group, I can’t imagine you competing on even footing with other mentor-disciple groups…</p><p>Plus, the mastermind behind the plot will likely send out their treasured piece to compete in Project-Saga.</p><p>If not, they wouldn’t have invested a large sum of money in it. …Do not let your guard down, or they may eat you up.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “The mastermind who…? Is there really anybody who’d go out of their way plotting such a large-scale scheme in these times?</p><p>Honestly, what with the long winter that froze up the industry, I’d almost want to have the back of a guy with that much fight left in him.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I wonder… I have a guess, but I can’t say anything definite yet.</p><p>I approached Tenshouin-kun and a few others for my investigation too, but this mastermind will not stick out their head at all.</p><p>The enemy is not truly on the move yet. Though looking at how Project-Saga has been progressing, I believe they will show themself of their own accord eventually.</p><p>Please keep your guard up. Let’s both try our hardest so the future of the children won’t be shrouded with dark clouds.</p><p>…oops. So it appears it is our turn next; excuse me as I sing.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Mmkay. … man, you got me~ I ended up chatting around with you because you said something that caught my interest. That’s part of the strategy, huh? Making me waste my part in the show, even if it’s a short one.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu. Can you really survive and win this like that?</p><p>Perhaps you’ve forgotten because you’ve been inactive for so long – idols are all about doing everything to win, you see ♪”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nope. I just remembered, but idols are about loving and being loved.</p><p>That’s what I think.

Right?</p><p>Well, I was informed of the matter normally…</p><p>So I was laughing inside the whole time you were fuming and cursing at Sagami Jin without a single clue☆”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “…If I were to kill a person, how many years would I have to spend in jail? Maybe it’s on Wik*pedia.</p><p>But I’m a minor, so I won’t get a death sentence, that’s for sure~ Let’s see…”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Come now! Stop fiddling with your smartphone and look at me!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “…&lt;GODDAMN.&gt; Well, I understand why you guys would be hiding that from me.</p><p>If I were to know about Project-Saga, I definitely would’ve chosen that instead of SS.</p><p>I mean, Sagami Jin’s actually participating as an idol for that one, right?</p><p>I’d be able to fight on even footing with him, on a stage… If it was the me from before, I would’ve jumped on the chance watering from the mouth.</p><p>In fact, I’m <em>so</em> itching to join in and thrash that piece of garbage even <em>now</em>, y’know~?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I know. And it <em>is</em> possible to take part – didn’t he say? That’s why we are heading to school so early in the morning on our day off!</p><p>To be accompanying Jun-kun on his personal matter – I’m so selfless!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “If it’s that much trouble for you, just go home~ I’ll do this on my own.</p><p>When I saw Sagami Jin cheering for me during SS, I thought it kinda put me at rest—</p><p>But nope. My life so far has been spent thinking of only him. If I don’t put an end to it myself, I can’t see myself moving on ever~”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ehh~? You should be thinking of only <em>me</em>! Well, it’s rare for Jun-kun to be so fixated on someone… so it has piqued some of my curiosity too♪</p><p>It’s been such a long while since I last did work unrelated to Eden or Eve, so I’m looking forward to it.</p><p>I wonder what our other members are like? A new meeting means the beginning of a new happiness♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Who knows… We’re gonna go meet them now. Ibara insisted on keeping up the mystery and wouldn’t tell, so I haven’t got a clue.</p><p>The first year is the guy writing the Project-Saga articles – they call him Mr. Writer, apparently…</p><p>But he’s not a Special Student, so it’s totally possible that somebody else’ll be taking his place.</p><p>He’s mostly used as an innocent spy and a device for gathering intel, anyway.</p><p>As for the ‘mentor’… I wonder who it’s gonna be. I’d take anyone but my old man.</p><p>The one with any connection to Sagami Jin is the old man, not me, so he’ll probably happily join if we ask,</p><p>but I prefer to just let him retire for good, ya know~?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I’m not sure; I’m quite interested in meeting your father, Jun-kun♪</p><p>… but for some reason Ibara, and even <em>that</em> Nagisa-kun gave quite strange reactions when they heard of this matter.</p><p>It’s just a feeling, but I think there may be an unbelievable trump card prepared.</p><p>In fact, that will make it more interesting if it’s true! This is a story I am getting wrapped up in – it <em>has</em> to be full of unexpected turns and twists!</p><p>Aah, I can’t wait! Let’s hurry, Jun-kun! The radiant future is upon us…☆”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Okay, okay… geez, being stuck with you and your innocent ways is sapping all the venom outta me, you know~?”</p><p>(And I’m glad I get to be part of this before that venom is purified completely.</p><p>I was losing sight of it, but I’m finally going to get the chance to settle all the inner conflicts I’ve held since I was a brat.</p><p>Whoever’s gonna be my ally, whatever’s gonna happen… I am <em>definitely</em> going up on that stage to fight Sagami Jin.</p><p>And if it’s to grasp that chance, I’ll use every trick, even struggle to the last drop of blood, okay~?</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/DdFKuVt.jpg"></p><p>Wait for it, Sagami Jin! I’ll finally force you down onto all fours, along with those students you’ve put all your care into raising…!)</p></div><footer class="post-footer"><div class="post-tags"><a href="/tags/Akira/"
