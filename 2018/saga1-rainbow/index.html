Because I’m a big fan of yours, Sagami-senpai♪”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay… but work has been killing me these last few days and I’m dead tired right now. Feels like I’m gonna fall asleep anytime now.</p><p>I think I’ll just show up for the stage at the end to at least fulfill my duty…</p><p>So can you tell the Ryuuseitai guys to hang on by themselves?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Eh~? Please say such things in person instead of having other people pass on the message.</p><p>Why do you look so worn out? You’re still young, so please hang in there♪”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nah, I’m pretty much an old coot by this point… Lately kids a lot younger than me, especially girls, have started making appearances on TV.</p><p>And I mean the type of kids you’d still see with a backpack until a while ago. They’d be saying ‘Let’s both do our best♪’ with the face of a working adult…</p><p>Boy, it’s like we’re ‘playing house’.</p><p>I start thinking it’s dumb to take this job so seriously. Really.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Ahaha. It seems you are worn out body and mind, Sagami-senpai.</p><p>…If that’s the problem, I think you can take breaks from jobs you have no passion for.</p><p>Personally, I wish for Sagami-senpai to sparkle on top of a stage always.</p><p>But it definitely isn’t worth destroying your body over.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “And you’re my what, Akiyan…? You got a lot of free time, huh. Stop chasing after me and work harder for yourself.</p><p>I’d have less burdens if everyone else also put in the effort and made a name for themselves. I’m the only one being forced to slave away right now; it makes no sense.</p><p>The times have come that even brats who only know how to crawl get thrust into the limelight. The business has a serious shortage of hands.</p><p>It’s almost painful to see. Normally, don’t kids that age feel the happiest frolicking around with their school friends?</p><p>But they’re being made to work around the clock, spending grey-colored youths.</p><p>Maybe they’ve been made to believe that it <em>is</em> their youth – but me, I just feel pity.</p><p>I mean… they’re just getting exploited until they wear away like erasers, and they’ll be thrown away by the end of it.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah… Sorry 'bout that, Akiyan. I always seem to wind up whining when I see you.</p><p>You’re one of those who see dreams in idols, so I bet you don’t like to hear this kind of reality check.</p><p>Sorry, sorry. Why don’t we talk about something fun? Just a while ago, there was this really sexy lady who started stripping outta nowhere while I was singing on stage–”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Sagami-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Eh, what? Sorry, you’re prim and proper so… I guess sexy topics are out too?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “There’s a rainbow.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Rainbow? Ah… you’re right. How many years has it been since I last took a good look at a rainbow? Stars and sunsets too; they get hard to notice when you’re busy.</p><p>Do rainbows always look like that? Looks pretty blurry to me.</p><p>You think there’s really seven colors? God definitely got lazy and skipped out on a few colors there… One, two, three?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu. Speaking of, you’re Ryuusei Rainbow, aren’t you, Sagami-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn? Yeah, actually, they asked ‘What color would you like?’ when I helped out at Ryuuseitai, but…</p><p>When I said I’d be fine with whatever’s left, that somehow got me rainbow.</p><p>I’m kinda being sold as the manly and simple type, so I don’t think rainbows suit me.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Really? I think it’s the perfect color for you~ Super Idol Sagami Jin, releasing seven-colored shines…☆</p><p>…even moreso since it feels like you’ll disappear if I take my eyes off you.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ Did you say something?

I guess that’s youth for you…</p><p>But make sure to keep out of trouble, okay? Cleaning up after you is a pain.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. We’re sorry for adding to your burdens, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “It’s okay~… At the end of the day, it <em>is</em> my role as a teacher – nah, as an adult.</p><p>Anyway, sorry for calling you two all the way here. Will you do some things for me?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, that’s what we came for. Like I said before, I’m pretty free; I can do you the favor of helping with what I can, I suppose.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I think it’s not my imagination that you sound uppity, Hocchan… but I should expect as much from the son of His Majesty the King who rules over our entertainment world.</p><p>I dunno how Hidaka-san does it, still so active and hanging on even now.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Even my father doesn’t make as many appearances as he used to, though. He was grumbling about not having enough life left in him anymore.</p><p>On the other hand, Mother gains more energy the older she becomes. What a pain in the neck.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Do <em>not</em> call your parent a pain in the neck. Are you rebellious or what?</p><p>…Boy, we went off on a royal tangent there. Anyway, I’m relieved that you’re willing to help out.</p><p>To be frank with you, I’ve no idea what to do by myself.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Are you fine like that? It’s your role as a teacher to teach and guide your students, isn’t it?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, kids often get the wrong idea, but we teachers – adults in general really – aren’t omnipotent gods, okay?</p><p>Either way… we’re going nowhere like this, so I’ll get down to business.</p><p>Transfer Student. If it’s alright with you, I want you to produce me.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…</p><p>I never thought you’d stoop so low, Sagami Jin.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Eh? What’s up with that face as if you’re looking at a pest? I don’t get what ticks youngsters off…!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You disappoint me. I can’t believe you so <em>shamelessly</em> said that you want her to <em>produce</em> you…</p><p>You want her to take care of you for life, in other words? <em>Marry</em> you?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “You have some really weird misunderstandings sometimes, Hocchan… Nah, nah, I was an old-type idol so I don’t get married.</p><p>I’m simply asking her to produce me as an idol like she’s doing for the other guys.</p><p>There’s no other producer in Yumenosaki right now, so the transfer student’s the only one I can ask.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…As an – idol? You’re coming back, Sagami-sensei?</p><p>That’s great news. I was a passionate fan of yours, as a child.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No, no, it’ll be a temporary comeback… I got handed a pretty troublesome job, you see.</p><p>I don’t intend to ever become an idol again, and I don’t think anyone wants me to.</p><p>But the one asking is my benefactor, who picked me up when I was running away after retirement.</p><p>That person was the reason I get to act like a somewhat-proper working member of society like now.</p><p>I’d been in his care quite a lot during my active days too, so I want to repay the favor.</p><p>He’s this huge magnate with a lot of power over magazine companies and such, you see. When I got into a scandal, he defended me all on his own.</p><p>I see him like my other dad. He’s very old, constantly bedridden, but he came to me and lowered his head for this, claiming it to be his ‘last wish’.</p><p>No way I could refuse <em>that</em>. If you ask me, I’m more of a lowlife and a good-for-nothing, and I’ve no intention to act like a good kid so late in life, but…</p><p>If I were to crush the dying wish of such a good person underfoot, there’d really be no value in my having been born. Better strangle myself to death on the spot.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “That’s how it is, so I’m being pretty serious here, for <em>once</em>. My life’s been pretty much like dregs, but this could be its last major topic.</p><p>You guys don’t have to think about it so heavily, though.</p><p>Just like what I’ve been doing for you – you can lend me a hand with what you can do, when you feel like it.”</p><h3 id="roundabout-3">Roundabout / 3</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Project-Saga?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah, a project by that name is just starting to move, it seems. Majestic name, don’t you think?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m more bothered that the name tells me nothing about the content. What is it about? Land development project for the Saga Prefecture?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “What the heck.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Splendid, Super Idol Sagami Jin.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No idea what that praise is for… but anyway, I’ve been made the center of that program. By the recommendation of a certain bigwig, as I was saying.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. So to be more specific, what is the project about?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay, the content kind of loses out to the name, but it’s a low-budget project that’ll be carried out on a magazine, mostly.</p><p>The bigwig I was saying about, he still has power over many things even now, but he retired a long time ago. Seems like he doesn’t wanna meddle with the business too much and consequently make a mess there.</p><p>So we’ll do things discreetly, in a corner. It’s gonna be embarrassing if we stand out too much but fail, so I do prefer it this way.</p><p>The point of this project is to revive past idols who have retired.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Sagami-sensei, for example. Hmm, hence the title Project-Saga… taken from the name ‘Sagami’.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “And from the word ‘saga’… meaning heroic epic, apparently. Heroes? What heroes? It sounds so shameless and silly.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, I think you were as a matter of fact a hero of the entertainment world.</p><p>When a long winter had frozen the industry, you restored the life it lost even if temporarily, didn’t you?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ Maybe for a moment. But then again, the current youth don’t have that much energy either, so I guess they wanna toss me out there again to buck up the industry?</p><p>Your generation’s got a force to look forward to, but it still hasn’t reached the industry’s core…</p><p>So they need a stopgap until you guys are fully matured.</p><p>This plan is prolly that temporary measure.</p><p>The bigwig’s got a lot of life left in him, talking about resuscitating a legend, ‘Decree of the Restoration of Imperial Rule!’ and what-not…</p><p>But I think the guys still actively working in the field don’t expect that much from the project.</p><p>Great haul if it succeeds, but no problem if it fails. Any criticism or scandal isn’t gonna hurt or tickle me at this point either.</p><p>That’s about how much this loose plan amounts to.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… I feared for the worst since you got all serious, but it doesn’t sound like such a big project.</p><p>Though personally, if they’re going to revive you, I think they should make a far bigger deal of it.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nah, I’ve got no energy for that anymore.</p><p>If they’re gonna pour money on someone, the younger generations like you guys should be priority. Investing on <em>me</em> this late into the game isn’t gonna bear any fruit.</p><p>Well anyway, so they’re gonna temporarily revive all the once-famous idols across the country, starting with me.</p><p>I saw the list, and it’s full of famous artists everyone has heard the name of.</p><p>Well, they’re only gonna start proposing the plan to the other idols now, so I think we won’t have the exact same members as in the plan, by the end of this.</p><p>They all retired long ago and became common people, after all.</p><p>It’s absurd to kick old men’s butts and expect them to actually go on stage. I don’t wanna either, I’m just gonna disappoint my old fans.</p><p>So these ‘Legendary Idols’… says the project proposal.</p><p>These retired old coots will be grouped with two to three young kids.</p><p>So that in the worst case if we Legendary Idols end up being a waste of resources, the young artists can work hard to put up an appearance, at least…</p><p>Or that’s what I believe the project leader is thinking.</p><p>So, the deal is, we Legendary Idols get positioned as mentors, while the young artists with future potential… become disciples for us to raise.</p><p>They wanna write a master-disciple story like often seen in <em>shounen manga</em>, I take it.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. I don’t read <em>manga</em>, so I have no idea. So they have that kind of cliche.</p><p>Then you’re perfect for it, Sagami-sensei. You <em>are</em> presently a teacher, even if a lousy one.</p><p>You’re already in the position of a ‘mentor’.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah, I bet they got the idea from my occupation~ This plan’s almost sickeningly tailored to center on me.</p><p>Talk about annoying. The commissioner probably had the wrong idea about me…</p><p>When I told him I’m a teacher, he shed manly tears and went all ‘You’ve grown up so much, Jin-kun!’ on me, y’know.”</p><h3 id="roundabout-4">Roundabout / 4</h3><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, that’s how it is, so as a ‘Legendary Idol’, I’ll need to take a few disciples under my wing.</p><p>I was thinking to call out to whoever looks like they have a lot of free time.</p><p>But would you like to do it, Hocchan?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… I can’t make a decision right away, but I <em>am</em> interested. It depends on the working hours, the reward, and what experiences I’ll gain, though.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah, expect to be paid chicken feed. I said this is a low-budget plan, didn’t I?</p><p>But if we can convince the student council, the academy may be willing to pay more on the side.</p><p>If possible, I want to leave the job of such negotiations to you, Transfer Student. And I want your cooperation for a bunch of other things, actually… as a producer.</p><p>I have my day job as a teacher, so I can’t pour that much time into Project-Saga.</p><p>To be honest, it’s such a pain in the butt. I’d dump the whole deal on the transfer student if I could.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Why do you have so little motivation, Sagami-sensei…? And the transfer student’s still not used to the academy, so stop giving her more burdens.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, you don’t have to work too hard for it. I just need your help with what you can do, and when you feel like it.</p><p>It’s a low-budget plan with no stress, so it’s not gonna hurt your work history if it fails.</p><p>In fact, I think it’ll be good practice for any actual producer work you’ll be doing in the future.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You can reject him, Transfer student. From what I’ve heard, it’ll bear too little fruit to justify the time and effort you’ll have to put in.</p><p>Time is finite, so it’s wiser to spend it focusing on matters of more importance.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yup. He’s not wrong about that. Until you came, we teachers were in charge of the producer-like jobs, and we still are, actually.</p><p>I <em>can</em> deal with it on my own, for the most part.</p><p>Take it home with you and think it through at your own pace. I got the proposal copied, so I’ll hand one each to you two.</p><p>If you’ve decided to help, or not help, you can quietly come up to me after homeroom or something.</p><p>Also, if you can introduce me to anyone who looks like they’d be interested in Project-Saga, that’ll help me a bunch.</p><p>I need around two or three kids to become my disciples, after all.</p><p>By the way, the commissioner wants to spread the age of the disciples apart, I heard.</p><p>It isn’t a must, but ideally, we’d like one person from the first year, second year, and third year each.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. That’s a weird request to make. What’s the meaning in spreading the ages?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No idea… The Legendary Idols are varied in age too, so the young guys being all of the same generation will make it seem unbalanced, I think?</p><p>The commissioner said having representatives from various generations will portray the history of idols more comprehensively or something… a knotty reasoning of that line.</p><p>Well, it sounded like tall tales so I just let it in one ear and out the other.</p><p>But I’m thinking since you’re all the same age in Trickstar, it’ll be good to let you interact more with the other grades.</p><p>Even just one year’s gap can result in huge differences, and I bet it’ll be good stimulation.</p><p>Of course, I dunno yet if you will or won’t take the offer.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… Well, I’ll consider.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay, think it through for me~ You guys can go home now. Sorry to keep you.</p><p>If you don’t understand anything about the proposal while reading, you can ring me and ask. I’ll give you my number too, Transfer Student.</p><p>You know, it doesn’t have to have anything to do with Project-Saga – you can gimme a call if you need something, anything. I <em>am</em> your homeroom teacher.</p><p>If a boy sexually harasses you, call me ASAP. You’re surrounded by dudes in the heat of their youth and all~ I’m so worried for your purity.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Except <em>your</em> words already constitute as sexual harassment, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dLI16JtOa_T65NZeegpw-T5bmHbVP94V0qj9BpjORywus-478DMDYY6qeg8zxbJTloPC8Gw9geexXB77Mij5grBAgtmnQNl9DkciGq5Cy84vpvMwlUgqOP42ZShl9TMBK7IiCixjiUv2qqx_svxXt1NJUotEL6FaaHz3RpntO9BARs0tcQcT2O3bbB9ngbqM0IsOwAJp86mdyQBaUSs32obGNkMq6obWprK5lCfmXBt5gHWC4lisPVIIoXHbyUqKiV2_AxTxICN-k1erKAs4koNIdn94U8dVcueEyRdf2tB7f15HiciYuvDGCkxAyx_UEELltEcFqDeubWsbHWg-f6IDb9eSNRhNnK6js0xChukZGbhqMn5pko8tXfojoJMEUsDX6tQNKdvW3e6z3HAVZ3SD4UUVLLvpSnAj8RT4iZmkBsc9TQdO8GnvTIBoyo8ahsOVWaiDo7ScJnbY7QERWtTrSBX_3rZDAeUWCluG85loSX5BIXRpxWbNNkOAVGDMhkHFhcGM6WNvGVrlVxm63F2LcBXOsnFDTAOvNnSXc1Ye2EB7BTDBhDeqdkCmt4lb7JS5h6h8Tqv1gCeXIh_hu07B5k3xFq4YYkJUQHvVEfXIhccsuL-BFQmAFBf7tdw6G6fj7W1PUvZ_d5O1Nh54Hy1UBtyAMFiFS3tgnu2oZ9LT=w1136-h640-no"></p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “…Oh?

About reviving past idols, or something?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You know about it, Yuuki? You’re well-informed as ever.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No, it’s a coincidence. I still get sent complimentary copies of magazines because I used to work as a child model.</p><p>Just a look at them used to send a chill up my spine, but I’ve grown to be able to flip through them lately…</p><p>I skim through them sometimes, like when my game is loading.</p><p>This Project-Saga seems to be a plain, low-budget project, but the staff roster has some pretty influential people of the magazine industry.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah, it seems so. Sagami-sensei talked about one being his benefactor.</p><p>That lazybones is trying to put a serious effort into something for once…</p><p>I have regrettably been in his care, so I’d like to help out with what I can.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh right, Hokke.

Then I need to find a first year and a third year next.</p><p>Unfortunately, I’m not too familiar with students from the other year levels… I’ve neither an idea nor a mark on where to look.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Oh… So they’re recruiting a kind of ‘representative player’ from each grade, huh?</p><p>How about the Light Music Club? They helped with our revolution; they may be the easiest to ask.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No… that’s exactly why I hesitate to lean on them further.</p><p>I’ll have no choice but to ask them if I can’t find other alternatives, but still, there’s no novelty in always working with the same people.</p><p>That’s what I think, so those two from the Theater Club, who are some of my few associates, also wouldn’t be ideal. But after all this nitpicking, I’m left with no one else to ask.</p><p>Early morning, I happened across Sena-senpai in the classroom, so I asked him.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eh!? Why would Izumi-san be in a second-year classroom? I don’t know but that’s so scary!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… It seems Knights have been doing volunteer work to restore their name after their misconduct in DDD.</p><p>He was cleaning up the schoolhouse and stuff.</p><p>He was also playing pretend, sitting down on the seat next to yours and saying ‘Ufufu~ I’m in the same class as Yuu-kun♪’”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “What the – that’s so gross…!? And unbelievably scary! I don’t get it at all!</p><p>Wai – he didn’t touch my desk, did he? I have to check and see if he set up a tapping device…!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. You don’t have to be so wary. Speaking to him, I find that he’s surprisingly a decent person with down-to-earth views. Even if his conduct is criminal.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “<em>That’s</em> the problem!</p><p>Eek!? He casually wrote down his contact in my student handbook that I left behind~!</p><p>Y-You’re going to invite that person to join that… Project-Saga event? I’d really advise against that? He caused trouble and got into a dispute with a magazine company once!</p><p>This is a project mainly developed in a magazine, right? You’ll risk triggering needless conflict with him around, you know~?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. He said that too. But he added a favorable response at the end, saying that if I <em>really</em> insist, he’d be willing to reconsider in exchange of a personal belonging of yours, Yuuki.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yup! That’s why I tried to steal your personal belonging – your glasses – before this!</p><p>That’s the entire story! Bet you’re glad to have the full picture now, Ukki~♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No!? I’m in incredible dismay!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. But the reality is that Sena-senpai… or the entire Knights are still in a steep situation.</p><p>I think he meant that as a subtle rejection, so there’s probably little hope he’d help me out with Project-Saga.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No, I mean it – I <em>really</em> advise against taking him, okay~?</p><p>If Izumi-san joins Project-Saga, it’s possible that he’ll hang around Hidaka-kun a lot under the pretext of discussing the project, right?</p><p>I’m going to skip school?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That would be trouble. Hmm… but I really have no idea on who to ask. Must I really seek the Light Music Club’s – Sakuma-senpai and the twins’ – help?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hey hey. That Project-Saga thingy’s going to center on Sagami-chan, right?</p><p>Then how about asking Chii-chan-senpai? He’s said many times that he’s a big fan of Sagami-chan, even when no one was asking.</p><p>If he joins Project-Saga then on top of it helping Sagami-chan, he’ll get the chance to study under him as a disciple, right?</p><p>I think he’ll be very thrilled to accept, maybe♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm? Chii-chan… senpai? Who?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ryuuseitai’s Red-and-Annoying Morisawa Chiaki-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Aah, that person. We’ve never really spoken; so he’s Sagami-sensei’s fan, huh.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yup. Sagami-chan appeared in a tokusatsu movie in the past or something…</p><p>Chii-chan-senpai loves that stuff, so he’s been a passionate fan since the movie aired, or so he says.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. I see; he sounds like the perfect person for this. If I recall correctly, he’s the leader of Ryuuseitai, so he’s definitely pretty busy,</p><p>but I want to try asking anyway. Can you give me Morisawa-senpai’s contact info, Akehoshi?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh! I don’t think I have his number or anything like that… But he’d come flying if you shout for help in a really loud voice, probably?</p><p>Like, <em>‘I’m in trouble!

It’s been a while! I’m glad to see you so well!</p><p>Come over, come over, come over! Let Mama give you a hug☆”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I don’t mind a hug to celebrate the reunion but… seriously, can I know what you’re doing?</p><p>I was alarmed to see a crowd gathering in front of the school gate. You never stop causing commotions, do you?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! You should be able to tell just by looking – don’t ask for every little thing! Think, imagine! I’m imitating Leo-san!</p><p>Hahaha, when you spend your entire time with someone for a while, you start picking up their habits, huh♪”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “What do you mean? Leo… Tsukinaga, huh? I haven’t seen him in a while. Is he doing fine? I’m worried.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hmm, I’d like to think he’s doing fine. He’s a strong boy.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Not everyone is as strong as you, Mikejima-san. Don’t use yourself as the standard; even the strongest guys can shatter, too.</p><p>Anyway, from what I see, you’re going around selling breads on a stall… a pushcart.</p><p>Did you properly get permission for this? The teachers will get angry with you.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! How can one serve justice if they are too scared of authorities!”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “You think I’ll agree if you just slide in the word ‘justice’, don’t you?</p><p>You don’t want to attract unwanted attention, right? Have some restraint, Mikejima-san.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. I’m helping someone out, though. There’s a bakery in the neighborhood worried about the recent slump in sales, you see. So I’m selling their commodity in their place.</p><p>The school store has gotten fancier in their product line-up, and that’s put the other stores in the neighborhood at a disadvantage.</p><p>When one goes up, the other goes down. That’s the law of nature.</p><p>When one person laughs, another cries. And I can’t stand the guys currently laughing. That’s why I’m siding with those who are crying. Got any problem with that?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…No. Not if that’s your justice, Mikejima-san.</p><p>Rather than that – Mikejima-san, will you be flying to another country soon? I have something to ask if you’re planning to stick around for a while.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Aah, is that what you really came for? [Two birds with one stone]! This way, you can warn me <em>and</em> ask something from me at the same time! Nice judgment!</p><p>Okay, let’s hear out this request of yours, Chiaki-san!</p><p>You’re a good person. Acting as you want me to will allow even someone like me to seem like an ally of justice.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “You’re already a ‘hero of justice’ on your own, Mikejima-san. You were the only one worthy enough to introduce yourself as such in the old Ryuuseitai.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “You think too highly of me… Ah well, I’m planning to stay in the country for some time.</p><p>What do you want me to do? I’ll answer within my power.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right, well, I think it’s weird to ask this from you when you’ve resigned from Ryuuseitai, but…</p><p>Will you look after the Ryuuseitai kids every now and then?</p><p>I want you to give them guidance when I’m not around.</p><p>Kanata and I are the only seniors in Ryuuseitai right now, and Kanata doesn’t seem used to dealing with the kids yet.</p><p>So I want to leave them in the hands of someone I can trust. I can’t look after them all the time; there’ll definitely be times I have to take sick breaks and such.</p><p>Even today, an underclassman asked to meet up with me.</p><p>I’ll have to set aside time for him after school. So I need someone else to substitute for me, when things like this happen.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hmm? Should you really trust me? But if you ask whether I can or can’t, it’ll be the former.</p><p>I <em>can</em> give guidance to the kids, and I don’t dislike caring for people. If you really insist, I’ll take responsibility for the kids and protect them during your absence, Chiaki-san.</p><p>But I can’t praise your thinking. I’m somewhat at odds with Ryuuseitai, and both the student council and the teaching staff keep a watchful eye on me.</p><p>If I get involved, it’s likely that I’ll end up being trouble for Ryuuseitai.</p><p>Instead of asking me, you should wake Kanata-san to his duty as an upperclassman and get him to work…</p><p>Or ask others completely unrelated to Ryuuseitai.</p><p>Even if it isn’t a third year, you can ask the teachers or the producer of fame.</p><p>There’s a meaning in my acting as a solo unit, so I actually prefer to not mingle with groups too much.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm… A ‘lone hero’ may have a cool ring to it, but don’t you get lonely?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “I do. People don’t believe me when I say this, but I love humans.</p><p>Well, maybe that’s fair. I couldn’t protect those precious to me at the important time, and let them die – so I don’t have the right to love.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…I don’t think Kanata blames you, Mikejima-san.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “No. Even if that’s true, this is my way of taking ‘responsibility’.</p><p>Oops, I’ve left my customers waiting.</p><p>I’ll think your request through, so you should go back to class before lunch break ends… honor student.</p><p>Walk down the right path, Hero.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yes… You should show up for class too, Mikejima-san. Everyone’s worried about you.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. I think you’re the only one worried, Chiaki-san – but that’s already plenty.”</p><h3 id="roundabout-9">Roundabout / 9</h3><p><strong>&gt; Garden Terrace</strong></p><p>&lt; Ten minutes later &gt;</p><p><img alt data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DO_7l0XdvkwpL7VTFjzsuZ8vFkZ5Hawh8cbr4PO0aTea38Z3KxQ5QoOX73X9GnMn2bGe-8rN8hV8Z_quTP2svIOhDq1RWqRxDHCRJX8wBGIxrrn0LAT3jVkzIRePqzzIemFGq_9a6V_QXlg2Fp5NlYKkE7v-Ydp_lsWrWWmyde0KP5_qYT6VxLjXaxmCd4CmtQpoAr7e1JgweSpjtsgH1Lz4vLMDOM1afUrla1jlvCqbz5X4eguY299rlCJ8d23K6yAkjP9NVmBQFfCSnMDU5vBWSMA7FN68cKstMGIGAy0XNil-Ut2mPpkTLbKo9QltvdOLz_p1XnWZ3EyjOF5LA0wZ8ZVAX8LzjO54no4iE6oUfKjTdNDmg41vLcyDs6LmD5PMbA8admS0i7R7t-BoBaHKwgcYTt8FAOKKA4MpJaeZIV3PrRIX6JHHHOBp9edQSE_uw7e7k92LJ7Wp243Qoc1p7uGJHCb9jZ93DNcSzLjcgNDzTlJJlK9CIsb4Yx9doe3MuC4qAwVtHOecpSrHuyRccgS_AZ0B8QCPnc5HepwYFopWhocfWM_3l1QBfPVHVRvESskxv38kn6mZp5D7bdXAEGJQWmedKjKk4bYzC03DG6QcAtMy7cKP4f3DjG4ddBIuD-JfZKKWsk-vF0auLPvZK5Z28x7CrToHGATNAuOu=w1136-h640-no"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ooi, Transfer student.

Alcohol isn’t good for health, and I’m personally happy that you’re making a comeback as an idol.</p><p>…Even if I can’t wipe away the question of ‘<em>why now</em>?’ since so much time has passed.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I explained it to you already. There’s a low-budget plan named Project-Saga which is about reviving past idols.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Yes, and I’m happy about that. Male idols generally have a long career in the industry, like Hidaka-daisenpai…</p><p>So I’ve always thought that you retired too early.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Same with you. Anyway, you talk about a long career, but it’s more that the old men are being made to work because there’s no one else to replace them.</p><p>It’s not good to be stealing the limelight from the youngsters. The world is moving forward.</p><p>So the entertainment industry gotta renew their lineup too. …not that I care about where it’s heading after all this time.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Why are you a teacher at an idol training school, then?</p><p>You had other options – choose a different job, build a family, and become one with the common people.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I hate that term, the <em>common</em> people~ Then what are idols? Gods? Objects of faith to be looked up at and worshiped from the distance?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Hmm… something lower, I believe. Like slaves.</p><p>During our times, we didn’t have the freedom to work or marry – no, there was a pressure disapproving of such choices.</p><p>Ah… this isn’t good at all. I’m growing to whine more with age.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahaha. It’s okay, it’s okay. Kunugi-sensei’s still young by society’s standards.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “So are you. …You just diverted the topic, didn’t you, Sagami-sensei?</p><p>If you no longer have an attachment to showbiz and idols, then why do you remain in this kind of place?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nah, other lines of occupation just wouldn’t take me, is all.</p><p>I gave my entire youth to being an idol; that’s all I devoted myself to, and I learned nothing else.</p><p>I’m valuable as crap. All I had to do when young was to give my all for what’s in front of me, but I regret that a little now.</p><p>I wish I’d played around more, studied other things.</p><p>I learned at my family’s hospital once, but the experience isn’t enough to allow me to become a proper doctor this late…</p><p>I have my connections and people’s pity to thank for allowing me to become the school doctor I am.</p><p>Well, I have the savings built up from my idol work, so I could’ve played around till I’m dead without lifting a finger for work, really.</p><p>But I’m gonna run to waste if I don’t meet with people at all~</p><p>I actually secluded myself for a bit after retirement; it felt like I aged overnight.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu. Despite looking annoyed when people bother you, you start longing for company if we leave you alone… A troublesome person you are, goodness.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “What are people if not troublesome? Even if human resources that carry out their role endlessly like robots may be preferable as workforce.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “The times have changed, you know. The world is moving in a new direction.</p><p>This is about another school, but there’s a student who manages various companies despite their young age, and many more.</p><p>The future of the children is broader and freer than we may think.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Huh, a high school CEO – sounds like a little kid playing house. Too much has changed, this old man can’t keep up with the times anymore.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Now, now… don’t say that. Let’s try hard for a little longer. I have your back, Jin.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “…Thanks a bunch, Akiyan.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Don’t mention it. And stop idling around; let’s make better use of the time we have. I’ll restart the lesson, Sagami-sensei.</p><p>You need to at least restore some of the ability you had at your peak.</p><p>You’ve always acted like you’re better than the kids, as their teacher. Surely you’d like to save face?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Right, that’s why I asked you to hold a lesson for me. You gotta join me every now and then, after this too. I’ll do something to thank you later.</p><p>Practicing solo is nice and all, but I’ll <em>definitely</em> end up skipping if I’m on my own.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “You’re a lazybones, after all. I wonder where you found the resolve to partake in this project – even if it was a plea from your benefactor.”</p><h3 id="roundabout-12">Roundabout / 12</h3><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Umm, the originator of this project is <em>that</em> magazine company magnate, right?</p><p>I thought he’d decided to retire completely to spend his old days in peace, but there seems to be a lot of life left in his aged body.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. Talked with him a few times, and he sounded pretty full of vigor still.</p><p>And here I was worried because he asked me to ‘grant his last wish’ and stuff.</p><p>…You were prolific as a model, so you know the magazine industry better than I do, don’t you?</p><p>Are we actually playing a dangerous game here? It’s smelling fishy at some places, y’see.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I wonder. I’m a traitor who turned against the magazine industry and the modeling world…</p><p>Even if there is some hidden intent, no one there likes me enough to tell me.</p><p>In fact, since I caused quite a mess there, I fear for the children. What if they’re bearing the brunt of my actions?</p><p>People seeing them and thinking, '<em>Aah, it’s a Yumenosaki kid. Must be Kunugi’s student, then.’</em></p><p>'<em>Then, they’re probably going to turn on us like Kunugi did’</em>—and such.</p><p>That’s why I think I shouldn’t get too close with the children currently active in modeling.</p><p>…or am I being too self-conscious?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nah. It’s true that people drag out grudges and hard feelings longer than you expect.</p><p>There are guys who’ve never quit bugging me even after I retired.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Ah, you mean that person who sent you a ‘cursed video’ in this day and age? In the end, what was that?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Who knows… it creeps me out so I don’t think too deeply about it. I asked Hasumi to burn the so-called cursed video for me.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Hmm. What was the name of the underdog who appeared in that video?</p><p>Have you contacted him? He <em>is</em> still alive… isn’t he?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Underdog, he says… Nah, why’d you expect me to contact him?</p><p>If he had nothing to do with it, then I’d be a nuisance just by bringing up the topic. And if he turns out to be the culprit, I don’t even wanna converse with him.</p><p>…but y’know, his name is in the list of retired idols planned to be invited to join Project-Saga.</p><p>The rotten business exploited him and he was stuck as the ‘eternal second place’ since I debuted…</p><p>But he was still a pretty famous idol, with a history of success behind him.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Oh. Then it may become a long-awaited reunion for the both of you.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “God, spare me… I don’t have the face to meet him after all this time. I mean, how could I? It’s not like we have pretty memories to recollect either.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “But he was a rival of Sagami Jin the Super Idol.</p><p>People may be fired up to see your long-awaited reunion and rematch.</p><p>I was a fan as well, so I’d <em>love</em> to see it – it’ll be a nice trip down memory lane.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, it’s basically a project for middle-aged people and above to take a nostalgia trip. Rubbish…</p><p>I’m sure the old coots would be thrilled to see that ‘old rivals’ face-off’ if it actually happens,</p><p>But plans are no more than plans. We dunno yet how many retirees are willing to come back for this low-budget project.</p><p>I mean, a look at the list made me laugh, y’know? Felt like some little kid’s ‘<em>original list, don’t steal!</em>’ deal.</p><p>Made me feel that probably, the list wasn’t made by that magnate, but the hard work of a young kid who got ordered to put it together by their boss.</p><p>There was Hidaka-san’s name when he isn’t even retired, and ‘that Akehoshi’ who can’t possibly return to idol work anymore.</p><p>Whichever kid wrote it probably just copied down what he saw in some idol encyclopedia.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Eh – <em>that man</em> is alive!?</p><p>To have Jin on stage with Hidaka-daisenpai and Akehoshi-senpai would make for a true all-star cast of dreams.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No, he’s deceased. The showbiz killed – nah, <em>all</em> of us let him die.</p><p>We loved an idol together and strangled him to death together.</p><p>…We can’t romanticize that, nor pretend it ‘never happened’.</p><p>With the fact that a sinless man died there, any love, dream, and hope that showbiz promotes just sounds like hypocrisy.</p><p>It’s all like a bad joke. A bunch of horseshit.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “But shunning what our predecessors worked hard to build, simply due to a single tragedy…</p><p>…would be what true insincerity – futility – is like, wouldn’t it?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Idols have always been a gamble, an exercise in futility. The white-collar workers working to the bone out there are the better guys, they contribute more to society.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Why is your outlook so bleak…? Well, I guess you can’t help that. But will you be fine like that, ‘Sagami-senpai’?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Who cares. I just gotta save face until the project ends. My duty ends, I step down again.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Ahaha. Well, thank you for the hard work, then. …You have absolutely no intention to make a real comeback, I take it?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I didn’t retire for nothing; I doubt anyone still wishes to see me there. This is such a weird project. I just hope there’s really no hidden agenda…”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Hmm, if you’re really bothered, should I pull a few strings to see what I can dig up?</p><p>My relation with magazine companies is hopeless, but I do have a bigger network with industry people than you do…</p><p>A new fact may come to light if I probe a little.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~… I don’t think it’s anything that big, but it’d help if you could look into it whenever you’re free.</p><p>We gotta avoid causing trouble for the brats, after all.</p><p>A~ah… Why did things turn out like this? I’m getting lazy.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Don’t say that. For the first time in a long while, this is a story with you in the main role. Make the most out of it, because I’ll be watching over you and having a good time, myself.”</p><h3 id="roundabout-13">Roundabout / 13</h3><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Excuse us~♪</p><p>Look, this’s gotta be the last room.

I hesitate to get Akehoshi involved in that.</p><p>As you know, Akehoshi’s a big ball of perkiness and innocence, a guy like a main character who probably won’t lose out to anyone…</p><p>But he’s also carrying something hazardous inside; a bomb that may burst with just a single touch.</p><p>And the way he is now, I don’t know if he’s strong enough to hang on when it explodes. His surroundings will take damage too, and I’m sure Akehoshi doesn’t want that.</p><p>We won DDD and brought a revolution upon Yumenosaki Academy… You can say it’s been smooth sailing, yet it’s still a very thin ice we’re walking on.</p><p>It’s better to keep that in mind and be very cautious with the action we take. …or am I being a coward?</p><p>Fufu. Anyway, Project-Saga is, to the end, a detour for us. I prefer to get things done fast, instead of dragging it out.</p><p>First, we need to get our current hurdle over with, which is gathering comrades.</p><p>Yes. That’s why I called Morisawa-senpai over, as he is the likeliest to become our third-year participant.</p><p>We arranged a meeting here, so I plan to have a face-to-face with him now.</p><p>…though it appears Senpai is slightly tardy.</p><p>I wonder if something happened? He doesn’t seem like the sort of person to break promises or rules without reason.</p><p>I barely ever spoke with him so I only have a vague idea, but he’s probably a serious honor student-type, right?</p><p>I think he didn’t cause any trouble last year…</p><p>No, he didn’t seem very involved in the disputes either, so I don’t have much to go on.</p><p>Hmm, Akehoshi often speaks badly of Morisawa-senpai. But Akehoshi and I don’t hit off well, so perhaps I’ll turn out to get along with him.”</p><h3 id="roundabout-15">Roundabout / 15</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Nn? What’s wrong, Transfer Student? You’re laughing. Did I say anything funny?</p><p>Hm? Gathering comrades like this is new, and pretty fun…?</p><p>Fufu, I’m sure it is. By the time you transferred, most students had already formed their own units.</p><p>This’ll be your first time picking out the idols that suit the job to form a team.</p><p>But it’s one of the things a producer does, right?</p><p>Yeah. You should get used to it. I was thinking to get by on my own where possible, since I don’t want to give you further burden,</p><p>But I really should’ve sought help from you, a trustworthy producer, from the start.</p><p>As you see, my efforts haven’t borne any fruit, so I want to borrow your help.</p><p>Nn? That was your intent since the beginning? Because you’re also part of the project?</p><p>That’s true… So I was being too distant; I’ll reflect on it. Keeping someone out of the loop isn’t the same as being considerate.</p><p>Yeah. It’s not too late yet to look for comrades together… I hope you’ll lend your assistance.</p><p>This is a good chance for you to practice how to scout and such.

I’m so so sorry for arriving late!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah, please raise your head. It’s okay; we had each other’s company and chatted around as we waited.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. I see, that’s good. …You two seem very close, holding hands and all!</p><p>I don’t think that’s too good, seeing as she’s of the opposite sex.

No, I’m sure it means your bonds as comrades are so tight and run so deep that you pay no regard to gender! I’ll go with the positive interpretation!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s a help. Anyway, I apologize for calling you out here. You must be busy, Morisawa-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yes! Pretty busy, actually!</p><p>Ryuuseitai is centered on the inexperienced first years, and sadly, we lost at the first round during DDD!</p><p>We’re not gonna get spoon-fed with jobs if we just sit around in the state we’re in – so I’ve been running around looking for work to do!</p><p>And I’ve got to coach my juniors from scratch, since they still don’t know the ropes with idol stuff.</p><p>Before I got here, I instructed them to continue with the lesson while I was gone…</p><p>But I ended up rambling on out of worry, reasoning with the kids who didn’t seem at all motivated… and here I am, not arriving on time.</p><p>That’s not a good excuse to be late, though. I’m the one doing a bad job of holding myself together as an upperclassman.</p><p>But I can’t get ahold of Kanata, Mikejima-san doesn’t seem to want to get involved… so I’ll just have to make do.</p><p>Well, it <em>does</em> make my life fulfilling and fun! Fuhahahaha♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (Hmm… Akehoshi belittled him all the time so I had some concerns, but Morisawa-senpai really does seem like an upstanding man.</p><p>A pleasant, dependable upperclassman – his type is actually a rarity in this school.)</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Nn? What’s wrong, looking at me like that? If you fall for me, you’ll get burned ☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No… Rather than that, since you seem busy, I’d like to get to the main topic.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah. Of course. I always speak too much, sorry.</p><p>But anyway, I know the situation. Project-Saga, right? It sounds like such an interesting project.</p><p>Sagami-sensei, my inspiration, is making a comeback! What a fiery happening we have here – just like what I’ve seen in my dreams♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Mmn? Are you familiar with the content of Project-Saga, Morisawa-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah, I got myself hurt so I went to the infirmary to get treated… Sagami-sensei brought it up then, as part of our little chat.</p><p>It doesn’t seem like the project is planned to be carried out in secret, so he explained it to me in detail.</p><p>Sagami-sensei seemed quite into it, surprisingly. Talked about doing his best with vocal training.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Is that so…? So that slothful teacher is actually serious this time.</p><p>That’s why, as to not waste Sagami-sensei’s efforts, we need to form a team as specified in the project proposal.</p><p>Morisawa-senpai. You’ll be of tremendous help if you lend us a hand.</p><p>Please, will you join us as a comrade?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right!

I thought <em>you</em> would definitely help us out.</p><p>To be honest, I feel dejected. My head even went blank for a second there… Can you tell me the reason?”</p><h3 id="roundabout-16">Roundabout / 16</h3><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right. Personally, I wish I could help whenever my aid is sought, but this is really a bad time.</p><p>As hard as it is for me to say this, I don’t think I can help you guys out.</p><p>I said before that this is an important time for Ryuuseitai.</p><p>We have inexperienced first years, and the only ones around to guide them are a hack like me and Kanata who’s constantly absent.</p><p>Because I made a move based on personal feelings, our appearance in DDD ended fruitlessly…</p><p>So I want to prioritize my juniors’ feelings and situations from now on.</p><p>They have talent. I felt a spark when I met them for the first time.</p><p>But their shine may not get noticed if I don’t give my all to accentuate them in plain sight.</p><p>So I’ll lift them up high with all of my power. If their shine pales and dims like midday stars, I’ll make them into comets that glitter in the night sky.</p><p>That’s how I take ‘responsibility’. For talking big, showing them the illusion of a dream, and making them my comrades.</p><p>For forcefully giving them pushes on the back, and telling them to ‘<em>do their best</em>’, that ‘<em>they could do it if they try</em>’…</p><p>If I let go of them for just a second here, they may end up falling, because they’re still not ready.</p><p>They’ll bathe in mud, and with a look of hurt lift their face and tell me – ‘<em>You’re a liar</em>’.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Once, I longed to be like the heroes on TV, so I did all I could to imitate their way of life.</p><p>Each time, reality pushed my head to the ground and tripped my feet. I cursed the people I admired.</p><p>For being liars… Dreams will come true if you believe? Love will save the world? A hero will come running if you cry for help?</p><p>They were lies, all of it. But that’s why I don’t want those kids to have to experience the feelings I did.</p><p>If there are no heroes in this world, I will become its first hero.</p><p>I will make the dream I believed in come true, save the world with love, and run to the people who cry and embrace them!</p><p>If I become such a hero, the heroes on TV won’t be liars anymore!</p><p>That would mean the heroes I admired and loved truly exist!</p><p>I can believe that they were right all along! That they never told a single lie!</p><p>That’s my dream. What I want to be isn’t a liar or a crook – it’s a hero.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “That’s why. I can’t help you guys out, and I can’t join Project-Saga. I don’t have enough life for that; I constantly have my hands full right now.</p><p>I’m really sorry for being weak… I wish I was an invincible hero, or maybe a genius capable of everything.</p><p>But in reality, it takes everything of me just to hold my ground.</p><p>All I can do is consider each step carefully so I won’t fail, moving forward in constant wariness. I don’t have the time – no, the capacity – to be taking a roundabout route.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…I see.</p><p>I understand. I’m satisfied now.

A hero never turns their back on a child with such a gloomy look!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Well… I’m happy you feel that way, but are you <em>really</em> sure?</p><p>I’d feel sorry to cause trouble for Ryuuseitai – for another unit.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Too late to say that, you know? You guys don’t live on your own; you give birth to frictions just by going about like always.

What we can do is never cease thinking, keep giving our best efforts!</p><p>That’s what I want to do! So please, make me your comrade! That way, at least I may be able to make <em>you</em> smile!</p><p>With this method, I’ll spread smiles one by one!</p><p>If it is the way of the world that when someone smiles, another has to cry, then I’ll take on all the tears in the world!</p><p>Don’t worry!

I’ll take care to remember that!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “If only you’d actually put those words into practice.</p><p>…why are you wearing your unit outfit anyway? Did you have a job as Ryuuseitai from the morning?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yes! I was standing on the side of the school road to do morning greetings!</p><p>Also, I wear this outfit for no reason sometimes because I’m just so happy to be Red!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Huh. But you have only one of that outfit, I think? Don’t get it dirty.</p><p>Ah well. …Whaddya need today? Did the wound I treated the other day fester or something?</p><p>Let me take a look. Sit there.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yes! Ryuusei Red, sitting!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Uh, can you spare this old man from your game? Speak normally. You’re in high school already, stop playing hero.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hehe♪ There’s no problem, Sagami-sensei! Because I’m not ‘playing’!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No, that adds more to the problem… Nn.

Skipping?</p><p>The bell’s gonna ring soon, so go straight to class instead of taking detours.</p><p>I gotta close up the infirmary and head to 2-A too if I don’t want my students getting on my case for neglecting my homeroom duties and stuff.</p><p>…anyway, it’s probably too late to complain, but why am I being put in charge of a class when I’m the school doctor? Does Yumenosaki just have so few staff?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. I’m sure it’s because they think you can be counted on, Sagami-sensei. That’s why they keep giving work to you. No rest for heroes! ♪”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nah, I’m no ally of justice so I wanna have my rest.</p><p>…I could’ve refused if I really wasn’t up to it though; I guess I still can’t leave the habit of making rash promises.</p><p>But refusing people is also such a mental drain.</p><p>Sometimes, it’s just easier to accept and make ends meet somehow by exerting yourself.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fuhaha♪ As I would expect from you, Sagami-sensei! So kind! Unable to reject people who seek help – you truly have the qualities of a hero!</p><p>That’s why you are the Legendary Hero… Ryuusei Rainbow☆”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “You’re about the only one who still remembers that name. And honestly, if you want it so much, I’m more than happy to have that silly title off my hands.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “No, no! I like being Red!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “That so.

Since I get injured a lot!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “You bet you do… Are you okay? You’re not being bullied, are you?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “No, it’s because I’ve been taking more stunt work these days. It’s my way of laying the groundwork, since I want to network with industry people.</p><p>And I thought I might be able to get more jobs for Ryuuseitai if I got along better with people in the field.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Hmm. Stunts, huh. As an idol, you’re the one who should be substituted by a stuntman, y’know?</p><p>You might’ve got off with light injuries so far, but no one knows what can happen. Be extra careful, you hear me?</p><p>It’s harder on some people to have to resign due to accidents, injuries or illnesses, instead of being dismissed for failures.</p><p>Kunugi-sensei’s an example. He complains about it in the pub all the time.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Oh, is that so? I’m not very familiar with Kunugi-sensei, so I had no idea!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Thought so. Children, please have more interest in Akiyan.</p><p>The masses are cruel, huh. They won’t even bat an eyelash, whatever happens to people who didn’t take first place…</p><p>Especially people from other industries, I think they’re not even aware of the incidental details.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I understand!

How many are there anyway? Aren’t there too many Kamen R*ders out there…? I feel bad for the villains.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. And then the villains start looking like the victims that you want to side with, huh?</p><p>Fighting for the weak against the strong! A hero always sides with those without power☆</p><p>…Ouch!?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn? Whoa, Morisawa… what happened to your arm? I just noticed, but you’ve got a really huge scrape there.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yes. Actually, I came to get this treated.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Say that sooner. Take off your top, I’ll take a look at it.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “O-Okay. I’ll undress, so please turn around for a bit.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Why? What’s there to be embarrassed about when we’re both guys… Weirdo.</p><p>Relax, I’m a doctor. C’mon, Chiaki-chan; put your hands up~♪”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “S-Stop, Sho*ker!

Then I’m very happy to have put that smile on his face.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Really.

Sometimes I think you can afford to push your limits more.</p><p>Keeping you kids protected in a glasshouse until you’re all grown may sound ideal on paper, but you’re gonna end up biting the dust as soon as you get out there.</p><p>So plug along and let failures help you grow, brats.</p><p>…okay, there you go. Head to your class, Morisawa. Take care.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Okay… Before that, may I ask a question?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn? Sure, what’s up? If it’s not too important, can it wait until after school?</p><p>Mornings are always so busy, I can’t keep dealing with just you.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Well, it’s about Project-Saga. Is it really an insignificant, low-budget project?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. Just a plan some old man I know made on a whim.</p><p>It’ll be serialized in a small corner of a magazine; a trivial story that doesn’t matter either way… or so I think. What’s bothering you?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right, so while I was doing stunt work, I overheard industry people bringing up the name ‘Project-Saga’ a lot.</p><p>It has a direct connection with me too now I’ve been officially welcomed into the team, so I leaned closer.</p><p>Apparently, they were talking about how a production agency somewhere is really interested in Project-Saga and may invest a lot of money in it.</p><p>Like, on the level of affecting stock prices and stuff. They were all treating the gossip very earnestly.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “An agency? I haven’t heard anything like that…</p><p>The writer that the magazine company sent for Project-Saga didn’t say anything of the sort either.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ah, they sent someone like that?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. I mean, the project is led by a magazine company, so we can’t just carry out things as we like.</p><p>There’s this kid from the company who’s gonna visit us periodically to check how we’re doing and write a report.</p><p>And then they’ll spruce up the report into an interesting article for the magazine. That’s all Project-Saga is.</p><p>A huge investment, huh… That’s more trouble than help.</p><p>We don’t even have anything to spend it on, no plans for huge spectacular live shows… I think that’s just baseless gossip.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Well… the people talking about it didn’t seem very certain, and it doesn’t sound realistic…</p><p>But when I brought this up in a conversation, the topic seemed to pique my classmate’s, Tenshouin’s, interest.</p><p><em>I knew they were making a move; time to come up with something on my end</em>…</p><p>…or so he said. I don’t know what he meant, though.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Huh. So Tenshouin said that… He’s been quiet these days, and I thought it’s because he was either sated or tired by DDD – but he’s started scheming again?</p><p>I’m feeling a little uneasy. Morisawa, if you’re good friends with Tenshouin, try to get more out of him.</p><p>However small it is in the eye of the public, this project is important to me because my benefactor is behind it… I don’t want weird schemes messing it up.</p><p>If there’s any funny business going on, I wanna get hold of it fast and crush any seeds of trouble before they bud.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right… Well, we’re on good enough terms for casual chats, so I’ll bring it up with him next time.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Haha. Actually, is there <em>anyone</em> who’s not on casual terms with you?</p><p>I’m envious of your gift with people; I didn’t have even a scrap of that ability as a youth.</p><p>Communication skill has more place than pure skill in the current era.

It’s just different from what I know, since Trickstar’s meetings don’t go like this.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ooh, so you guys <em>do</em> hold proper meetings.

It’s great how well you guys get along, but… that won’t work outside of your circle, so you should get used to the normal way.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, I thought the same. …again, I’m happy to have you in the team, Morisawa-senpai.</p><p>I’m still very much inexperienced, so I ask for your guidance and support.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Why, thanks for the warm welcome.

First of all, there’s something wrong with students belittling you. Be someone of respect, as a teacher should be.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Sure, sure… Anyway, we’re hectic from the get-go, but can I start the meeting already? Since everyone’s gathered.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah, I was wondering about that.

Look, here’s a cookie♪”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “I-I said you won’t convince me with sweets! Don’t treat me like a kid!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t say that. Look, we have konpeito too.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…? What is that? I’ve never seen it before. Don’t try to feed me something weird like… con-pei-toh? Which country is it from?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Fufu♪”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “W-Why did you laugh!? It feels like I’m being made a fool of! Gee~eez! I can’t stand this!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay okay, let’s end the games here. You guys came here in the middle of your busyness, so let’s be efficient and make the best use of the time we have.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right. Himemiya, I know you don’t like this, but sit tight and listen like a good boy. Tenshouin sent you here with something in mind, right?</p><p>So if you don’t carry out the role like he wished, you’re gonna be betraying his expectations of you. …or is it unfair of me to say that?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…Mmu. But I am absolutely not happy to do this, okay!? I don’t know what this Project-Saga is, but it’s so like circling on a roundabout!</p><p>Ahh geez! I just wanna get this over with and go back to <em>fine</em>’s lessons!”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah. And for that, we need to discuss our plans forward. Here, have more of these sweets♪”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Hey, why do you keep trying to feed me? Morisawa-senpai, right? You’re stepping out of line! Back off!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (Hmm, but that’s Morisawa-senpai for you. He’s skillfully leading Himemiya on. So that’s how you deal with his type… There’s a lot to learn from this.</p><p>Is it something like how I give Akehoshi ten yen coins to make him listen?</p><p>No… that only works because Akehoshi picks up on the cues and plays along. It’s something like our own little ritual.</p><p>It won’t work with just anybody.</p><p>I need to study up more on the sure-fire methods that work outside of Trickstar, or I won’t be able to survive in this harsh industry.</p><p>Project-Saga should be a good chance. Let’s see what lesson it can offer me on the know-how of idols.)</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “…Yeah, I see each of you have your own thinking. But since you’ve decided to partake, I’ll need you to work hard to some extent.</p><p>I pray that Project-Saga won’t really end up being a roundabout detour for you kids.</p><p>Once again, thank you very much for choosing to help out with this project.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmph. You’re being unusually upstanding, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Got to be, sometimes. Lowering my head is part of my job as an adult, and you guys gotta cultivate the habit of acting polite where it’s due, too.</p><p>Anyway, since this is our first meeting for the project… we’ll have introductions and discuss our plan going forward.</p><p>And there’s one more thing to decide first of all.</p><p>But wait, are you guys really fine with me at the helm? If anyone wanna be the coordinator, I don’t mind stepping down?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, you do it, Sensei. You’re the originator, so lead properly at least this once.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right. And a teacher is of course superior to students. Having one at the top and leading is the safest bet – or just the most natural way of things.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Mmu. Well, I’m still the most superior around here.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “On what basis? You put up a sweeter front back when you just enrolled; is this your true face?</p><p>Ah well. Then I’ll be leading. First things first, you guys have the basics of Project-Saga down pat, of course?</p><p>What about you, Himemiya? If you don’t know anything, I can give a loose summary.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “I’m okay… sir. I studied the proposal firsthand and asked the president and Yuzuru for things I didn’t know.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “The two of us were involved since the start of the project, so of course we grasp the overall idea.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I also don’t have any problem so far, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah, honor students. I could just sit back if every student were half as dutiful as you guys.</p><p>Anyway, you seem familiar enough with Project-Saga’s general idea, so I’ll be omitting some explanations.</p><p>First, I’ll go through our plans for the future, so if you have any questions, just pick a good time to speak, and say it.</p><p>Project-Saga is a whimsical project to be serialized in a weekly magazine by a staff member of said magazine company.</p><p>He isn’t here right now so I’ll have to leave his introduction for later, but I’ll be referring to him as our ‘Mr. Writer’ for convenience.</p><p>Mr. Writer will be visiting once a week to collect data for the week’s article or take photos for it.</p><p>Then he’ll write an article and finish it before the deadline, give it to us for the final check, and if there’s no problem, it’ll be put in the magazine.</p><p>The articles will be about the Legendary Idol… well, me.</p><p>About retired idols like me making a comeback and guiding the younger generation. He’ll be making a story out of it – a dramatization.</p><p>Like an inspirational teacher story? Or mentor-disciple story, was it?</p><p>Anyway, something like that will be held in several idol training schools and agencies all over the country, at the same time.</p><p>But for now, I’m the only Legendary Idol… the only retiree participating. So we’ll be the only ones featured.</p><p>If the negotiations go well, there will be more and more ‘mentor-disciples’ out there later.</p><p>And considering the number of pages, we’ll be less and less featured.</p><p>In other words, we won’t have to work too hard, eventually.</p><p>But since we’re the only ones right now, we need to come up with some sort of drama.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Even if you tell us to make drama… how does that happen, specifically?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ Hidaka, I heard you had a hard time gathering comrades. I think he’ll be making a dramatization out of that for starters.</p><p>Mr. Writer will probably visit you to ask some stuff later, so respond to him properly then.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. All right, I understand.”</p><h3 id="revival-5">Revival / 5</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “By the way, what kind of person is this writer?</p><p>We’ll probably be in for a long ride, so I’d like to know his basic profile from the outset.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Uh, he’s a young kid from a magazine company? Sorry, this little old man can’t tell apart kids of that age anymore.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Then how did you become a teacher, Sagami-sensei? Doesn’t your job demand an eye for people?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ When I was active, I could remember the face and name of each of my fans.</p><p>I think my head exploded from that and it shaved some cells off my brain. That’s why I’m so bad at remembering things now.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Hmph, I can’t believe you’ve gone senile at this age… sir.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No need to force yourself to speak politely. We’re kinda a makeshift, ragtag group here, but we’re still a team that’s gotta support one another.</p><p>Let’s speak frankly; that’s easier on me.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That helps me too, but is it really okay to be so… not serious?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “It’s fine, 's fine. This is a silly low-budget project, we’re just gonna tire ourselves out being stiff.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Mmu. Why do <em>I</em> have to get involved in such a cheap event…?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm. So this writer only visits once a week?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yup. Well, it’s always been common knowledge that magazines don’t sell; and they seem to have their human resources cut due to the publishing slump.</p><p>The magazine companies don’t have enough people to write their articles.</p><p>Mr. Writer seems to have it tough, writing a bunch of other articles despite being presumably a newbie.</p><p>So he can’t pour all his attention on just us or Project-Saga.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Hmph. Cheap plan, meager staff; this project can’t look any more low-budget.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Isn’t that nice though? Gives us a chance to work our way from square one. I think this kind of hard work is important too, Himemiya.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Smartypants… Anyway Morisawa, I still don’t get your previous question.</p><p>What’s wrong with Mr. Writer only coming once a week?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “No, it just sounds hard, writing an article based only on the data he got on that day.</p><p>If possible, how about we make our own activity report to be handed over when he comes?</p><p>I have only layman knowledge on magazines and articles so I’m not too sure, but wouldn’t the writing process be smoother with more materials?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Aah, right. Maybe we’re meddling too much, but when you put yourself in the shoes of the guy who has to write…</p><p>Having access to that kind of report sounds super handy.</p><p>Transfer Student, can you put together something like that – even just whenever you have time?</p><p>The rest of us need to actively work to have anything written at all, so it’ll help if we can leave this to you.</p><p>Well, we can’t decide this on our own, so we gotta confirm this with Mr. Writer first, of course.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Oh, the transfer student seems thrilled. Do you like writing this kind of thing?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. Come to think of it, you always scribble in your notepad for every little thing, Transfer Student.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Nn~ Well, that sounds like a job for servants. …Write me in a cute, positive light, okay?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahaha. We need to do proper work first before any reports or articles get written, though.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm. It’s a weekly magazine, so we’ll be serialized weekly too… and that means we need to do at least one thing every week, huh?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yup.</p><p>Well, we can also do one big thing that gets split up into several articles to save us a few weeks’ worth of work.</p><p>That, and your respective unit schedules, will be set for later discussion.</p><p>Let’s try to gather once a week… or at least somewhat regularly, if that’s hard.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Geh~ So this isn’t just a one-time thing? I’m sick of it already.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Don’t say that. I think it’s pretty fun, like gathering in a secret hideout.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, just enjoy the ride.</p><p>The content of our work is free for us to decide, as in the company didn’t make any particular demand, so… whaddya guys want?</p><p>I personally want us to do something relatively idol-like.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s incredibly vague. What’s idol-like? Live shows?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Lives are difficult, budget-wise… but a pseudo-live is possible.</p><p>All we need is to borrow the auditorium when no one’s using it and sing and dance there, after all.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Nn, but if we’re holding a live show, I wanna do it big and call lots of people in.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ohh, that’s great, Himemiya! Keep at it and assert your opinions more!”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “You’re such a pain! Stop getting in my hair!”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. Anyway, having a teacher for a member makes us an unusual case, but…</p><p>How about we register ourselves as a temporary unit?</p><p>Then we can submit proposals and receive funding from the student council when they’re accepted.</p><p>We can hold small live shows, so I think it’ll widen the variation of what we can do.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ I think budget should go to students, but that’s not a bad idea.</p><p>Honestly the funding from the magazine company is worth so little I don’t think it’ll take us anywhere.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Umm? Wait a second, what’s a ‘temporary unit’? We can only be part of one unit at a time, right?</p><p>Y-You’re telling me to resign from <em>fine</em>? I’m <em>never</em> doing that, you hear me!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Aah… that’s a term I miss. You don’t hear it a lot these days, but ‘temporary unit’ is a system that exists, huh.</p><p>It’s a unit formed temporarily for jobs that last for a limited period, right?</p><p>So we can be part of one without having to resign from our current units.</p><p>We still need to register for formation and get officially approved by the school, though.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Mm-hmm. Might be a good idea to give it a careful consideration. Heck, it’s convenient for moving along with Project-Saga.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…because…?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well. I said we have one thing to decide first of all, didn’t I?</p><p>Actually, the company asked us to decide on a name, a word to depict our team.</p><p>Which translates to ‘come up with a unit name!’, obviously.</p><p>‘Sagami Jin and His Disciples’ is unappealing on top of a mouthful, so apparently, it’s not ideal for writing articles.</p><p>So let’s take the chance to come up with an official name and make ourselves a temporary unit; write up a formation document, submit it, and get us that budget.</p><p>I bet that’s going to make future activities a whole lot easier.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. And it’s kind of idol-like. Stories about idols typically start with the characters coming up with a name, after all.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Do they? So you watch dramas other than tokusatsu, Morisawa?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha. TV dramas and books, actually… Consuming novels and comics – old or new, western or eastern – have been my hobby for a long time.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s a surprise; I guess you can’t judge a book by its cover… I also often read books on the the train to school, so maybe we’ll have a lot to talk about, Morisawa-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Oh, really? What genres do you like, Hidaka?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…I think we’ve strayed from the topic. Weren’t we thinking of a unit name?</p><p>I wanna get this over with so I can return to <em>fine</em>’s lesson, so focus!”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha, we got scolded. But Himemiya is right; let’s come up with a unit name first.</p><p>Anyone have a good idea?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… this is hard. I’m not very good with creative work.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Umm. I had almost nothing to do with idols until I enrolled here, so I don’t know much. How do people usually decide on unit names?</p><p>Do they all discuss it like this?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I wonder?</p><p>Ryuuseitai already existed since long before I enrolled, so I didn’t name it… I’m not too sure.</p><p>Hidaka, how did you guys decide on ‘Trickstar’?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Huh? I can’t remember.</p><p>We just had the name somehow. Who came up with it again…?</p><p>I think we were gathering like always, our talk heated up like always… and we just went ‘Let’s make it Trickstar!’ along the way?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha. That sounds like you guys alright.”</p><h3 id="revival-6">Revival / 6</h3><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm. You’re a freshman, Himemiya; I guess you don’t know where <em>fine</em> got its name?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Eh? I-I dunno… I think the members talked about the origin of the name <em>fine</em> in an article somewhere.</p><p>Something like ‘putting an end to the old era to create a new world’?</p><p>Fufu. When I first saw the name, I thought it was read fine as in <em>fain</em>.</p><p>I thought it sounded encouraging, optimistic and nice… For a while, I didn’t pick up that it was a musical term.</p><p>I practiced violin, so I <em>did</em> know the term.</p><p>But once you’re convinced something is read in a certain way, it sticks, and can be hard to fix.</p><p>Actually, I catch myself almost introducing myself as <em>fain</em> sometimes… Keep this a secret from President and the others, okay?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. …So you practiced the violin, Himemiya? My parents made me do it too.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Really? Wait Hidaka-senpai, are you actually from a well-off family? I’ve never seen you at social parties, though…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah, my parents probably go sometimes.</p><p>But we’re outsiders who moved in, so my parents probably hesitate to show up at events held by the prestigious families…”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Nn~ The people around here get pretty cliquish, yeah. My family is a newcomer too, so it can be uncomfortable.</p><p>They’re all old houses who insist they’ve owned the place since mythical times or something.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ooh, what a high-class conversation… And Sagami-sensei is the son of a big hospital too, so I’m the only one from a lower class. The difference in status hurts.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahaha. Aren’t people about how they live their life, not how they’re born? No idea though.</p><p>Anyway, we’re supposed to be thinking of a unit name. You guys really don’t have a good idea?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Nn~ Shouldn’t we come up with a name that suits our goal, like <em>fine</em>?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right. We have nothing in common after all; we can’t come up with a name based on the image of the members, the way Ra*bits did.</p><p>It’s hard to come up with a word that can describe our untidy group.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm, if we’re thinking backward from our goal…</p><p>We were gathered for Project-Saga, so… what? ‘Master-disciple’ but in English?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Nn~ It doesn’t strike a chord with me. The center of the project is Sagami… -sensei, so maybe we should start with him?</p><p>Sagami-sensei, what was your unit when you were active?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn? Nah, idol units weren’t a thing at all during my time.</p><p>Prolly hard to believe for you guys, who are completely saturated by the unit system, though.</p><p>I worked solo. Under the name ‘Sagami Jin’, so my real name.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Oh, so things used to be like that…?</p><p>I thought we can play around with Sagami-sensei’s unit name if he used to be part of a unit…</p><p>…since Project-Saga is all about reviving old idols for nostalgia effect, right?</p><p>So I thought it would be fitting to attach the name of the legendary idol; like, the fans might love it.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. Then why not pull it from Sagami-sensei’s name instead, or a title he had?</p><p>…Fufu. This kind of thinking game is fun, like a puzzle.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Eh~? But I don’t wanna arrange my name to sound cool and end up looking like a narcissist…</p><p>Isn’t it embarrassing? Like those usernames chuuni kids come up with.</p><p>Well, the name Project-Saga isn’t much different, though.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm. On the topic of Sagami-sensei’s title – that would be ‘Super Idol’, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right… We can make it plural into ‘Super Idols’ maybe?</p><p>But save for Sagami-sensei, we’re not exactly super idols yet, so we won’t be living up to the name…”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Eh~? That sounds so lame. Make it more like, fashionable and fancy!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahaha. I think idol stage names sound better cheap and over-the-top, though… or is this sentiment ancient?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ah, I got it! You were the Legendary Hero ‘Ryuusei Rainbow’, Sagami-sensei—</p><p>So how about we call ourselves ‘Rainbows’!?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Sounds lame!? What are we, a baseball team!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…I like it though. I mean, it’s the rainbow; doesn’t it sound pretty?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Eehh, what’s wrong with these people’s naming sense…? These are the guys I have to work with?</p><p>I don’t wanna keep worrying over the name though, so I don’t mind going ahead with that if you guys are sure.</p><p>Just don’t write it in katakana, 'kay? I think it will look <em>somewhat</em> better in alphabet, at least.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…hmm? The transfer student is holding up a notebook – I think she wants us to see.</p><p>Ooh… I was wondering what you’ve been fervently scribbling there… so you immediately put together a report, huh?</p><p>But since you’re a producer, you should join the discussion more instead of doing secretary work.</p><p>Mm-hmm. So you wrote down the unit name in alphabet as a test?</p><p>And even designed mockups for the logo already…?</p><p>That may be too soon. But a help anyway; we need to get a feel of how it looks.</p><p>…Mnn? ‘Rain-bows’? Where did the hyphen come from?</p><p>Ah, so it’s just a half-erased trace. But I think it’s nice; cutting it in the middle like that makes it seem meaningful.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Meaningful without an actual meaning. But that may be like us, in a way.</p><p>As if alluding to how we encountered each other by coincidence on the roundabout path we took.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Then we’re officially Rain-bows, is that okay?</p><p>If that’s decided, I’ll report it to our writer. And I’ll also do something about the formation proposal for our temporary unit on my end.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I have no problem with it, Sagami-sensei! However, I think we mustn’t trouble you with the proposal, so please let me do it!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, the transfer student says she wants to try her hand at it. She seems interested in writing a formation proposal, since she’s never made one before.</p><p>I think it’ll be good experience for her too, so please give her the chance.</p><p>Fufu. Rain-bows… will probably be the first unit you’ve truly made, won’t it?</p><p>And I’m honored to be part of it – even if I feel bad for Akehoshi and the others.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “I’m not too happy with the lame name, but…</p><p>Ah well, who cares. Can we end it here if there’s nothing left to discuss?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Sure. We decided what had to be decided, I said what had to be said.</p><p>Let’s gather again in a week or so. That’s all for today.</p><p>This should be enough circling on a roundabout; go back and move on with your original course. Thanks for today, everyone.</p><p>And I’m counting on you from now on, Rain-bows. Haha, to think I’ll have my first unit experience at this age, eh?”</p></div><footer class="post-footer"><div class="post-tags"><a href="/tags/Akira/" rel="tag"># Akira</a> <a href="/tags/ES-Spring/"
