by:</strong> Nishioka Maiko (Happy Elements KK)<br><strong>Timeline:</strong> Summer</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="chapter-1"><a href="#chapter-1">¶</a>Chapter 1</h2><p><strong>&gt; In front of the faculty office</strong></p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Excuse us, then~</p><p>Well, now we’re done returning the dance room key to the faculty. Let’s go home, Subaru.&quot;</p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/66p46iQ.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Geez, I can’t believe we had to stay out so late training for the sports festival with Chii-chan-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Whoa, it’s gotten pitch-black outside, huh?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Because we were training for like <em>three</em> competitions at once: ball-toss, scavenger hunt, and bread-snatching race. Feels like my entire body’s screaming.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Same. Training this hard right after summer break is really trying, isn’t it~?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;What was that scavenger hunt training about even? Won’t it all depend on the list we get <em>on</em> the competition?</p><p>What are we practicing if we don’t even know what we’ll get? I don’t get it~!&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yeah, and the captain came up with the most troublesome items. What was he expecting us to bring when he wrote ‘world peace’?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;I couldn’t help nodding when Takamin said <em>‘We’ll have world peace if you disappear, Morisawa-senpai.’</em></p><p><em>That</em>’s peace, alright.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Don’t say that. Captain’s always trying his best ― he’s just a little over-the-top.</p><p>But it was nice that we got to eat bread while training for the bread-snatching race♪ After school, your stomach just feels sorta empty, y’know?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Eeh~? I got sick of eating anpan!</p><p>Okay! I’m gonna ask Chii-chan-senpai to add jam bun and melonpan to the variation tomorrow!&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “C’mon now, don’t sponge off of the captain~”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…Nn?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “What’s wrong, Subaru?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Did you hear voices just now?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ehh? Don’t say spooky things. You think anyone else would stick around at this hour…?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? Wait, Sally, are you actually bad with scary stuff?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Nah, I’m pretty fine with it in manga and movies. I’m just reminded of that scary story the captain was recounting.</p><p>Doesn’t it sound realistic and creepy, coming from someone you know?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Aah, <em>that</em> story!</p><p>The one where Chii-chan-senpai saw Anzu in the school at night, and talked to her but she vanished without warning?&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “The captain ― he was trying to hide it, but he was really creeped out, wasn’t he~?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh, that was hiding it!? But it was so obvious that he was scared.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Yeah, but I think he was under the impression that he hid it well.</p><p>Anyway. It just sounded all the creepier to me that he told the story looking all scared, so――</p><p>Eek!? Is that a shadow there at that turn!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Wah~! It’s Anzu! Yahhoo, yahhoo☆”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “What, so it’s you guys. Akehoshi and Forehead.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “So you two are still at school too.”</p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/1eef4h7.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “And Gami-san and Occhan! Fancy seeing the three of you at this hour☆ What’s going on, guys?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Well, y’know how UNDEAD’s been having a bunch of live shows lately?</p><p>So we were practicing even more intensely than usual. We bumped into Anzu just as we were about to go home.&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Anzu said she came to get something she’d forgotten in the classroom. We are accompanying her because it’s late.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh~ Then we’ll tag along with you too, Anzu! ‘<em>In travelling, companion; in life, compassion</em>’, isn’t it?♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Not exactly a ‘travel’ considering the distance, but they’ve started to turn off the lights in some places, so it’s probably better that we all stick together.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I can see well in the dark, but it’s true that it is safer with more people. Having you all around will be reassuring.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Then, let’s just get moving.</p><p>Tch, man, it’s so much more annoying with a crowd. Hey Anzu. Don’t be forgettin’ your stuff! Are you a dolt?</p><p><em>‘I’m sorry’</em>? Well, can’t do nothin’ about what already passed. Just don’t repeat it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;That’s what Kouga said, but――</p><p>What he actually means is ‘<em>The night streets are full of dangers, so a girl shouldn’t wander without company</em>’. Don’t sweat it, Anzu.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Wrong! Forehead, stop pulling shit out of nowhere!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “There you go, you’re so not honest with yourself, Gami-san~♪ Poke, poke♪”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “True. Oogami has a kind heart, but it is hard to see because he is not honest.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Adonis, you bastard! And Akehoshi, stop poking my side!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “But Gami-san, you almost don’t say it anymore these days, right? That ‘<em>Are we friends? We’re not, right?</em>’ stuff. You used to say that everytime.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “That must mean he considers us friends now.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Uuuugh! Gaaaaaaah! Stop getting the wrong idea!</p><p>I’m a proud, lone wolf! I’m not gonna get touchy-feely with anyone!&quot;</p><p>.</p><p><strong>&gt; Hallway</strong></p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/OF6kZdW.jpg"></p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “There ya go, Anzu. We’re in front of the classroom. Go get your stuff.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Stay safe, Anzu☆ We’ll wait out here!”</p><p>&lt; Ten minutes later &gt;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;…</p><p>Say, Anzu ― isn’t she taking her time in the classroom? Does picking up something you forgot usually take this long?&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I guess… she <em>is</em> taking a little long.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Haa? Isn’t she just having trouble searchin’ for her stuff?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;…You don’t think she vanished on us, do you?</p><p>She can’t be the ghost Anzu that the captain was talking about…?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eeh~? You don’t say~!”</p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/0RlFD85.jpg"></p><h2 id="chapter-2"><a href="#chapter-2">¶</a>Chapter 2</h2><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, there she is! You’re so late, Anzu~ We were worried.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I see. You couldn’t find what you forgot where you thought you left it, and you had trouble looking. I’m glad you found it in the end.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Hey, you’re the real Anzu, right?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Gee, Sally. You made Anzu confused with your question.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Oi, what’re you guys going on about? What’s the whole deal about Anzu vanishing?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Well, Chii-chan-senpai said he ran into Anzu in the kitchen of the garden terrace one night, but then Anzu vanished on him.</p><p>And suddenly too, like a ghost.</p><p>That’s why we thought that Anzu might’ve vanished in the classroom.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Sounds dumb. You sure he wasn’t just sleepy and seeing things?</p><p>The vampire bastard often mistook me for his lil’ brother when he’s half-asleep too, draggin’ me into his coffin and stuff.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Ahaha, those two brothers are horrid sleepers, huh~</p><p>Anyway, don’t make such a difficult face, Anzu.</p><p>I’m sure you’re curious about a ghost who looked exactly like you, but it really might’ve been the captain seeing things.</p><p>I shouldn’t be saying that since I doubted you? Okay, so I was wrong. I won’t doubt you again, I swear.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Gami-san and Occhan don’t seem to get scared by ghost stories, huh?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Nope. One of the twins from the light music club… Hinata, he tries scaring me with ghost stories all the time, but it’s all fiction anyways.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I am concerned that physical attack may not work in case of ghostly encounters, but… I am not afraid of ghosts themselves.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Uh, don’t try to get into fight with ghosts.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha☆ You’re hilarious, Occhan♪”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “But it was in the garden terrace that the Anzu ghost popped up? Today, Hinata was sayin’ about a rumor of fireball sighting in the garden terrace, too.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I have heard of the fireball rumor as well. It seems to be part of the ‘Seven Mysteries of Yumenosaki Academy’. A classmate was talking about it.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh? What’s that, what’s that? Lemme in!”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;So, there’s this student who saw a fireball floating around the garden terrace at night.</p><p>But then the fireball suddenly came flying at him at great speed.</p><p>He closed his eyes before it hit, but even though he waited, he couldn’t feel any heat.</p><p>He opened his eyes and the fireball was already gone.</p><p>Though he got out unharmed, the hem of his uniform had a mysterious burned mark, they say.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “O-Oi, cut it out~ I’m getting chills listening to a ghost story in this darkness.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “You scared, man? Gyahahaha, what a loser!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Shut up. I can’t help what creeps me out.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Hmm, the garden terrace, huh…</p><p>Hey, let’s go see what the rumors are about!</p><p>Nah, let’s not just see but <em>catch</em> the fireball! I bet it’s all shiny and sparkling!&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;A fireball won’t exactly be sparkling but <em>blazing up</em>, y’know…? No, wait. That’s not the important part.</p><p>Subaru, I’m begging you, stop coming up with weird ideas on the spot. For real.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Hah! What a pain in the ass. Count me out. I wasn’t too excited about this whole chaperoning business in the first place.</p><p>Akehoshi, if you really wanna take a look, you can go on your own.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “No way, I wanna go with you guys! You don’t come across a fireball twice, right? What if you let this chance slide?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “I’d rather not come across it for life, seriously.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Geez, don’t be so boring, Sally. Wouldn’t you like to see it, Occhan, Anzu? The fireball!”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> &quot;Hmm. Fire is considered holy in my motherland, I believe. If I do manage to see it, it may bring me fortune…</p><p>But it’s already late. Is it not dangerous?&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;He’s right, Subaru. We have Anzu with us right now. Let’s give up for today.</p><p>Right? You wanna go home, don’t you, Anzu?</p><p>Eh? You’d like to take a look? Since you might find out the truth about the ghost who looked like you?</p><p>Well, it’s true both stories happened in the garden terrace.</p><p>Seriously~? Hey, Anzu, can’t you think it over~? I get that you’re probably curious about it, but… You’re surprisingly a stubborn one, aren’t ya?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Anzu, I love you~♪ Let’s hug! <em>Gyuu</em>-_gyuu_☆ Right!? Of course you’ll be curious, right?</p><p>Leave it to me, Anzu! I’ll definitely catch both the fireball <em>and</em> the ghost Anzu!☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;C’mon, let go of her, Subaru. Sexual harassment <em>is</em> sexual harassment regardless of your intention, 'kay?</p><p>(<em>sighs</em>)… Okay, you win. I can’t let Subaru and Anzu go by themselves. I’m going too.&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Then I will also come. It will be safer with someone to protect you. I’m the most suitable for that role in this group.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Haa!? So you’re all going anyway!?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “You can’t stop Subaru and Anzu when they’re like this. ‘<em>In for a penny, in for a pound</em>’, I guess? Aah, spare me the troublesome stuff, really.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I love you, Sally, Occhan~♪ I’ll give you a hug!”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> &quot;Don’t mind it. Fortunately, I have called home to say that I will be late because of practice. I don’t have to hurry home to do the chores today.</p><p>I will protect all of you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Subaru, don’t lean your entire weight on me~ You’re heavy.</p><p>You’ve really got to stop acting on whims. I’ll have Hokuto scold you if you’re too selfish, got it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Sally, you meanie!</p><p>Well, so we’re all heading for the garden terrace, but what about you, Gami-san~?</p><p>Are you going home alone? Or are you coming with us? I wish we can all go together~&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Stop looking at me like you expect me to come with you.</p><p>Aaugh, fine, blast it. I just need to go, right?</p><p>I’m going. What a drag!&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yay! Thanks, Gami-san☆”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Akehoshi, don’t cling to me like we’re close! You’re annoying! Shoo-shoo!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Okay then! We’re departing for the garden terrace, guys!

What if the fireball decides to grant your wish and come out?</p><p>Mnn? What, Anzu? Aah ― it’s okay, I’m fine. With this many people, I’m not as scared as I say.</p><p>Anyway, I sure hope our adventure ends with nothing happening. Thanks for worrying about me, Anzu.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Gee, you’re such a scaredy-cat, Sally! You’re scared because you keep saying it’s scary!</p><p>Times like these, you’ve got to laugh off the fear! Ahahaha~☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ah, that really sounds like the captain.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh, you’re kidding me!? No way~ Chii-chan-senpai’s the only one I don’t wanna be lumped together with~!”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Akehoshi, you’re bein’ damn noisy! Stop your yip-yap!</p><p>Anyway, I think there’s no one in this building.</p><p>My nose picks up smell better than most people, so I can tell when there’s someone nearby. I say we probably won’t be findin’ any ghosts or fireballs either?</p><p>Ha? What is it, Anzu? ‘<em>Would a ghost smell</em>’ you ask?</p><p>Why would I know, never even seen one before. That was just what my instincts said. Instincts.</p><p>Whoa! Don’t stumble, Anzu! You’re such a handful. Good that I caught your arm immediately.&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “There is barely any lighting around these parts. Everyone, watch your steps. Unlevel stairs may be hard to see.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “By the way, Occhan, what are the other things in that Yumenosaki Seven Mysteries you were saying?”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I only heard about the fireball. Do you know about the other Seven Mysteries, Oogami?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Haa? Hinata said something about… I think there was…</p><p>The Bach portrait growing a long hair, the piano playing on its own――</p><p>And then the sobs of a female student that can be heard from the rooftop at night, or something…?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hmm, so rooftop, portrait and piano~♪ Those sound interesting too!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Piano, huh…? Maybe that’s actually Ritsu?♪ That guy wanders around the school at night a lot~</p><p>You know what they say ― when you look carefully, it’s always something more ordinary than you’d think♪ &quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “And the female student at the rooftop is Sakuma-senpai? He has long hair, after all.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha, Sakuma-senpai also sticks around the school at night, so maybe you’re not off the mark. It’s not so scary when I think of it like that♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “But it’s strange to have a story about female student in Yumenosaki, huh? We only have Anzu.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Right, and I’d heard the Yumenosaki Seven Mysteries have existed before Anzu transferred here.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I guess the Sakuma-senpai theory for the rooftop ghost is pretty plausible?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;What’s wrong, Anzu? The female student wasn’t Sakuma-senpai?</p><p>Huh, you sure seem to know a lot. You have an idea about it?</p><p>Wawa―!? Anzu, don’t suddenly shake your head like that.</p><p>‘<em>I don’t know anything</em>’? Okay, okay, I got it so calm down. You’re making yourself look even more suspicious.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Keh, who cares if it’s a ghost or Ritchi or the vampire bastard. I don’t give a shit.</p><p>I don’t get what’s so scary about ghost stories. They’re just stories.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nn? Come to think of it, does anything scare you, Gami-san? It can be ghosts or roller coasters or bugs or snakes.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Haa? Nope, nada. What makes you think I’ll have one? Don’t take me for a joke!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “But everyone has a thing or two they’re scared of, right? Normally.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Get off my case. Look, I’m a great noble wolf. Who’s gonna take me seriously if lil’ things can scare me?</p><p>Heheh♪ If you <em>really</em> wanna give me a fright, show me a dinosaur the size of a mountain.&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> &quot;Hmm. Something Oogami fears…</p><p>I recall that Oogami was frightened when an angry Sakuma-senpai punished him before. I’m sorry for not coming to your rescue back then.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “What useless shit are you recalling, dumbass!? You askin’ to be knocked flying!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha☆ So the thing Gami-san’s scared of is an angry Sakuma-senpai~♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “I’m impressed you got Sakuma-senpai angry. What did you do?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Leave it. I don’t remember anymore.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> &quot;The air cooler in Sakuma-senpai’s coffin broke because Oogami was making a mess in the clubroom.</p><p>Because of that, he couldn’t sleep inside the coffin for some time ― I guess even Sakuma-senpai would get angry over that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Daaaaaah! Damn you, Adonis! Don’t just go spilling the beans!</p><p>I broke the vampire bastard’s exhaust fan when I was acting out a kung fu movie with the twins, is all.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Eh? That coffin has an exhaust fan?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Yeah, somewhere hard to see.</p><p>Anyway, he got really angry, but I mean, I said sorry and called someone to fix it. It’s all in the past.</p><p>Plus, Adonis! You gotta confess what scares <em>you</em> first before blabbin’ about someone else’s!&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You don’t look like anything could scare you, Occhan. You’re strong, and I might’ve never seen you being caught off guard? Do you have any fear?”</p><h2 id="chapter-4"><a href="#chapter-4">¶</a>Chapter 4</h2><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “My fear? …If you must ask, I would say it is my sisters.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Huh? You’re more scared of your sisters than of ghosts?”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Isara, you must not underestimate my older sisters. They are far more terrifying than any ghosts.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “What are they like, Occhan?”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> &quot;When they find something they do not like, they would conspire with each other and tyrannize me.</p><p>But they got into a fierce dispute the other day, so I asked what was the problem.</p><p>They ended up prattling on about their minor gripes with each other that should be past; clothes being borrowed without permission, ice creams in the fridge getting eaten…</p><p>Since the fight only became more heated beyond my control, I tried to leave, but…</p><p>They all caught me before I could, and made me judge who was in the wrong.</p><p>I couldn’t pick any of them. Somehow, that ended up settling the fight, leading them to gang up on me like always…&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “W-Well… How should I put this… You have my condolences, but would you really say they’re scarier than ghosts?”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “They <em>are</em> scarier than ghosts. If you tell me to pick between fighting against a tiger or my older sisters, I will choose to fight the tiger.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Are your sisters amazonesses?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha, now you’ve got me curious. I wanna see your sisters, Occhan♪”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I would advise against that.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Still, it’s so rare to hear you talk in length, Otogari~”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Yes, I am not good at talking. But maybe I am feeling excited, to go on an adventure with you all.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah yeah, I get you, Occhan. Doesn’t wandering around the school at night just thrill you?☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “But I’m the opposite of thrilled?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Geez! Sally, you scaredy-cat!”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Hey, Akehoshi. Don’t just poke at people’s fears, you gotta put your fears out there too. You’re not bein’ fair.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Me? Lemme see~… Hmm~…”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “There’s gotta be <em>something</em>, right?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, I love sparkling things!”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “No shit, I was talkin’ about what you’re scared of! Not what you love!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Gee, it’s just a little joke.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “But you don’t seem like you’re scared of anything, Subaru. Scary stories don’t affect you, and you seem perfectly fine with the school’s night scenery.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “You are strong, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Hmm, you think so?</p><p>…&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “…?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “AAH!! That’s right!”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Eeeek!? Ba-Bastard, don’t just shout outta the blue! You gave me a shock!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Sorry, sorry. So you get surprised by people suddenly shouting, huh?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Gaaaaaah! You tryin’ to pull a fast one on me!? Who wouldn’t get surprised by sudden loud sounds!?”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Oogami, calm down. So Isara, did you realize something?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Ah right, this isn’t time to be messing with Kouga.</p><p>Well, I was thinking that the garden terrace would be locked around this hour.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh!? You mean we wouldn’t be able to go inside, even though we’ve come this far!? That’s awful~! What should we do?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Hmm, no choice but to go get the key, I think? But it’s scary~</p><p>Sorry, Subaru, can you run and get the key? You’ll be fine by yourself, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh!? Uhh~… That’s a bit…”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “…? What’s wrong, Subaru?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Uh~…”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> &quot;Ah, Akehoshi, Isara. You don’t have to worry about that.</p><p>We borrowed a spare key in case Anzu needed it to get what she forgot in the classroom. We should be able to enter the garden terrace with this.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Really? That’s great~☆ It’s thanks to you forgetting your stuff, Anzu♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ugh… When you think about how I end up in this predicament because she’d forgotten her stuff, I’m not sure if I should chalk that up to good or bad timing.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Hah! Too bad. Brace yourself for it already. You’re so pathetic, Forehead!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Look, you, just because you’re not scared…”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “In any case, we will arrive at the garden terrace soon, so what do we do? Should we start with the kitchen where ghost Anzu was sighted?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;What’s wrong, Anzu? Suddenly stopping on your track. And your face is white as sheet. Are you okay?</p><p>W-What’s wrong!? What’s throwing you off? <em>'Look over there</em>’? Where? The garden terrace?&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “W-What is that light?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Eeek!? W-What’s that orange light? It’s floating in the garden terrace!?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Oi, oi! Something <em>really</em> came out!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hyahoo☆ Fireball detected! Let’s get going, guys!

I’m gonna fall, I’m gonna fall!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Uukh… It’s darker than I thought inside the garden terrace.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Is the fireball here?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I don’t see anything. I don’t hear any whoos or boos either. It’s dark and quiet.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “You don’t think ghosts really come out with that kind of theatrics?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “What’s that matter? It’s that light we saw we’re lookin’ for here.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I wonder where it could’ve gone? The light was floating in the garden terrace interior, right?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “It vanished? Tch, feels like a fox played tricks on me.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “What to do next? Do we look for it?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Nah, isn’t it enough already? Okay, Subaru? You’re satisfied, right? We can’t keep looking for it forever, so let’s end it here and go home――</p><p>Ah! Don’t just start looking!&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Let’s search the garden terrace interior at least? It might be hidden behind something.</p><p>I’ll give up if we come up with nothing! Pretty please?&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “(<em>sighs</em>) …Okay! We’ll just search around these parts, and then go home! Promise me this?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Yeah, I promise☆ Let’s split up and search the garden terrace, guys!</p><p>I’ll take here and over there!&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Then I shall go with Anzu. It is dangerous in this darkness. The moonlight does not make it safe enough.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Guys, just don’t get yourselves hurt, okay~?</p><p>Ooi, Kouga. Care to go to the kitchen with me? We can just take a peek then leave.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Haa? Why do <em>I</em> have to go to with <em>you</em>?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “You’re fine with scary stuff, right? I just want to take a look and get out of here fast~ Please~ Okay? I’m begging you here!”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Don’t beg me! Stop acting like a joke; aren’t you a man!? Don’t you have any pride?</p><p>Tch, what a drag! C’mere, Forehead!

The portrait of Bach growing a long hair too!?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> &quot;That one was~ because I accidentally sprinkled chalk dust on the painting, probably.</p><p>When I took it to the back of the school in secret so I could beat the dust out, a student happened to see me.</p><p>Seemed like the chalk dust made it look like his hair grew out. It became a story of how I exorcised the painting’s ghost behind the school building. Ahaha.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh~? Do people really make that kind of mistake?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Don’t ask me. It’s not my fault they came up with that story.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Then what about the Anzu ghost sighted in the garden terrace?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “What’s that? Anzu, you were a ghost?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ah no, the capta… Morisawa-senpai said he ran into an Anzu ghost in the garden terrace.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> &quot;Aah, I remember him saying something like that. About seeing Anzu there?</p><p>But I didn’t see her so I can’t say~? You weren’t in the kitchen that time, right Anzu?</p><p>Well, that’s just how it is. You should know after seeing how Isara was like: When people get into a state of panic, they lose the calm to make a sound judgment~</p><p>Morisawa was really scared, so wasn’t he just seeing things?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “The piano playing on its own and the female student at the rooftop were also you, Sagami-chan?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahh~ That’s not me… but someone I know. Don’t worry; they’re human.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Bummer… I feel silly after knowing the truth.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “I’m relieved~♪”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Keh! So I was right; ghosts don’t exist!”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “It’s a little unfortunate. If they exist, I was hoping to see them.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> &quot;Anyway. You’re satisfied, right?</p><p>I’ll take the spare key and return it, so out you go. Dismissed, dismissed~&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Let’s go back home, guys. Good night, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Sagami-chan, bye-bye~☆”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “See ya~ Take care on the way home, you kids~”</p><p>(I only started smoking in the garden terrace right before Akehoshi and Oogami came, but…</p><p>I guess I better keep the secret to myself.</p><p>Can’t be fanning their curiosity carelessly, or they might disrupt my peaceful night rest like today♪)</p><h2 id="chapter-8"><a href="#chapter-8">¶</a>Chapter 8</h2><p><strong>&gt; Path to school</strong></p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/UObVf0T.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “So there really was no ghost♪”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “You look happy, Isara.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;The whole day it felt like ten years were subtracted from my lifespan, y’know? Now that I’ve been freed from the scary experience, I’m in bliss~♪</p><p>Ahh, the average everyday is so wonderful♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;To think the mysteries were all on Sagami-chan~ It’s pretty boring to have the truth uncovered.</p><p>The best part of an adventure is really when you have no clue what’s going on, I guess.&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “In any case, while many things did happen, I had a lot of fun. I would even like to go for another test of courage sometime.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Oi, gimme a break~! Let’s forget about tests of courage and play around in peace, like normal!</p><p>Sometime after school, maybe? We can drop by somewhere, go shopping, or go to the karaoke again with these members.&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Yes. I will be looking forward to that.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Keh! Don’t decide that for me. I’m not going.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Don’t say that~ You’re a member of the Yumenosaki Seven Mysteries Investigation Team too, Kouga♪”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Don’t suddenly conscript me into your weird group! I’m gonna bite you to death!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Then, let’s all have a sleepover today!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “There you go again! I said stop coming up with things on the spot, didn’t I?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;But it’s lonely to just part ways here! I wanna play more and more with you guys!</p><p>A sleepover isn’t scary or dangerous at all! Okay? Okay? I implore you, Sally-sama!&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nope. I’m not gonna bend this time.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Sally’s being a spoilsport! Where did the kind Sally go?</p><p>Ah, are you actually a ghost pretending to be Sally? Give me back my Sally!&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Stop clinging to me, Subaru. You won’t make me nod.</p><p>Look, it’s already late. You need to go home too, Anzu. Should I walk you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Isara, if you’re taking Anzu home, I will come as well.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Really? You’re a help~♪”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Akehoshi. I will definitely free up my schedule, so let’s play again when we both have time. We can have a sleepover too.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Alright then, we’re both going this way. Subaru, Kouga, see you tomorrow! Bye-bye~☆”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Ahh… Sally’s group left… Ugh~…</p><p>Gami-saaaaan!&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Uwoh!? Akehoshi, don’t leap at me with that much power! What the hell!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You’ll have a sleepover with me, won’t you, Gami-san!?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “The shit? Why do <em>I</em> have to go along with Akehoshi’s whims!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Recall the bonds we’ve woven, Gami-san~! Aren’t we buddies?♪”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “And how’s that enough reason!? First off, stop riding on my shoulders! Just go play with Daikichi or something!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Of course Daikichi will be with me, but I’ll be even happier if Gami-san and Leon also come♪</p><p>Wolves are nocturnal, right? So you’re still full of energy, right? I’m not gonna let go until you give me the okay! <em>Gyuu~☆</em>&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “DAAAAAAH! Akehoshi, you bastard! Don’t mess with me!
