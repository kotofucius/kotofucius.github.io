No, maybe it’s more lively compared to when I was here?</p><p>…Everyone is smiling.</p><p>…That’s great.</p><p>… …)</p><p>“…? Do you need something from me? Yes, you.</p><p>…Eh, Anzu-san? The producer, Anzu-san?</p><p>…You came here to pick me up?</p><p>…Wait.</p><p>…(<em>intently reading from some kind of booklet</em>)</p><p>…Thanks for waiting. Umm—</p><p>‘Good work coming to get me.’</p><p>‘I am the ruler of Shuuetsu Academy, Ran Nagisa of Adam.’</p><p>…Pause.</p><p>‘All idols besides me shall fall to ruins.’</p><p>…Ah, wait.</p><p>…It says I should make the most intimidating face I could muster. And laugh loudly too, it seems?</p><p>…I’ll redo. Sorry, okay?</p><p>‘Fuhahahaha! All idols besides me shall fall to ruins!’</p><p>‘There is no path before me, for my trail <em>makes</em> the path! I am the most sublime king! The eternal idol!’</p><p>‘Kneel, plebeians! Before the radiance of Ran Nagisa! Fuhahahaha!’</p><p>…Nailed it! (<em>victory pose</em>)</p><p>…Ah, sorry. I must’ve surprised you. You see, I’m in the middle of forming my character.</p><p>…But since I’m not used to it yet, I’m practicing.</p><p>…I resigned from idol activities for a while, you see.</p><p>…Wandering around foreign countries for a little self-seeking journey.</p><p>…But that made me lose sight of my ‘self’ instead.</p><p>…To the point I even forgot how to speak Japanese.</p><p>…But Hiyori-kun told me. ‘Let’s do our best together again.’</p><p>…So I came back. To this country.</p><p>…Honestly, I don’t feel like it.</p><p>…Now and then, the idol industry is always so brutal.</p><p>…I dislike participating in feuds, you see.</p><p>…I wonder why we can’t all be friends.</p><p>…I wonder, why we can’t all love and sympathize with one another.</p><p>…Even though we’re all family, born to the same planet.</p><p>…Maybe it’s because we’re weak?</p><p>…Ah, sorry. That’s not something I should ask you, Anzu-san.</p><p>…Umm, will you lead me to the student council room?</p><p>…Yeah, I was thinking to drop by for a greeting before Autumn Live.</p><p>…It seems it’ll be held in our territory,</p><p>…so maybe it’s more suitable that <em>they</em> come to greet us.</p><p>…But I wasn’t in the country for some time.</p><p>…So I wanted to see, feel, and grasp the current state of Yumenosaki.</p><p>…And I thought it’s just proper to be coming for a greeting since we’re going to borrow the Yumenosaki kids.</p><p>…I need to see Eichi-kun, too.</p><p>…He’s kind of a schemer, that one. I need to have a look at his face myself, to find out what he’s thinking.</p><p>…Plus, it’s going to be awkward to meet him after everything is over.</p><p>…So I’m thinking of apologizing <em>before</em> the event.</p><p>…Trickstar, is it? The group we’re doing a joint live with.</p><p>…I want to tell him – I’m sorry if I end up breaking those kids.</p><p>… …</p><p>…What’s wrong? Please, lead the way to the student council.</p><p>…I used to go to Yumenosaki too, but I’ve forgotten most things about it.</p><p>…If you won’t take me there, I’ll get lost.</p><p>…I get lost easily – no, I get swept easily.</p><p>…Maybe I’m too empty? I seem to be missing many things.</p><p>…So, I trust you to lead the way.</p><p>…Come on? Let’s go.</p><p>…Umm.</p><p>…Sorry, what was your name again?”</p><h2 id="the-fruit-of-knowledge">The Fruit of Knowledge</h2><p><strong>&gt; Adam Personal Parlor</strong></p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Pardon!</p><p>Saegusa Ibara, arriving to relay a message! Do excuse the intrusion during your busy time!</p><p>However, I ask that you lend me your ears for five – no, even just a minute!</p><p>I promise no loss! Salute~!”</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/9I3thQQ.jpg"></p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Ibara.</p><p>…What’s wrong?</p><p>…I don’t get it, but wait.</p><p>…I’ll finish reading in a little while.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Understood! I shall wait!</p><p>Except Your Excellency’s ‘little while’ can last up to three days or even a week, so standing at attention until you are done does bring me quite a few worries!</p><p>However, if that is an order! Then Saegusa Ibara, your humble servant, shall wait even if it rains water or spears!</p><p>Subordination! Fealty! Service! A-ha-ha♪”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I don’t need servants.</p><p>…What I want is an equal I may love.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Copied! If that is your wish, then I shall work hard to behave like so!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…You’re a hard worker, Ibara.</p><p>…Okay. Sorry for the wait. I’m done reading so I’ll hear you out. What is it?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Ooh, wonderful! Fine weather comes to those who wait…☆”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Fine weather – is that about Hiyori-kun? He’s coming?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “A-ha-ha♪ I’d expect no less, Your Excellency – such interesting things you say! Ahh, my stomach hurts! I’m dying, I’m dying~!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…When you exaggerate like that, it feels like you’re making fun of me.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Pardon! It’s a habit! In this country, where weapons are banned, the act of non-violence and subordination are the greatest strategy to survival!</p><p>Slay with praise and kill with looks! The customer is god! A-ha-ha♪”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Do you want to kill me?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Ridiculous! I need you to live a long life, Your Excellency! For the sake of my long term plan <em>and</em> the future of the idol industry!</p><p>In any case! I would feel sorry to waste your time with idle chat when you prematurely ended your reading for me!</p><p>So I shall state my business!</p><p>As per usual, I have finished coming up with Your Excellency’s lesson schedule to match with Eden’s coming plans!</p><p>Please run your eyes through it! Here you go~☆ (<em>offers a booklet</em>)”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Ah, thanks for always, Ibara.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Oh no, no need to thank me! To be of service to Your Excellency is my joy! Nay, I was born for that very reason!</p><p>Anyway, to sum it up, I came up with this training menu based on Your Excellency’s recent state and Eden’s schedule!</p><p>Steps are taken and all is set!</p><p>Your muscle ratio has slightly deviated from measurement, so let us work towards returning the balance!</p><p>Take a look at this line graph! See? We must accentuate your abdomen more and slim down your shoulders!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> &quot;…Aah, so I did end up gaining more muscle on my shoulders and back.</p><p>…Just recently, I unearthed some interesting things from a dig site neighbor, you see.</p><p>…As the discoverer, I was given a chance to examine just one on my own.</p><p>…I thought I mustn’t break it, so I carried it myself, and I guess I gained muscles because of that.</p><p>…I grow up very fast, after all.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> &quot;How wonderful! You are undergoing growth spurt even at this age, Your Excellency!</p><p>But I still don’t understand that hobby of yours.</p><p>That excavated artifact you speak of is <em>that</em>, yes? That thing in the corner, which appears to be a stone pillar carved with mysterious writings?</p><p>It does look to have cultural and historical value, but no artistic or monetary one, as far as I can see?&quot;</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Archaeology is romance. You can’t assign value to dreams.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> &quot;A difference between our sense of values, then? Archaeology requires money anyway, and instead of digging up layers of the past, I wish to build a bridge towards the future!</p><p>Not that I desire to object to Your Excellency’s hobby!&quot;</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> &quot;…Yes. It’s work, and you did your best thinking up the schedule and such, Ibara.</p><p>…So I’ll do my best to obey. But personally, I want to use my time for my hobbies more.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> &quot;<em>Obey me</em>? You jest! All I wish is to aid Your Excellency to reach greater heights, for you are the entertainment industry’s greatest asset!</p><p>I wish that you don’t doubt the sincerity of my feelings – my <em>loyalty</em>!&quot;</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…It’s fine, you know. I don’t mind being used as you see fit.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> (Hmmm. Servile as ever – or rather, he has none of the pride or dignity that tends to come with gift.</p><p>He readily obeys me without having to be talked into it, just like a baby.</p><p>Yet his work rate, output quality, and learning ability are far more than the average human can dream to have.</p><p>I see books piled up high in the corner that I don’t believe were there when I checked up on him in the morning…</p><p>But he must’ve finished perusing them all and even has their entire content remembered.</p><p>What an average man needs years to learn, he can digest in the span of a day or so.</p><p>Yet, he uses that ability to examine an artifact of no value.</p><p>Aah, what a waste! I must utilize his natural attributes, his talents, more beneficially!</p><p>I must give them back to the world! He is sitting on a gold mine!</p><p>Fortunately, this fearsome ‘weapon’ is in my hands!</p><p>I, Saegusa Ibara, shall utilize you to the fullest! With all my love and utmost caution…!)</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…What’s wrong? You’re grinning; did something good happen?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “No, no! I am merely relishing in the joy and fortune of having met you, Your Excellency! Aah, what a blessed man I am…☆”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> &quot;…I see. Few have told me that, so that makes me happy.</p><p>…I hope you’ll stay my friend, Ibara.</p><p>…Also, the documents here aren’t enough. Go and supply me with the books I’ve listed in this memo.</p><p>…Until they’re delivered, I’ll train like you tell me to.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> &quot;Yes! Then please do that!</p><p>All for the sake of our brilliant future! Charge! Raid! Conquest! A-ha-ha ♪&quot;</p><h2 id="former-kings">Former Kings</h2><p><strong>&gt; Near the Fountain</strong></p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Hello.</p><p>…I seem to run into you quite a lot. Umm… Anzu-san, was it?</p><p>…It seems we’re tied through something.</p><p>…Ah, can you wait a bit? I might need to redo; I forgot to act in-character.</p><p>…Eh? I don’t need to? It just confuses you?</p><p>…Does it. I’m glad to hear that, actually. It’s tiring to force myself to act like somebody else.</p><p>…Anyway, I’m sorry, but can you take me to the student council office?</p><p>…Yet again, I forgot how to get there. I’m sorry for troubling you again.</p><p>…A chauffeur Ibara assigned to me took me until the Yumenosaki front gate.</p><p>…But if I recall correctly, it’s against rules to bring vehicles within the school grounds.</p><p>…Eh? It’s fine to bring motorbikes and cars inside now?</p><p>…Ah, I see. They reformed the rules. That slipped my mind completely.</p><p>…I’m so hopeless. I need to remember to renew my memory more often.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Oh? Uwaah! Is that you, Nagisa-kun?”</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/kQnQB44.jpg"></p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Nn? Ah, it’s you, Tsumugi-kun.</p><p>…It’s been a while. I’m glad; you seem well.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “That’s <em>my</em> line! I am so glad to see in you good health~ Nagisa-kun♪</p><p>What are you doing here? Don’t tell me you’re coming back to Yumenosaki because you’ve had enough with Shuuetsu?</p><p>As if, huh? Adam – no, Eden seem to be really thriving…</p><p>I’m getting a little anxious honestly, since it feels like being left behind by old teammates.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I wonder? I don’t know about social reputation, and I don’t really care.</p><p>…Rather than that, I have business with the student council, you see.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ah, so you’re lost like always?</p><p>That’s not good at all~ You need to learn your way around your own daily needs! You can’t leave it all to other people – it’s them who’ll have a hard time being around you!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Yes. I know, but I can’t bring myself to care.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. You haven’t changed, Nagisa-kun~ I guess that’s fine; if you’ll have me, I can show you until the student council office. Let’s go, it’s this way~♪”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Thank you. You haven’t changed either, Tsumugi-kun; ever so kind.</p><p>…That’s how it is, so… Sorry, I’ll have Tsumugi-kun take me to the council room.</p><p>…You can go, Anzu-san. I’m sorry for taking your time.</p><p>…See you again – perhaps? At a different place, if we do have ties.”</p><p><strong>&gt; Student Council Room</strong></p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Excuse me~”</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/X8UyHkF.jpg"></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Nn?—Huh! Tsumugi… W-What’s the matter? Do you need something from the student council?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “What’s with the suspicious behavior, Eichi-kun? I don’t need anything, but I found Nagisa-kun in the school grounds so I showed him the way!”</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/EJSXHod.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Nagisa-kun? Nagisa-kun is here? Uwaah, what a fine weather…☆”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Huh, Hiyori-kun!? Why are you here!? Are you guys holding an ex-<em>fine</em> reunion party or something?</p><p>I-I wasn’t told about this…!”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “No no, it’s pure coincidence. I think. At the very least, I didn’t plan this… What sort of trick of fate is this, in fact?</p><p>Well, no matter. Nagisa-kun, don’t stand around; come on in.</p><p>I just prepared some tea, so perhaps we can rekindle old friendships while taking a few sips? Let’s have a fun chat over tea about the good old times.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Eeh~? That sounds like it’ll get dark, so no thank you!</p><p>Let’s talk about brighter things, things that have more love! Like my secretly raising this little puppy Jun-kun picked up the other day!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Pets are allowed in your dorm, Hiyori-kun?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Well, no, actually? But that little puppy is just sooo cute!</p><p>Since it was so pitifully frail, it didn’t feel quite right to kick it out, so I’ve been raising it in secret, doing everything to hide it from the dorm mother!</p><p>Look, I took so many pictures! The name is Bloody Mary…☆”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Breaking rules is no good. I think. Not that I can talk down to others about that.</p><p>…This is why you’re stuck in Reimei forever.</p><p>…I want you care for the rules more to allow proper evaluation, so you can join me in Shuuetsu, Hiyori-kun.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Well, putting me aside, Jun-kun doesn’t fulfill the requirements yet, you see?</p><p>Until he’s ready for it, I shall deign to look after him from close!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Who’s more important, me or Jun?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “A difficult question, since you’re both equally important to me! Well, at least we’re together when we work as Eden―so bear with a little loneliness, okay?♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. You two are still so close.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Like the lifelong partners we are, of course! On the other hand, I see things between Eichi-kun and Tsumugi-kun have grown strained? You two won’t even meet eyes since a while ago! A foul weather…!”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “You’re touching a sore spot there. Well, we haven’t spoken like this in a while, so there’s no helping a little awkwardness here and there… right, Tsumugi?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Yes, well, I suppose? Rather than that, can we hear the reason you’re here, Hiyori-kun, Nagisa-kun?</p><p>It’s been bothering me ― this isn’t another of your strange schemes, is it… Eichi-kun?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “So little faith in me. No, apparently Hiyori-kun just came over because he happened to be nearby.</p><p>I was surprised by the sudden visit too. I wish you would say a word or two beforehand.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Why, it’s because I came up with the idea on pure whim! I happened to hear that Trickstar is doing a live in the academy today!</p><p>So I came to see how much they’ve grown since summer.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…That’s right, Trickstar. I’m here to see their live show, too.</p><p>…Since we’ll have work together soon, I want to see for myself how much worth they have.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ahh, I believe their worth would be hard to grasp at a single glance, though! Those children have quite the potential to look forward to―they’ve turned into a favorite of mine♪”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Yes. I’m curious because you said such good things about them, Hiyori-kun.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. Then, since all of us are gathered, why don’t we go see them together? I’ll book us some VIP seats.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Uhh, excuse me, don’t tell me I’m included?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Of course. The key people of <em>fine</em> who once reformed Yumenosaki, all gathering to watch the protagonists of the current era…</p><p>What a tasteful picture, don’t you think?</p><p>Even the thought is tying my stomach in knots, and perhaps Trickstar, being the ones on stage, will be even more bothered…</p><p>But well, why don’t we put some pressure on them as their predecessors?”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I’m good at oozing pressure. Or rather, I’m practicing it because Ibara told me to.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ahaha☆ You’re giving your all for something indecipherable yet again, Nagisa-kun!</p><p>But the way you properly absorb it when others would feel lost is where you’re a rare gem!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I don’t dislike putting in effort or learning. Probing an uncharted domain for a path forward is fun.</p><p>…I think it’ll be nice if I can spend forever doing that.</p><p>…It was no longer possible to do in <em>fine</em>, so I resigned.</p><p>…Because my conquest of the small world by the name of Yumenosaki Academy ended, and there was nothing left to discover.</p><p>…After judging so, I decided to put an end to it, but—</p><p>…It seems a fun story has started once more in this place of learning where dreams bloom.”</p></div><footer class="post-footer"><div class="post-tags"><a href="/tags/Akira/" rel="tag"># Akira</a> <a href="/tags/ES-Substory/" rel="tag"># ES-Substory</a> <a href="/tags/ES-Fall/" rel="tag"># ES-Fall</a></div><div class="post-nav"><div class="post-nav-item"><a href="/2018/scout-substory-rei-3s/" rel="prev" title="★1801SUB | Kaoru, Hinata Substories (Rei set's 3★s)"><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i> ★1801SUB | Kaoru, Hinata Substories (Rei set's 3★s)</a></div><div class="post-nav-item"><a href="/2018/scout-substory-shinobu-3s/" rel="next" title="★1804SUB | Sora Substory (Shinobu set's 3★)">★1804SUB | Sora Substory (Shinobu set's 3★) <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></footer></article></div></div></div><div class="toggle sidebar-toggle"><span class="toggle-line toggle-line-first"></span> <span class="toggle-line toggle-line-middle"></span> <span class="toggle-line toggle-line-last"></span></div><aside class="sidebar"><div class="sidebar-inner"><ul class="sidebar-nav motion-element"><li class="sidebar-nav-toc">Table of Contents</li><li class="sidebar-nav-overview">Overview</li></ul><div class="post-toc-wrap sidebar-panel"><div class="post-toc motion-element"><ol class="nav"><li class="nav-item nav-level-2"><a class="nav-link" href="#first-substory"><span class="nav-text">First Substory</span></a></li><li class="nav-item nav-level-2"><a class="nav-link" href="#the-fruit-of-knowledge"><span class="nav-text">The Fruit of Knowledge</span></a></li><li class="nav-item nav-level-2"><a class="nav-link" href="#former-kings"><span class="nav-text">Former Kings</span></a></li></ol></div></div><div class="site-overview-wrap sidebar-panel"><div class="site-author motion-element" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><img class="site-author-image" itemprop="image" alt="kotofucius" src="https://image.ibb.co/cPxHhz/kotoava6.gif"><p class="site-author-name" itemprop="name">kotofucius</p><div class="site-description" itemprop="description"></div></div><div class="site-state-wrap motion-element"><nav class="site-state"><div class="site-state-item site-state-posts"><a href="/archives/"><span class="site-state-item-count">34</span> <span class="site-state-item-name">posts</span></a></div><div class="site-state-item site-state-categories"><a href="/categories/"><span class="site-state-item-count">104</span> <span class="site-state-item-name">categories</span></a></div><div class="site-state-item site-state-tags"><a href="/tags/"><span class="site-state-item-count">26</span> <span class="site-state-item-name">tags</span></a></div></nav></div><div class="links-of-author motion-element"><span class="links-of-author-item"><a href="https://twitter.com/kotofucius" title="Twitter → https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kotofucius" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-twitter"></i>Twitter</a></span></div></div><div class="back-to-top motion-element"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i> <span>0%</span></div></div></aside><div id="sidebar-dimmer"></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-inner"><div class="copyright">&copy;
