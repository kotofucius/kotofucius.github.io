If we rile up the teachers or the student council again, our club might get dissolved this time.</p><p>Aah, this is frustrating.</p><p>Releasing some dull announcements regarding school events? That’s not our job.</p><p>This kind of business communication… Well-behaved puff papers? Leave them to the Broadcasting Club instead, can’t you?</p><p>Aargh, what a pain!</p><p>We in the Newspaper Club are made for more… <em>passionate</em> stuffs!</p><p>We release boiling hot news that should pierce through the readers’ hearts and gouge on old wounds!</p><p>That’s our mission in the Newspaper Club!</p><p>But it’s been really peaceful lately, I guess. Nothing bombastic or sensational to write about, even if we want to.</p><p>Can’t some great case occur somewhere? I know it’s inappropriate for a journalist to go wishing for incidents just to write articles, but still.</p><p>I wish that transfer student could’ve caused more chaos. I had hopes for him.</p><p>I mean, it’s an unreal situation where a lone guy’s been thrown into a space full of girls.</p><p>And yet he acts all cool, not causing any stir… Talk about disappointment, that transfer student!</p><p>The other girls are all weird, too. How can you accept him so easily?</p><p>Soooo boring. Isn’t there some great scoop lying around somewhere?)</p><p><strong>Kasumi</strong>: “…”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “…!?”</p><p>(…Eh? What’s that? I was wondering why there are so many birds and animals flocking there, and…!</p><p>Eeh, what’s up with that? I smell a scoop!</p><p>There’s a girl being swarmed by birds and dogs and cats! It’s getting like one of those sky burials!?</p><p>Who’s she again… I feel like I’ve seen her somewhere? Hmm?</p><p>Wait, is this the time to space out!? That girl, she’s alive, right? She’s not dead, right?</p><p>If she’s dead, that makes a case! A huge scoop!</p><p>Even if she’s alive, well, just having so many animals flock on her is already a bizarre phenomenon on its own!</p><p>We can still write about her! Hiyono seems to be into that sort of occult stuffs, anyway!</p><p>Even if I don’t! But beggars can’t be choosers!

Apologies for surprising you.</p><p>But still, I’d appreciate if you don’t stand around there. You’re blocking the sunlight, and I can’t read my book.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Aah… It’s getting dark already, so you’ll just hurt your eyes reading outside.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Oh my, I didn’t notice. The sun is setting, I see. I got a little too immersed…</p><p>Midori-kun, what could you be doing in the courtyard?</p><p>Me, I arrived at this place in my sought for a quiet reading environment.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Aah, I was distributing the latest papers.

Look at that over there! <em>That</em>!”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “My, this is a rare sight. It must’ve been a while since I last saw her face.</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “What, you know her?”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “I know most things there are about Kimisaki Academy. I’ve had a little entanglement with her…</p><p>Her name is Mikage Kasumi. She’s the President of the Cooking Research Club.</p><p>Perhaps you’ll get an idea if I say she’s ‘The Fiend of the Cooking Club’?</p><p>She’s an interesting woman, who once belonged to the student council and trifled with the Troublemakers.</p><p>She seems to have completely retired her post though, and now people call her ‘The Hermit of the Cooking Club’.</p><p>I advise you not to get involved with her, Midori-kun.

Hmm, a Cooking Contest?</p><p>I think quite a few young girls have joined the Cooking Club,</p><p>So perhaps I can randomly pick some of them to send to participate in this contest~…?</p><p>It’ll be a good chance to see what the new girls are capable of.</p><p>Perhaps they’ll even create cooking beyond their capabilities, by being pitted against competitors~</p><p>And it seems I can eat all sorts of dishes with this~ Right, right.

Cheer up!</p><p>You may cry into my chest! ‘Cheer up,’ that is the motto that makes the world go ‘round!”</p><p><strong>Hibiki:</strong> “Ooph! Hey, you two, don’t talk while you’re eating.</p><p>You’re spilling your food on me! I’m wearing a swimsuit so I can just wash it away, but still.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Hibiki-chan, can I ask why you’re wearing a swimsuit, maaybe?</p><p>Gosh, you’re being meaninglessly sexy you’re making my heart race!”</p><p><strong>Hibiki:</strong> “Well… There’s this energetic first year who joined our Swim Club recently…</p><p>It’s troubling how she always comes challenging me into a match during lunch breaks.</p><p>Anyway, I managed to beat her up in the match, but there’s no time to change back to my uniform.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Quiet down, you Weirdo Class! Listen to me! Bring Midori Fumi to me!”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “If it’s Midori-kun you’re looking for, she escaped from the window the moment she heard your footsteps approaching.</p><p>Fufufu, she’s always been good at one thing and that’s being quick on her feet to escape, even in the past…</p><p>Rather than that, can someone wake Kannazuki-kun up for me?</p><p>She’s sleeping on the book I’ve been reading. I’m really curious about the continuation of the story.”</p><p><strong>Hotori:</strong> “Zzz… Zzz…”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Actually, are you Library Committee Duo not going to eat lunch, maaybe? The break will be over before you know it!”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Aah, now that you’ve mentioned it. When I get too focused in reading, I tend to forget my hunger.</p><p>Wake up, Kannazuki-kun. You should take your meals too, once in a while, or you’ll get out of shape.”</p><p><strong>Hotori:</strong> “Hnngaah, my need for sleep is stronger than my need for food~…”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Umm. No one seems to be up for listening to you, so I’ll represent the rest and ask: what’s wrong?</p><p>I can listen to you, if you’re fine with me, student council president.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Urgh. You’re the only sane one in 3-C, Jime-jime. But can you call me Hii-chan instead of Student Council President?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ah, right. I’m sorry, I’m not used to nicknames.</p><p>Fufu. You’re Hii-chan and I’m Jime-jime~…”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Himari-chan, want a pudding?</p><p>Hibiki-chan gave me a large quantity of pudding the other day, and I’ve gotten a little addicted since then!”</p><p><strong>Hibiki:</strong> “Aah, back during the Club Destroyer mess…</p><p>Feed me a spoonful too, I’m tired from all the swimming.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Sure thing! Okay, open your mouth~”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Yakumo-san, is that homemade? How admirable. You can make sweets, huh?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Yeah, Mitsuru-chan said she loves making sweets, so I thought I’ll try having the same hobby, maaybe…</p><p>And I’ve been working hard on that! A show of my maiden heart, if you will!”</p><p><strong>Mashiro:</strong> “Kodama-san, you make your lunches on your own too, don’t you?</p><p>That’s admirable of you! You’re so feminine, all of you. Unlike me, who can’t even cook or clean or do laundry!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “It’s because I have to make it every day, so I just learned the how-to somewhere along the way.</p><p>I make my little sister’s share too, but it’s getting a little bit of a bad rating from her for ‘tasting dry, like health food’~…”</p><p><strong>Mashiro:</strong> “But health is important!

I’ve let my guard down because she’s been quiet lately!”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Aah, I understand now. I read that paper.</p><p>What you want to protest, is the part about the Cooking Contest money prize, right?”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Yeah. The Cooking Contest rewards money to the victor, but it’s just a humble school event to the end…</p><p>The prize is supposed to be a gift certificate worth a thousand yen, just something of that sort.</p><p>And yet, on the paper distributed yesterday…</p><p>They’ve listed the ridiculous sum of <em>ten million yen</em> as the prize money!”</p><hr><h3 id="shocking-part-2"><strong>Shocking, part 2</strong></h3><p><a href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/1f6c299719c994b8d8f1f80fca18adb9/tumblr_inline_oepywaZBxB1rr3xef_540.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="image" data-src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/1f6c299719c994b8d8f1f80fca18adb9/tumblr_inline_oepywaZBxB1rr3xef_540.jpg"></a></p><p><strong>Mashiro:</strong> “The reward for the victor of the Cooking Contest is… ten million yen!?</p><p>Eeh, that’s too many zeros for me to comprehend!</p><p>How much is ten million yen in Japanese yen!?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “I think it’ll still be ten million yen, Hitaki-san.</p><p>Anyway. While Enjouji-san may be capable, preparing such large sum of money is impossible for you, right, Hii-chan?”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Yes. I, the student co~ncil prez, am just one of the common people. At worst case, I can borrow it from Reika…</p><p>But I’m still a high school girl! I don’t want to be in such huge debt! That’s why I’m in trouble, what should I do!?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Aww, poor you… There, there. Good girl.</p><p>Please don’t cry, Hii-chan. I’ll always be on your side~…”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Jime-jime~…”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Excuse me for the interruption, but I think it’s still an abnormal sum.</p><p>So I don’t believe anyone took the article for granted. Normally, they’ll be able to tell it’s a misprint, or a typo, won’t they?</p><p>And it’s coming from that Midori-kun, of the Newspaper Club. They have low reliability rates; though things might be different if this had been during my era.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Your era…? Well, I suppose you’re right.</p><p>The students’ trust level for the Newspaper Club is pretty much zero, for all the shams they wrote during the Student Council President Reelection.</p><p>And they’ve been producing bland articles lately.</p><p>I <em>do</em> review them for censorship first, but I haven’t been able to read to the smallest details in my tight schedule!</p><p>I don’t like reading!”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Weren’t you supposed to be part of the Literature Club, Tsurumi-kun?”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Yes, well… Anyway, that Midori Fumi’s up to no good again, isn’t she?</p><p>I was thinking to interrogate her, but she ran away!</p><p>Running away from me means she must’ve something bad to hide!</p><p>It’s all Midori Fumi’s fault! She’s the one behind the curtains! It’s always like that!”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Hmm… As a friend of Midori-kun, I’d like to say in her defense: she may be prone to be misunderstood, but she’s not a villain at her roots.</p><p>I think she’s exceedingly sorry for what she’s done during the Student Council President Reelection.</p><p>I don’t believe she’ll repeat the same foolish mistake twice.</p><p>But still, Cooking Contest, huh? I admit I’m curious of that Fiend’s movements I’ve been catching.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Fiend? Ugh, anyway!</p><p>I can’t exactly proclaim that the article was a fake this late!</p><p>Midori Fumi already spread the papers so needlessly efficiently throughout the whole school!</p><p>It will be soon known to everyone that the prize money for the Cooking Contest is tremendous!</p><p>It’s going to be a hot topic throughout the school!</p><p>I <em>am</em> grateful to have everyone excited for the event, so I don’t want to pour water on their fun.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “I can see. With that Student Council President Reelection settled,</p><p>You’re just finally starting to perform genuinely as the Student Council President, Hii-chan.</p><p>I’m sure you won’t want to stumble on the first step.</p><p>But, hmm… The student council had been under Enjouji-san’s reign for so long…</p><p>If it’s Enjouji-san, she most definitely can give out ten million yen pretty easily.</p><p>Won’t the people who had gotten used to Enjouji-san’s era end up believing in it?</p><p>Even if a high school student were to get their hands on that much money, I don’t believe they’ll have anything to use it for, though.”</p><hr><h3 id="shocking-part-3"><strong>Shocking, part 3</strong></h3><p><a href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/15c86cadb2fd44779a8134ccf50946a8/tumblr_inline_oepyz0wwqF1rr3xef_540.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="image" data-src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/15c86cadb2fd44779a8134ccf50946a8/tumblr_inline_oepyz0wwqF1rr3xef_540.jpg"></a></p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Hey, you heard that?

Ten million yen.</p><p>Maybe to say they’ve been blinded by money is a rude way of putting it, but the Cooking Contest is indeed heating up.</p><p>The problem is that the student council doesn’t have the capability to reward such money.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Yeah… I don’t know about Reika’s reign, but the present student council doesn’t have such money!</p><p>Money, as in the student council budget, should be used for better things too!</p><p>That’s why, <em>please</em>!

Ehehe, that’s a load off my shoulders~…</p><p>But is it really okay, Jime-jime? You’re not fond of people depending on you, right?</p><p>Until recently, you’ve been revered as the Living God, and people depended on you for all sorts of stuffs…</p><p>Having to shoulder all their burdens, you’ve had a hard time, right?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “No, I love having people depend on me and making them happy.</p><p>I just ended up with a little more burden than I could handle… so I was troubled.</p><p>But wanting to be of help for a friend is a normal feeling for an ordinary girl to have, right?</p><p>I’m not a god.

We may be in the same club, but we’re not friends.</p><p>…Well, I guess we’ve been sticking a little too much to each other, lately. But in the end, we were born alone and will die alone.</p><p>We’re different people, so our paths will always be parallel to each other, never crossing. Yun, yun.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Aargh, jeez, I have no idea what you’re saying! My head hurts whenever I talk with you!”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “And I feel the same with you. Your voice is so loud, it’s unpleasant.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “…Hmm? What’s wrong, Geboku-kun? Do you have something to say to the Electrowave Girl?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Aah, wait, you were here? You really have no presence, do you…?”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Oh, is she a friend of yours? It hasn’t been a while since you transferred, and you already know so many people! Great job!”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Yun, yun.</p><p>I really can’t refuse you… Okay then, I’ll tell you.</p><p>The twins are probably over there… at the field beyond the school gate. I can hear their voices from there.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Really? How can you tell? Actually, what could the twins be up to in such place…?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Don’t ask me.

Hmm… I seriously don’t get her, as always!</p><p>But you communicated pretty well with her, huh, Geboku-kun? When she’s such an incomprehensible electrowave girl…</p><p>That’s amazing, you know?</p><p>The student co~ncil prez is impressed! Good boy, good boy!</p><p>…If you’re close with her, I’d like you to be kind to her.</p><p>She always seems so glum; I’m actually a bit worried for her.</p><p>We have a pretty perilous relationship due to stuffs, but she’s still a student of Kimisaki Academy.</p><p>I wish her to celebrate her youth in happiness.</p><p>I can’t be the one to give it to her, but if you can present her happiness and smile in my place…</p><p>I’ll be so proud of you!</p><p>Okaaay, let’s walk while holding hands!

I’m the same, Onee-chan!</p><p>My world is complete with just ‘Onee-chan’ and ‘myself’!</p><p>But I’ll gather the ingredients at least… You’re a better cook than me, Onee-chan.</p><p>If we’re going to split the roles, isn’t it better to have you on the kitchen?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “I won’t force you to do what you don’t want, Ichika.</p><p>But if possible, I hope you’ll let me go with this plan.

Why do you always take things so slow?</p><p>But whatever. Now our plans are in order!</p><p>Fufufu!</p><p>No one definitely notices that my partner in the Occult Club Representative Team is actually the Cooking Club President, Mikage Kasumi!</p><p>Even in the participation form,</p><p>I wrote down Futaba Mizuki and her Mysterious Partner as the Occult Club Representative Team!</p><p>And the approving of the forms was my job as the student council secretary.</p><p>So I can push the stamp on such a suspicious document with an innocent look.</p><p>Even if there’s someone else in the student council checking the documents…</p><p>They’ll probably think my Mysterious Partner is Mina-chan or Tokikuni from the same club.</p><p>But what do you know, the true form of that Mysterious Partner is actually… The Fiend of the Cooking Club, Mikage Kasumi!</p><p>I got a little worked up when Kasumi was chosen as an examiner…</p><p>Since examiners can’t participate in the Cooking Contest, yeah?</p><p>But if we use that Evil Spirit costume to cover her face…</p><p>No one can guess her true identity, unless it’s someone with incredible intuition!</p><p>While no one notices her, I’ll have Kasumi complete our dish!</p><p>Once the dish is done, we secretly have Tokikuni or another person change into the Evil Spirit costume to replace her…</p><p>And our strategy will be perfect! I’m such a genius I scare myself sometimes! Fufufu!</p><p>Well, we’re acting against the rules, though…</p><p>They’ll fail us if we get discovered, so hide yourself well, Kasumi.</p><p>But it’s not like we’re troubling anyone so much for this, so it should be fine, right?</p><p>We’ll win and get the money prize of ten million yen. Well, we’re not so greedy we’re asking for the whole sum, you know?</p><p>If the enemy had such an outrageous demand made to them firsthand, and then we compromise, lowering the hurdle a bit…</p><p>They won’t be able to refuse the next offer. That’s the basics of negotiation!</p><p>Anyway, we’ll excuse ourselves from the money prize of ten million yen.</p><p>In return, we’ll ask them to give proper budget to the Occult Research Society.</p><p>Our budget keeps getting lowered, apparently because it’s suspicious or something.</p><p>We just want the average budget. And this Cooking Contest is a stepping stone to make that negotiation.</p><p>I don’t plan to overthrow the studco or anything, anyway.</p><p>And… you’re the same, aren’t you… Kasumi?”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “Oh my~…”</p><p><strong>Mizuki:</strong> “But really, how the heck did you mess with the article?</p><p>You’re such a fearsome one… The student council president was so worked up, you know?</p><p>Kinda tugged my heartstrings a bit. I didn’t tell you to go so far, did I?</p><p>You probably have no idea, but that idiot is giving her all to succeed Enjouji.</p><p>She’s making Kimisaki Academy a slightly more fun place than it was in the past.</p><p>I actually have her back, kind of. She and I are in the same student council, after all.</p><p>She’ll act smug if I tell her, though, so I won’t… Hey, are you listening?”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Mizuki:</strong> “Well, whatever. Rather than that, go do the cooking. Just do the finishing touch.</p><p>I cooked it while glaring at the recipe book, but I couldn’t do it well…</p><p>Do you think this would work? I made stew and hamburg steak…</p><p>Mina-chan and Tokikuni were the ones who gathered the ingredients, by the way.</p><p>There’s no rule that stops us from having unrelated cooperators.</p><p>Tokikuni’s good at searching things. She promptly gathered up the ingredients and handed them to me quite early.</p><p>I got so many ingredients, it was tiring just to carry them all the way to the Home Ec room.</p><p>I turned them into a dish somehow, but…</p><p>I don’t know what I’m supposed to do after this. This is the limit of my abilities now.</p><p>I just need you to make this into something yummy. You can cook from one if you want, but…</p><p>Well, just with a touch from you, we can secure our victory!”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Mizuki:</strong> “Ah, where are you going?!

That’s the sort of girl she is. She does have a reason.</p><p>Just like how someone with a perfect pitch feels like vomiting when they hear a discordant sound…</p><p>Mikage-san has an abnormal, almost sickly sense of taste, that’s preventing her from eating most food.</p><p>For her, who was born with a sense of taste so abnormal it goes beyond reason…</p><p>Just by eating food that doesn’t taste good, she’ll feel like vomiting, or get an attack of vertigo. She might even faint.</p><p>Her brain can’t take it. She kind of gets an eating disorder from that. When I first met her, she was so underweight—</p><p>As if she was only skin and bones. No; she was like a moving skeleton.</p><p>One’s sense of taste isn’t just defined by the tongue, but also the esophagus, and other senses comprised by the cells…</p><p>So even her stomach and everything else are especially sensitive, that her body absolutely can’t accept food that doesn’t taste good.</p><p>Her flesh can’t absorb any nutrient from food that isn’t delicious.</p><p>Even if she gets an IV vitamin infusion, her body won’t accept it and push it out, so it’s a really grave illness.</p><p>It’s like how we can’t eat stones or metals…</p><p>How even if we force ourselves to eat them, our bodies won’t be able to absorb them.</p><p>For her, most foods are filths she can’t put in her mouth.</p><p>But people can’t live on without eating. That’s why Mikage-san is always adjoined with death.</p><p>The reason she always takes things slowly is also mostly because she doesn’t have enough calories.</p><p>Because she can’t absorb food, her body at least pins down the dissipation of her energy by executing every action slowly.</p><p>Even so, she holds her grounds with the will to live.</p><p>Searching for a food, for a delicious food even <em>she</em> can eat.</p><p>That’s why she’s the president of the Cooking Club.</p><p>She’s always so desperately, struggling to death… searching for a delicious dish, day and night.</p><p>For her, ‘to live’ truly means ‘to eat’.</p><p>Mikage-san.</p><p>Would you eat the food I… the food my sister and I made?”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “I can’t save you.

Don’t touch our cooking, please.</p><p>If you’ll touch it, do it only when you’re eating it. Don’t go changing the taste, please.</p><p>Koharu-chan, Prez. Don’t give up on this dish so easily.</p><p>We made this with all we had. I know, even if we packed our feelings, our love into it, that doesn’t change how a food tastes.</p><p>But there were people who became great musicians even though their ears couldn’t hear.</p><p>I covered for what Koharu-chan lacked. And what I didn’t have, Koharu-chan filled in my place.</p><p>That was how we made this dish.</p><p>Please eat it. I know you won’t regret it.”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “…</p><p>…Bon appetit.”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Yes, please eat to your fill.”</p><hr><h3 id="epilogue-2"><strong>Epilogue 2</strong></h3><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “Munch, munch.</p><p>…Oh my? Oh my, oh my?</p><p>I wonder why… this is a taste I miss. It feels like I have eaten this, a long time ago?”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Of course you have. Koharu-chan has always been helping you cook, hasn’t she, Prez?</p><p>Your techniques, the way you cook, have all soaked into Koharu-chan’s bones.</p><p>This is your flavor.</p><p>Your flavor that Koharu-chan loves… Your flavor that exists within her.</p><p>I was the one who decided what to make.</p><p>So I wanted to at least make the flavor match her ideals.</p><p>I’ve only just met Koharu-chan…</p><p>So I don’t know anything about her, but I want to be her friend. I want us to understand each other. We’ve become partners like it’s all fate, after all.</p><p>I’ve always been so passive. I only ever listen to what people tell me…</p><p>I’ve lived so far cautious of how people felt, what they thought, and what expression they had.</p><p>Even if just a little, I want to put my sad way of living into use.</p><p>I want to at least guide Koharu-chan to cook the flavor of her dreams.</p><p>If I can’t, that’s just too lonely. You can cook alone, but it’s happier to do it together.</p><p>I wanted to at least put our feelings into one as we cooked.</p><p>Believing we’d understand each other, we moved our hands. We made this with all we had.</p><p>I’ll say this as many times as you want. This is our dish that we wanted you to eat, Prez.</p><p>How did it taste?”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “…</p><p>You can try it yourself, you know~…?</p><p>You’re feeding it to someone else, so you should’ve test-tasted it, at least…”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Eh, it wasn’t good? Excuse me for a bit… munch, munch.</p><p>Mguh!? Ugh, this… the flavor’s all messed up…</p><p>We made it in hurry so the flavor is thin, and it doesn’t have a good texture too…</p><p>I-It’s not inedible, but…</p><p>U-Uugh! I’m so embarrassed! And I was telling you off so smugly…</p><p>I’m not good enough. I’m still so terrible at this. I’m inexperienced as a cook…”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “No.</p><p>You shouldn’t have to imitate ‘this part’ too, you know~…?”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “What?”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “In the past, I once ended up unable to eat anything…</p><p>So I ventured, in search of a dish, a flavor I could eat.</p><p>I traveled through the whole world. There’s someone rich that I know, so I had them support me financially.</p><p>In sought for an unknown flavor, I pushed my way through a jungle…</p><p>Where I met a girl like a wild ape, who had never even licked a spice before.</p><p>At that time, I was such a terrible cook…</p><p>After all, my arms were as thin as bones, I couldn’t even lift up a pot. Just cooking for a few minutes made me out of breath.</p><p>But that girl waited for me, with sparkling eyes.</p><p>She helped me. She ate the food I made, praising how delicious it was.</p><p>You made me recall that, a bit…</p><p>Memories and feelings, they aren’t necessary in making delicious food.</p><p>They’re not… supposed to affect how the food fundamentally tastes.</p><p><a href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/fde33c10e69e4b530acbde6ff5b792f4/tumblr_inline_oet91rkbLC1rr3xef_540.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="image" data-src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/fde33c10e69e4b530acbde6ff5b792f4/tumblr_inline_oet91rkbLC1rr3xef_540.jpg"></a></p><p>How strange… Why am I crying…?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Your Highness.”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “I’m sorry, ‘Koharu-chan’. It was my fault that you lost your sense of taste.</p><p>I studied cuisine, started making more and more delicious dishes… and I kept feeding them to you.</p><p>I was so happy because you’d look so delighted…</p><p>But your sense of taste couldn’t stand my cooking, that was getting more and more extreme in taste and far-reachingly delicious…</p><p>I broke you.</p><p>Sooner or later, you’d turn just like me…</p><p>You wouldn’t be able to eat any kind of food with a smile. Worse yet, you won’t be able to accept them, and just vomit everything.</p><p>Unable to eat anything, you’ll starve, dry up and die.</p><p>I wanted to part from you before that happens. Why did you have to chase after me, you foolish girl…</p><p>You were my first customer ever, that I met deep in the jungle.”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Your Highness…?”</p><hr><h3 id="epilogue-3"><strong>Epilogue 3</strong></h3><p><a href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/5dbfff78810ffd2c068b69474be62870/tumblr_inline_oet957PXDt1rr3xef_540.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="image" data-src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/5dbfff78810ffd2c068b69474be62870/tumblr_inline_oet957PXDt1rr3xef_540.jpg"></a></p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “Thank you for the food. Aah, I couldn’t even eat most of it, and I feel so full, somehow. Thank you, both of you.</p><p>But I can’t give this dish a score.</p><p>It’s mostly a failed dish. If we gather up all the examiners’ scores…</p><p>Miss Shrine Maiden would be the winner, I suppose.</p><p>We the Cooking Club can’t obtain the money prize of ten million yen.</p><p>Well, I suppose that doesn’t matter. Giving up on everything like in the past…</p><p>Relying on the power of money, and seeking for a gourmet delicacy in the wide world… I don’t need to do all of that anymore.</p><p>It seems like you two… will be able to present me a delicious food in the near future.</p><p>Kukuku! <em>Cooking</em>! I’m expecting a lot from you, Chiyo-ya-san, Koharu-ya-san!</p><p>Satisfy me, the most selfish and picky customer in the entire world, okay?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “G-Gau! I don’t really get it, but I’ll work hard!</p><p>Because I want you to keep smiling, Your Highness!
