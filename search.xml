Indeterminate plans to continue.</p></div><a id="more"></a><h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2><p><strong>Location: Classroom</strong></p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Alright everyone, can we have a bit of your attention?</p><p>Keep your chatting down, yeah freshmen?</p><p>I know you’re excited about your new school and new classmates, but let me do my job, won’t you?</p><p>Yep, good kids. Okay then, I’ll start my explanation.”</p><p><strong>Yae:</strong> “Yogiri-senpai~ Shouldn’t you start with introducing yourself?”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Right. Bet there are some who are curious as to why you’re wearing a costume, too.</p><p>…Anyway, this is relatively unimportant, but call me ‘Captain’ instead of ‘Yogiri-senpai’, ‘kay?</p><p>I don’t really give a shit, but everyone else won’t shut up about it…</p><p>I said I’ll pass because it’s too much trouble, but they end up making me the Softball Club captain <em>and</em> Athletics Committee chairman, y’know?</p><p>If that’s how it’s gonna play anyway, I wish I’d become a student council member instead.</p><p>I mean, I’m gonna be busy either way… so I want some comfort or like, <em>love</em>, you know?</p><p>If I were part of the stuco, I can be with Hiyono anytime.</p><p>Hiyono, Hiyono, I wanna see you. Hiyono~ Why have we been placed in different classes~…?”</p><p><strong>Yae:</strong> “Urgh, you’re <em>unbearable</em>… Please take things more seriously. Look at me, I’m helping you despite the troubles, aren’t I?</p><p>Come on! Stop writing ‘Hiyono’ all over the blackboard!</p><p>Can you spare us your strange act? You’re grossing out the new kids…</p><p>Geez, you’ve completely regressed into a useless human being since becoming a third year, huh?”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “(<em>sniff</em>) Oh, shut up. You’re cheeky for a tiny mascot.</p><p>You’re so cute, damnit. You’ve become a second year, but you haven’t seemed to grow even an inch taller, huh?”</p><p><strong>Yae:</strong> “I’ll be entering my growth period from now!</p><p>…Well, my parents and older brother are practically dwarves so I guess I shouldn’t be too hopeful.</p><p>But I’ll drink lots of milk and become big! Gulp, gulp~”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Still moving to your own tune like ever, huh Nagamachi?</p><p>Well, we just welcomed a new school year… I guess human beings can’t change so suddenly.</p><p>Whatever. Softball Club aside, as part of the Athletics Committee I should be encountering the studco often.</p><p>So I’ll finish up my job as smoothly as always this time.</p><p>And so—let’s begin the self-introductions!</p><p>I’m the Athletics Committee Chairman, Yogiri Hayate. I’m the Hero of Justice that protects the peace of Kimisaki Academy~”</p><p><strong>Yae:</strong> “Just ignore the last bit~ And I act as the chairman’s assistant; the name’s Nagamachi Yae!”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Well, I don’t think it’ll be for very long, but let’s get along.</p><p>Kids, while you’re listening, take a look at the print we just gave you.</p><p>We’re planning for an event called the Freshman Gathering that’ll be held in two weeks.</p><p>To cut to the chase, it’s basically a culture festival just for first-years.</p><p>And for that Gathering…</p><p>The tradition is to choose a few committee chairmen to be placed in each first year class, to support the first years who haven’t gotten used to the Academy yet.</p><p>Until last year, we have two or three committee chairmen assigned to each one class…</p><p>But since Kimisaki Academy becomes coed this year… Seems we’ve gotten quite a large number of freshmen.</p><p>And the number of classes increases, too.</p><p>Frankly speaking, just the number of you first years alone is already double the other grades, y’know?</p><p>And so, because of the lack of hands, there’s just one committee chairman assigned to each class.</p><p>But we’re also given an assistant, and in my case, I have Nagamachi, see?</p><p>I wanted to have Hiyono, though~ But Nagamachi said to leave it to her and forced herself on me~”</p><p><strong>Yae:</strong> “Shut up… That Hiyono person, she’s from a different class and a different club and a different committee from you, right?</p><p>Then she’s a complete stranger. And it seems she’s busy, being a student council officer, right?</p><p>Just be satisfied with having me, Yogiri-senpai~”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Like I said, call me Captain… I guess that doesn’t matter.</p><p>Anyway, basically we’re in charge of this class. Remember our faces, alright~?</p><p>Well, there’s another one—Ichigou<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>… I mean Kodama Ichika — who’s supposed to be helping us out. We’ll introduce her later.</p><p>(<em>whisper</em>) Oi, Nagamachi. Where’s Ichigou? Is she skipping, that little shit?”</p><p><strong>Yae:</strong> “Umm~ Ichika, after her sister graduated… she seems to be trying to look away from the loneliness by practicing her sword skills to death.</p><p>Just leave her to herself for now, Yogiri-senpai.</p><p>I’ll be supporting you with all I have in exchange!”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Really, that’s kinda worrying. She can be so cynical sometimes.</p><p>Well, that aside. It already says so in the paper, but the Freshman Gathering is in two weeks. What you’ll be making has been decided in the committee meeting.</p><p>I think you first years won’t be having much burden, so just take it easy, yeah?</p><p>By the way, in Kimisaki Academy’s Gathering… there’s a tradition of having some animal ears as motif.</p><p>To go straight to the point… the theme this year is bunny ears!</p><p>The year above me—the third years that have graduated, they had bunny ears as motif too.</p><p>And you, the new first years, will be continuing on them.</p><p>But we’re coed this year, and some of you are male, so honestly, I’m not sure what to think, yeah?</p><p>But, well, Nagamachi and I… when we were first years, we were made to wear cat ears and dog ears.</p><p>So to be frank, it’d totally <em>tick me off</em> if you guys alone were to be spared from the embarrassing tradition.</p><p>That’s how traditions are passed, first years!</p><p>But anyway, for you guys, it’ll be your first school event.</p><p>Make lots of friends while you’re at it. Make lots of pleasant memories.</p><p>Get along and liven the racket, the Kimisaki way… Just have as much fun as you want, yeah?”</p><h2 id="new-era">New Era</h2><h3 id="part-1"><strong>Part 1</strong></h3><p><strong>Location: Corridor</strong></p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “~</p><p>Hmm-hmm-hmm~”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “You seem to be in a good mood, Hiyono-chan.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hwee? No, umm, I-I’m sorry. Listening to me humming must’ve been gross, right?</p><p>U-Uugh… I have to stop being this self-abasing!”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Calm down. Isn’t it fine? It’s peaceful…</p><p>It’s hard not to feel giddy at the start of a new semester, but I think I’ve gotten used to life as a third year a bit.</p><p>And to student council work, too. Now that I look back on it, I realize anew how abnormal the previous year was.</p><p>It was so hectic every day, wasn’t it?</p><p>But it seems this year, most of our first years are quiet children…</p><p>Though of course, since until last year, we’ve been mostly an all-girls school, lots of things feel fresh… and rather strange.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Ehehe. Yes, there are boys normally passing by the corridors now.</p><p>I’m still not used to the sight, so whenever I pass by them, I tend to stiffen up a bit~”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “We’ll need to get used to it, though. That’s what Transfer student-kun was for in the first place, wasn’t it?</p><p>Well, that one <em>is</em> a little unique for a boy, I guess…”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Yes~ By the way, since the new first years are all wearing the new uniform design—even putting the boys aside, the girls are also a fresh sight.</p><p>But that makes it easier to tell them from the rest, I suppose.”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Yeah. We old students are still wearing the old uniform, after all.</p><p>Some fashionable students are happy with the new uniform and wear them, though.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “There’s also Mizushima-senpai who repeated a grade—she’s wearing the new uniform, right?</p><p>With the old uniform, we got different colors based on our year batch, after all.</p><p>I assume she feels awkward about wearing a green uniform alone when all her classmates wear blue.”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “In that sense, I guess this decision was timely. Though I think I see that person wear her white school swimsuit more than I see her in uniform.</p><p>We have boys now, so I hope she won’t walk around in her swimsuit too much…”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Fufu. The school rule was lax in the first place, but it’s practically free when it comes to uniform…</p><p>The disciplinary committee has quieted down a lot, too.”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Yeah. I’m starting to think Segawa-senpai was really necessary.</p><p>Because she often scolded Momo-chan for scribbling, I didn’t have such a good impression of her… But having too much freedom isn’t so good either, huh?”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Right~ But still, in the end, <em>this</em> is the Kimisaki uniform for us…</p><p>It’s packed full of memories.”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Ahaha. Last semester, we had a tough time regarding the new uniform…</p><p>So it’s kinda anticlimactic that we end up wearing our old uniforms, isn’t it?”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “But the new first years are all pleased with the new uniform, so I’d say it’s a happy ending.”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Agreed. And it’s Sumire-chan’s design that ended up getting picked, so that goes double.</p><p>Sometimes, I consider wearing the new uniform myself,</p><p>But we only have one year left of high school. Buying a new set of uniform feels like such a waste.</p><p>Then again, I’ve just grown even taller, so I guess I can buy a new set once I outgrow this one…”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hau… You’re still growing…? I’m envious, Natsumi-san.</p><p>You and Tomoko-san both have such nice bodies; I feel left out being the only tiny one, you know?”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “You have your own type of fans, Hiyono-chan. The first year boys seem to be appreciating your cuteness.</p><p>We’re drawing attention and cheering just by walking down the corridor like this, too.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hawawa… It’s like we’ve become idols. Student council officers are amazing…</p><p>I guess they’re the ‘well-known people’ of the school. I didn’t even dream of this until last year…”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “True. But well, we chose this for ourselves…</p><p>We can’t take it back or escape from it. Let’s support each other and march forward, until our graduation day.</p><p>All of us in the student council, together. I’m always on your side, Hiyono-chan.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Yes, Natsumi-san… It’s an honor!</p><p>I’ll be doing my best too.</p><p>First of all, I guess we have the Freshman Gathering coming up soon. Let’s enliven the event and make sure it goes down without a hitch!”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Well, the Gathering centers on the first years and the committees…</p><p>We’re just kinda like their managers. The workload is light on us.</p><p>But it’s our first big event since we’ve become coed; let’s not let our guard down.</p><p>By the way, student council does get included in ‘committees’ so…</p><p>Our leader, Transfer student-kun… well, President-kun, seems to be assigned to a first year class too.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Fufu. Honestly, President is always hard at work.</p><p>He was already really busy last year, but this year, he’ll be even busier, right?</p><p>I’m worried for him. I hope he won’t pass out from exhaustion.”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “No, no, it’s fine! No need to worry about him. He has fun doing that.</p><p>Just leave him to do what he wants.</p><p>Different from your Darling… my Darling is practically helping people for the simple act itself.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hawawa? W-W-Who did you mean by <em>my</em> Darling?</p><p>Umm, you see, I haven’t been able to meet Hayate-san since we’ve been placed in different classes…</p><p>Things have been a little distant and, well… kind of vague between us, you see?</p><p>Of course, she’s always shining passionately in my heart, though~…</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Rather than stick with an imaginary one in your heart, you can just impose on her class. She’s right there at a place where you can meet her whenever you miss her.</p><p>I think she’ll welcome you with wide arms if you do, you know?”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “No, but umm, I think I’ll still be a bother, so…?”</p><p><strong>Natsumi:</strong> “Hmm… Well, most of the student council work often ends up being done by Tomoko-chan.</p><p>So whether President-kun is present or not doesn’t make much difference.</p><p>I guess this is just how this year’s stuco will be: we have the right people at the right places.</p><p>President-kun is helping people left and right, so the student council’s popularity keeps on rising.</p><p>It’s good to have a husband that’s often absent from home~<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Yes. I don’t believe we’ll have anything like the Student Council President Reelection mess breaking out again.</p><p>As a member of the Newspaper Club, part of me is a little lonely at the thought, though.”</p><p>(You know, Prez… no, Fumi-san. I’m having so much fun every day.</p><p>Hmm-hmm-hmm~…)</p><h3 id="part-2">Part 2</h3><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “(<em>sigh</em>)…”</p><p>(Ngaah… I feel melancholic. Not that I know how to spell ‘melancholic’ with kanji. Umm, where did I put my electronic dictionary, again?</p><p>Ah, right. I haven’t been carrying it around lately.</p><p>I usually put it in my pocket for songwriting purposes, but I don’t have the need for it anymore.</p><p>Suzu-senpai and Seira-senpai graduated…</p><p>I was so lonely, so upset at the thought they wouldn’t be there even if I went to the Rock Band Club room… and I never did show up there anymore.</p><p>Because of that, things have been a little strained between me and Shizuku-chan…</p><p>We’re put in different classes again. I don’t see Shizuku-chan unless I show up for club.</p><p>And we’ve been busy since it’s just the start of the new semester.</p><p>Ah, no… those are just excuses I made up to run away from her.</p><p>She’s messaged me so many times, but…</p><p>I don’t know how to reply. It feels like I’ll end up saying something cruel to Shizuku-chan.</p><p>We last met during the seniors’ graduation; I cried and cried and sulked, not wanting to let them go…</p><p>Even though that was something beyond our power.</p><p>Shizuku-chan and I should be continuing on the important thing we’ve received from our seniors. We should be supporting each other…</p><p>But all I ever do is depend on her. All I ever do is whine.</p><p>Shizuku-chan… I’m sure she’s tired of me too.</p><p>Shizuku-chan was there for me.</p><p>She was considerate of my feelings; telling me many times that I’m her friend, that I’m her precious comrade in the Rock Band Club…</p><p>But I shut my ears from all that and ran away.</p><p>After all—I hate this, I hate this, <em>I hate this</em>! I wanna see Suzu-senpai! I wanna hear Seira-senpai’s song!</p><p>But they’ve both graduated!</p><p>I shouldn’t be averting my eyes away from that.</p><p>Suzu-senpai, she tried to forget the pain of losing something precious to her…</p><p>…by acting like a chuuni, like she’s broken—but I can’t be like her.</p><p>I’m a coward… But… I mean, I don’t have anything.</p><p>I have half-baked talents in playing instruments and singing. I have no guts to stand on stage… and even with writing songs or lyrics, I’m…</p><p>I heard some of the new kids who joined are experienced with doing music.</p><p>Suzu-senpai and Seira-senpai have formed a band together, and they seem to have gotten famous.</p><p>Lots of kids who admire them are pushing to enter the Rock Band Club. I get how they feel. That’s just natural.</p><p>After all, I was the same. I admired them too.</p><p>And it’s precisely because we’re the same, that compared to those new kids who can play instruments, sing, write songs and lyrics…</p><p>My uselessness will stand out even more. I’m a good-for-nothing, aren’t I?</p><p>I’m supposed to be their senior… If a load is all I can be, that’s just embarrassing.</p><p>Why didn’t I try harder? I only ever leaned on their kindness, was only ever treated nicely…</p><p>I can’t contribute anything to the club. I’m just a burden.</p><p>It’s better if I just give up on the Rock Band Club, isn’t it?</p><p>I’m sure Shizuku-chan prefers to be with people who have skills. And I’m sure that’s better for her.</p><p>Shizuku-chan… Suzu-senpai, Seira-senpai…</p><p>I wonder if I (<em>boku</em>)… if ‘I’ (<em>watashi</em>) am unneeded, after all?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p><p>……?</p><p>My phone’s buzzing… Maybe it’s Onii-chan.</p><p>For someone so gruff, he can be such a worrywart. He gets angry when I don’t go straight home, too.</p><p>Huh? No, it’s Shizuku-chan. I wonder what’s up? I’ve been ignoring her texts, so…</p><p>She seems to have given up on contacting me lately.</p><p>‘<em>I have something to show you, so come to the clubroom’</em>… Hmm? What is it?</p><p>I don’t really get it, but I guess I’ll go see. To put an end to this.</p><p>I’ll submit my resignation form.</p><p>I’ll drop out of the Rock Band Club, study properly until graduation…</p><p>And chase after Suzu-senpai’s band as a fan, while enjoying my campus life. I’ll live a normal life.)</p><p><strong>Location: Rock Band Clubroom</strong></p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “E-Excuse meee…?”</p><p>(Whoa, what’s with the heat? Are they holding a concert? There’s so much noise. I think I’m going deaf…</p><p>I can barely see in front of me with the crowd. I wouldn’t have imagined something like this from the Rock Band Club last year…</p><p>With the great incoming of new members, the club’s scale has also gotten larger.</p><p>Just the club members alone make for a great number of people, but people who look like fans are gathered too.</p><p>There’s practically no place for me. No… that’s probably how it’s been since the start.</p><p>Suzu-senpai welcomed me, embraced me gently, coddled me…</p><p>She left me by her side, but I need to wake up.</p><p>We were licking each other’s wounds, and it healed me. But I have no right to depend on them anymore.</p><p>Even without me, the Rock Band Club… Shizuku-chan… doesn’t seem to be having any problem, right?)</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> (Huh, that’s Shizuku-chan. What’s up with that strange costume?</p><p>It’s cute, but it has a ‘mad’ feel… Dark fairytale…?</p><p>Is that supposed to be stage costume? That’s rare; she’s singing without playing drums…</p><p>She’s a great singer too. What a beautiful voice.</p><p>I knew that, though. She always accompanied me through my singing practice, after all.</p><p>We went to the karaoke, sung together at the puppet house…</p><p>It was so fun… But, we can’t return to those ‘happy times’ anymore.</p><p>You’re so far away, Shizuku-chan. You’re so bright. I feel so pathetic in front of you.)</p><h3 id="part-3">Part 3</h3><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “Excuse me—I’m sorry! Please let me pass! I have business with Shizuku-chan!</p><p>Mgyu! W-Who? Hey, which of you stepped on my foot just now? Grrrr!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “……Ruka-chan.”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “Shizuku-chan.</p><p>You know, umm, I…</p><p>I’m sorry for not answering to the chat. It’s not because I hate you, or anything.</p><p>You know, I’m… going to d-d-d-d-d-dr…”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “D-d-d… drum, drum, drum~”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “Eh, what? What’s with that step? S-Shizuku-chan has started some strange dance…!?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Ruka-chan… No, <em>Ruka</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>! You, the bearer of the Gospel! My brethren—oh, wingless Lucifer!</p><p>Fuhahahaha! You did well to come! I’ve been waiting for you…”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “Eh? Eeeh!? What’s wrong? Why are you talking like Suzu-senpai? Are you alright? Did you eat something strange?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Kukuku! <em>Su-zu-sen-pa-i</em>? I don’t know someone like that!</p><p>I know of the spendthrift, vulgar, useless little Clochette who was nothing but a nuisance to others, though!</p><p>However, she’s no longer in this world! She’s dead!”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “She is!?</p><p>No, no, no—she’s not dead, okay!? Look, I have a text from her from this morning! Look at my phone!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Throw away that garbage! &lt;<em>DAAAMN, DESTROOOOOOY&gt;!</em>”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “MY SMARTPHOOOONE――!?</p><p>W-What’s wrong? You’re being strange! I don’t get what’s going on at all!</p><p>Please return to your usual, kind self, Shizuku-chan!</p><p>D-Do you hate me now?</p><p>Uwaaaan~! That’s it, isn’t it!? I’m just a good-for-nothing; a burden to the Rock Band Club, after all!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Aah, so that’s really what you’ve been thinking…</p><p>You idiot! Burden…? No one has said anything like that, right!?”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “U-Uuh…?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Ruka-chan. Even if you keep crying, shifting in place and worrying over things, there’s no use.</p><p>The seniors we loved are no longer! They’ve passed away! At least, in regards to Kimisaki Academy!</p><p>We can do nothing but push on with just the two of us, right!?</p><p>That’s why… That’s why I did my best and gathered all these people for the club! We can form a band with this! I’ll protect the Rock Band Club!</p><p>But, I want you with me too… It’s impossible by myself.</p><p>There was a time Kuromori-senpai got suspended, and President Seira was hospitalized, wasn’t there…</p><p>At that time, only the two of us alone were in the Rock Band Club.</p><p>It was because you were with me the whole time, Ruka-chan… that I was able to hold my ground.</p><p>Hey, you think you’re the only one feeling lonely? I hate this too! I’m lonely! So much I feel I’m going crazy!</p><p>If even <em>you’re</em> leaving me, I might break down! Stay by my side! I hate being alone!</p><p>I hate it! I’m not letting go of human warmth the second time!”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “Shizuku-chan…”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Is it because Kuromori-senpai isn’t around? Is that why you haven’t been coming here?</p><p>Then I’ll be her replacement for you!</p><p>Copy her foolish costumes and actions! And that laughing style that’s like a broken woman! Fuhaha!</p><p>Look! I’ll show you I can become a humiliating chuuni or anything you want!</p><p>Clochette is dead! So I’ll become her substitute!</p><p>‘Fujii’… the second kanji can be read as Inoshishi (<em>wild boar</em>)… so… umm… Innocentius! Call me by this name!</p><p>I’m not embarrassed! I’m already used to this! Be with me, Ruka-chan!</p><p>I’m begging you, please. Don’t… leave me alone.”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “Shizuku-chan… I didn’t want to become a burden to you like this;</p><p>I didn’t want you to get hurt for someone like me…</p><p>I’ve always been like this. Always dragging capable people, people with talent, down with me. It was the same with Onii-chan.</p><p>I lean on other people, put pressure on them, and twist them.</p><p>But… honestly, I can’t bear to do that anymore.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “I think I’m a bother, after all… so this is a good bye. You know, Shizuku-chan. Today, I came here to give you my resignation form.</p><p>You’re a drum expert, and good at singing, so I think you’ll make a great bandmate.</p><p>You’re even good enough to join Suzu-senpai’s band anytime now.</p><p>But I’m just going to pull you down with me… So even if I no longer dabble in music, I can still at least have your back and be your support.</p><p>I’ll fill that kind of position. A fan, or maybe a manager.</p><p>So you know, Shizuku-chan. It’s okay already…</p><p>If it’s you, Shizuku-chan, you can definitely be Suzu-senpai’s substitute. You’ll be able to fill the empty gap in my heart, I’m sure of it.</p><p>But you know, you shouldn’t do that. I don’t want to say this, but…</p><p>In this world, there are people who can never be good at what they do, even if they struggle to death.</p><p>Please, don’t let someone like that pull you down and make you waste your precious lifetime.</p><p>Rather than doing something idiotic like that, playing drums is definitely more worthwhile.</p><p>Hear my (<em>boku</em>) last wish, please. You can just desert me (<em>watashi</em>).</p><p>Please advance straight forward without hesitation. Reach the place where our seniors now stand on.</p><p>I’ll be cheering you on… and I’ll always be praying for you.”</p><h2 id="father-and-daughter"><strong>Father and Daughter</strong></h2><h3 id="part-1-2"><strong>Part 1</strong></h3><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “Lalala, lalala~ Lalalalala~</p><p>Dig up here~ One two three~</p><p>Make flowers blossom on the drooping trees~ The honest old man ate it cluelessly~ Hmm-hmm~</p><p>All riiight!

Then President Midori will pat my head like a good girl!</p><p>Everyone, please pleeeease bloom even more!”</p><p>(…Oh, whoops. Shouldn’t be giving them too much water or fertilizer, right? That’ll just backfire and make them wilt, yep.</p><p>Next, as much as it pains my heart, I’ll need to pluck out the weeds.</p><p>W-Which ones are weeds, again…? These are flower buds, so I shouldn’t pluck them, right… Hmm, hmm?</p><p>Hmmmm? It seems I haven’t studied enough.</p><p>Let’s take a pic and ask President Midori. ‘Am I supposed to weed these?’… there you go.</p><p>Oh whoa, it’s already this hour. I just noticed after looking at my smartphone screen—silly me!</p><p>Because it’s the Freshman Gathering today, there’s no class, but still…</p><p>I shouldn’t be late, should I?</p><p>President Midori is the Greenery Committee Chairman now, so from what she said, she’s taking care of the first years for the Freshman Gathering.</p><p>And I’m supposed to be helping her as an assistant.</p><p>I have to do that job properly too.</p><p>Ah, so busy! So busy I’d ask a kitty for help—though cats like to mess up the flower plants so they’re our natural enemy in the Gardening Club!</p><p>…I wonder if cats are edible?</p><p>Ehehe, I’m a little famished.</p><p>Thinking back, I woke up early to go to school and water the plants, so I don’t think I’ve had breakfast?</p><p>But I did prepare a lunch box, and the view looks great from here, so I guess I can eat here?</p><p>I should still have a little more time, I think.</p><p>No, but maybe it’s better to go to the classroom early…? Hmm?)</p><p>“…Ooh?”</p><p>(Is the person sitting on that bench Transfer student-senpai?</p><p>Fufu, yep, you can’t fool my eyes! He’s the only one wearing a gakuran around, anyway.</p><p>Should I try to sneak up and hug him from behind, just for surprise?</p><p>He’s been really busy with his student council work lately, so he hasn’t been showing up around the Health Committee.</p><p>I’m lonely~ He’s supposed to be <em>our</em> senpai!</p><p>I have my lunch box with me too, so I can share it with him…</p><p>Or hey, maybe he was lured to the rooftop by the smell of my cooking! Geez senpai, you glutton!)</p><p>“Se<sub>npai</sub> You want to eat my cooking that much, huh? I’m flattered!</p><p>Eat to your fill~ Mamma Mia~”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “…Whoa?”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “Hwe?”</p><p>(H-Huh? I couldn’t tell from behind because she was hidden by his back, but someone seems to be sitting on Senpai’s lap…?</p><p>Well this is, umm, who’s this? Umm? Umm~?)</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Hngh~… You’re Hino-san… aren’t you? Do you need anything from me? Or is it Papa you have business with?”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “P-Papa, you said?</p><p>Err, umm. You’re Shizuku-chan, right? …Shizuku-chan, are you Transfer student-senpai’s daughter?</p><p>No, but… he’s a third year and you’re a second year… And you’re parent and child?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Yeah. This person is my dearest Papa in the world~…</p><p>And as his daughter, he treats me like his dearest person in the universe~…”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “W-Whoa, please hold on a second! This smells inappropriate, somehow!</p><p>How perverse! I believe perverted things are <em>not</em> good!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “I don’t think there’s anything perverted about this. We’re not doing anything lewd, after all, right Papa?”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “It’s lewd as a <em>whole!</em> You’re sticking all over each other! It’s unfair—I wanna get lovey-dovey with Senpai too!</p><p>I-I’ll become your daughter too! You’re my Dad, Senpai!</p><p>Huh? But then that’ll make Prez Midori and Transfer student-senpai a married couple…?</p><p>That’s a rather irritating thought on its own… I feel this tugging in my chest…?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “No, Mama is Papa’s only bride, okay? And by Mama, I’m talking about Hassaku Tsuyuri-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “T-Tsuyuri-senpai is!?</p><p>What is that supposed to mean? Transfer student-senpai, how did you build such a happy family without me knowing!?”</p><h3 id="part-2-2"><strong>Part 2</strong></h3><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Hey… I don’t know what you want, but we’re in the middle of a serious talk. If what you need isn’t urgent, can you come back later?”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “Hwe? Serious talk? I don’t understand, are you troubled by something?</p><p>If it’s something I can help with, I’ll be happy to lend a hand!</p><p>I’ve caused lots of troubles for lots of people until now…</p><p>So I should help as many people in trouble as I can to make up for it! So President Midori told me~</p><p>Ehehe, I’m kind of a klutz, so I don’t know if I can be of any help, though.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “I’m happy just to know you feel that way. Thanks. Everyone in our school is so nice, huh…?</p><p>Well, you see. Hino-san, are you familiar with our Rock Band Club member Ruka-chan—Tsukinaga Ruka-chan?”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “Ruka-chan? Why of course! We’ve been in the same class since we were first years!</p><p>Sometimes, Ruka-chan would come to the rooftop to moan over songwriting.</p><p>I often come up here to water the plants too, so we bump into each other a lot.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Yeah, I heard; that’s why I came to the rooftop.</p><p>If I traced Ruka-chan’s steps, I thought maybe I’d be able to understand her feelings a little.</p><p>The rooftop is mostly locked, so I asked Papa, who had a master key, to open the door for me.</p><p>I had a little hope I might catch Ruka-chan here, but oh well.”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “The rooftop is mostly open lately, actually!</p><p>I haven’t seen Ruka-chan around here these days, but until just a while ago, she would help me with watering the plants.</p><p>Well, Ruka-chan and I came by each other a lot like that, so…</p><p>I think we’ve become close enough friends to indulge in idle chit chat. We pair up during PE too!</p><p>Ruka-chan is shy and withdrawn, so it took a while to get her to open up…</p><p>But it was no obstacle! For cultivating new lands—or digging up holes, you may say—is my specialty!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Right, it’s hard to understand what you’re really trying to say, but your point got across.</p><p>Hino-san, if you’re on friendly terms with Ruka-chan… can you help relay a message to her for me?</p><p>I screwed up my pep talk with her in the clubroom a little while back…</p><p>And she’s been avoiding me since, I think. I tried texting her and calling her, but she would never answer.</p><p>Even when I dropped by her class, she avoided me.</p><p><em>But</em>. I want to have a proper talk with her all over again.</p><p>I consulted Papa, and he said I better do that too…</p><p>Ruka-chan and I, we’re both not very good at talking. But we can’t get anything across without properly talking it over.</p><p>Ruka-chan is important to me. I don’t want us to drift apart like this.</p><p>Even if it means annoying her, I absolutely don’t plan to give this up.</p><p>Ruka-chan and I are <em>the same</em>. She’s an irreplaceable buddy of mine; a soulmate.</p><p>Mgyu! W-What’s wrong… Papa?</p><p>Don’t hug me all of a sudden, please! I’m not a baby! Auu, stop that, it tickles!</p><p>A-Are you trying to comfort me? Ehehe, I loooove it when you’re being kind, Papa~…”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “T-There you go acting all lovey-dovey whenever there’s chance!</p><p>It took me a little by surprise, actually. I pinned you as someone more strait-laced, Fujii-san.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Really? Well, I guess I’m not the type to grin without reason.</p><p>But just because I look stoic doesn’t mean I don’t feel anything…</p><p>And Papa understands that. Not just that, he can sympathize with me. He’ll hug me when I need it~”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “Well, Senpai’s the stoic type, too. Sometimes I wonder if he’s not actually a plant.</p><p>Should I water you, then? I’m sure it’ll cool the heads of you pair showing off such hot love so early in the morning!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “That’s going to leave us with a cold, so we’ll pass on playing with water.</p><p>I have a show to do today; I don’t want to trouble my bandmates by falling sick.”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “A show? Aah, Fujii-san, you’re participating in ‘that thing’ held today, too?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Yeah. ‘That thing’ Papa planned for some reason…</p><p>Well, we’re just there to heat things up. It so happens we have lots of newcomers in the club, too.”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “Really~? I’m envious. Like always, the Gardening Club doesn’t get any new members…</p><p>I wonder if gardening is too plain—if it seems boring for outsiders?</p><p>This year we have boys enrolling too, so it’ll be a help if they’ll just enter the club.</p><p>Gardening is mostly physical labor… It’ll be handy to keep boys around, you know?</p><p>Well, I guess not every boy craves physical labor like Transfer student-senpai.</p><p>The kids who came to try out whined and left without doing much, you know?</p><p>So well, I’m planning to do my best on ‘that thing’!</p><p>We’re planning to cook up the freshly harvested veggies into delicacies and serve them, so please, feel free to drop by if you’re hungry!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Sure, I’ll keep it in mind. Save for the concert, I’m pretty much free, so I can help you out too if you need an extra pair of hands.</p><p>In exchange, please pass my message to Ruka-chan.</p><p>‘<em>Absolutely come see the stage.’</em> If I sing with all my heart, and play drums with all I have… I’m sure my feelings will reach her.</p><p>I have faith.

Allow me to ask you once more: Are you in your right mind?</p><p>Listen—I, too, do not want to make a hobby of doubting my superior’s sanity after every little thing.</p><p>I am already fed up doing so much of that last year.</p><p>So I will not repeat it the second time. I am aware it will fall on deaf ears, in the end.</p><p>I personally do not find it pleasant to have my time wasted on <em>this kind of thing.</em></p><p>Today is the day of the Freshman Gathering.</p><p>Not only the students; parents and alumni are attending as well, so we are dealing with a huge crowd.</p><p>At present, things seem to be peaceful and without troubles, but…</p><p>I had wanted to patrol around the school for the sake of when troubles <em>do</em> occur.</p><p>But you suddenly summoned me—and I didn’t think it would be for such a <em>ridiculous</em> request.</p><p>Do you know how busy I am managing the crowd, handing out fliers, and guiding the guests?</p><p>I don’t want to waste my time being fooled around by your nonsense, President.</p><p>…Can you not at least respond to me? What an ill-mannered man.</p><p>Stop looking so scared for your life, please. I have no intention to chastise you.</p><p>If this is truly what you deem necessary, then let I, the Student Council Vice President, Yuuki Tomoko, unworthy though I may be, realize your command with every fiber of my being.</p><p>Yes, of course, for I am your sword.</p><p>I shall clear out the fog and cut open your path for you. I shall destroy your enemies and act as the blade nestled by your side.</p><p>That’s what I swore to do in the Selection Ceremony.</p><p>But if you wish to use your blade to kill yourself, I don’t mind.</p><p>As you desire, I shall cut off your neck and present your head to you.</p><p>And so, with that in mind, pleeeease think over it with a clear mind and answer, okay… President?</p><p>Why is it that I have <em>to wear a bunny girl outfit</em>…?</p><p>You always fail to explain. Why must you present me with such a… lewd… incomprehensible…</p><p>No, well, I suppose such strange costumes were not so hard to catch sight of last year.</p><p>I myself have had the experience of putting on those strange costumes, quite a few times.</p><p>But I am offended that you think I wore them based on my personal interest. I don’t have a cosplay hobby. I mean, <em>seriously</em>.</p><p>Be it with the maid outfit, or the princess dress, or lots others… I simply <em>had</em> to wear them, because there was the <em>necessity</em> for it.</p><p>In other words, you may say I am not against wearing a bunny girl outfit, provided there <em>is</em> indeed a proper reason on why I have to.</p><p>And you see, I am simply asking for that ‘reason’—for the ‘circumstances’ behind this request, yes?</p><p>…Why are you prostrating?</p><p>Did I ask you to? Are you listening properly to what I am saying—<em>hey?</em></p><p>Are you trying to make me angry?</p><p>Are you trying to say I am such a cheap woman, that I would cater to anything you order if you’d just get on all fours and beg?</p><p>You can’t tell me the reason, you say? Knowing you, you probably have taken on some random girl’s worries, and are trying to help them, right?</p><p>And because you can’t blabber to anyone about it, you’re keeping quiet, right?</p><p>How frustrating. Ah, no, how lonely. As student council members, we’re all your confidants.</p><p>I am your right hand. I’ve flattered myself as your partner, but——</p><p>Are you saying I am, to the end, just a stranger? Is that it…?</p><p>Geez, you’ve prepared a proper bunny girl outfit already. As always, your preparation is unnecessarily speedy…</p><p>You asked Minami-sa—<em>Natsumi-san</em>, to make it for you?</p><p>Don’t give her more job, please. Natsumi-san is already really busy as the student council treasurer.</p><p>Unlike you, you leisurely man who always wanders off somewhere.</p><p>Rather—is it not fine if you had asked Natsumi-san to wear this?</p><p>You two are quite close as childhood friends, are you not…? You shouldn’t have to ask me.</p><p>You can’t ask anyone other than me…? Do you want to see me as a bunny girl?</p><p>Do you need me…?</p><p>You’re saying convenient things as always. I know you just want to use me.</p><p>You shameless, abhorrent, idiot President. If you think I will always listen to whatever you tell me to do, you’re very <em>very</em> wrong.</p><p>I feel like you’re looking down on me. I am not your minion, you know.</p><p>I believe you misunderstand: I work under the ‘Student Council President’――</p><p>I merely work as the assistant of the person in that position. I do <em>not</em> have any personal feelings towards <em>you</em>.</p><p>Not the piece of garbage, scum that <em>you</em> are… Where is your answer, President?</p><p>Where in this world is a reason for me to listen to the ‘personal request’ of a maggot like you?</p><p>…Who said you could raise your head?</p><p>Prostrate. Crawl on all fours like the livestock you are.</p><p>After all, it is much easier to behead you with your nape visible like that.</p><p>Hmm… Well, I am no demon either,</p><p>This is about you; I am sure you have a reason.</p><p>I know… Like always, it’s useless to say anything to you, isn’t it?</p><p>Geez, there is no other choice, I see…</p><p>This will be the first and last time I’m doing this, okay? Please wait a moment.</p><p>…</p><p>Well, I have changed into it.</p><p>What is with that dumb look? How about you say something?</p><p>It looks good on me, you say? I do not feel the slightest bit happy about that. This vulgar… aah, I can’t face my ancestors anymore.</p><p>So? What am I supposed to do now?</p><p>Explain the details of the plan to me, President. I shall give my everything to act accordingly.</p><p>Ah, yes, I do not feel uncomfortable.</p><p>This is Natsumi-san’s handmade, is it not?

This is to repay me for when I cleaned your ears that one time? You still remember such a small happening…?</p><p>Even for me, that day was…</p><p>A day full of remembrance, where I became just a little closer to you, and opened up my heart for the first time…</p><p>….~</p><p>Fufu.

It so happens my uni friends has been bugging me about my alma mater… I’ve been kinda forced to show them around the academy.</p><p>I guess they took an interest when I recounted my experiences as a joke.</p><p>They’ve gotten themselves tired after walking all over, so they’re now resting at the food area – the gym.</p><p>As for me, I kinda miss this place ~ So I’ve been taking a walk around.</p><p>Seriously, it’s great to see it hasn’t changed, Kimisaki Academy~</p><p>So you know, while I was walking, I saw the Student Council Room… and recalled that <em>oh right, I was a member of the student council, wasn’t I?</em></p><p>I mean, yeah, <em>you’re not supposed to forget that, Minazuki!</em>―but moving on…</p><p>I thought if any of you were around, I should pop up for a greeting, so I took a peek… but then gosh, that lewd scene took me by surprise.”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “No, umm. That wasn’t it—please do not misunderstand.</p><p>President… Transfer student-san prostrated, imploring me to wear a bunny girl outfit no matter what.”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “You can keep calling him President.

Apparently, my height is gonna shoot up from now.</p><p>Next time we see each other, maybe you’ll be meeting a sexy, all-grownup version of Futaba Minazuki-chan instead~”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “Eeh?

No, umm, I’ve always been a light eater… and since it’s been so busy these days, I haven’t been getting much sleep.</p><p>I mean, that’s not it! What about Tomoko-san – did something happen to her? Why are you looking for her?”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Right. We really veered off our initial topic.</p><p>This isn’t a good habit to keep… Mizu-chan always just prattled on, so all I ever had to do was retort to her jokes or follow on her…</p><p>I think I’m not too good at talking on my own.</p><p>Anyway, well… I was having a meal with Tomoko-chan and Transfer student-kun in the gym–the food area…</p><p>But it seemed Tomoko-chan completely forgot that she was wearing a bunny girl outfit.</p><p>When someone pointed it out to her, she got beet red, kicked a fuss, and ran off somewhere.</p><p>You don’t know what that girl might pull when she gets too stimulated.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be a problem if she was slashing off the head of everyone she came by in the heat of her escape?”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Ah, so that’s why you’re looking for her.</p><p>But why was she wearing a bunny girl outfit…? I mean, yes, the theme for the Gathering this year is bunny ears, but…?”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “No idea. Seems transfer student-kun forced her to change into it.”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “The president? Hmm, lately, it does feel like he’s been working on something behind us…</p><p>Well, it’s okay. We’ll deal with it somehow. I know Tomoko-san’s number, so I’ll give her a call.</p><p>Tomoko-san is bad with tech in general though, so there’s no guarantee she’s carrying her phone around.</p><p>If it gets really bad, I can ask Maruko-san to use the school broadcast to call her over – we’ve been getting along well lately.”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Okay then, thank you.</p><p>Seems alright to leave it to you kids~ fufufu.</p><p>My friends from university live far, so I need to take them home; I’ll have to pardon myself.</p><p>Today has been a lot of fun. Thank you, I’m so glad I could see you… Hiyono-chan♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Yes, so am I. Please, do come over to play sometimes, Minazuki-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Minazuki:</strong> “Sure. But well, the leading role of Kimisaki Academy is you children now.</p><p>So you shouldn’t drag out the past with us alumni too much.</p><p>There are probably kids who can’t let go that easily.</p><p>But I should stop here. Sorry for keeping you? See you, bye-bee~☆”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “<em>Bye-bee</em>…♪”</p><h3 id="part-2-4">Part 2</h3><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Yes, yes. That’s right, she’s another student council member like me… the vice president, Tomoko-san.</p><p>If you catch sight of her somewhere, can you contact me?</p><p>Yes, of course. I understand. Thank you in advance♪”</p><p>(Okay. I think I’m communicating well with the new members of the Newspaper Club… probably.</p><p>I know I should learn to be more strict, like Fumi-san.</p><p>But I can’t seem to get rid of my habit of being all servile and meek, huh~?</p><p>I’m their boss. I have to act more important to suit my title.</p><p>I need to puff out my chest in confidence with a ‘huff♪’ like Fumi-san did.</p><p>Hnn~… It doesn’t suit me, huh? I’m always hunching over, after all. Whatever I do, I always end up looking up timidly at people.</p><p>This is just how I am… I have no choice but to work with what I have.</p><p>But… What did the new kids mean when they said I should come to the sports grounds?</p><p>They can’t be thinking of something untoward? Hmm?</p><p>Should I scold them off for acting on their own?</p><p>But no, maybe because they saw that I was busy with my student council duties… they were trying to be considerate by not reporting beforehand?</p><p>The grounds, huh… Sure, it’s been pretty noisy outside.</p><p>I thought… that it was because the guardians and other guests of the Gathering were going home?</p><p>It’s quite far so I can’t really tell, but are those food stalls outside?</p><p>I can hear music too… Nn~ I didn’t hear anything about such an event, though?</p><p>This isn’t good. I can’t see. My eyes have gotten bad; I should’ve made the decision of clipping my hair much earlier.</p><p>It was already bad enough that I was getting nearsighted from writing too much~</p><p>Maybe I should buy glasses. Like, one with an intelligent feel to get me the owns-the-place or bossy look…♪)</p><p>“Uhyaan!?</p><p>I-I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have been looking away while walking; I ended up crashing into you… wait, President?</p><p>Thank you for your hard work so far today♪</p><p>Yes, it has been pretty much going according to prediction on my side. I will make a report and submit it to you on a later date, okay?</p><p>On the other hand, things seem busy on your side~ as always. Please be careful so you won’t pass out from exhaustion.</p><p>You can rely on us more♪</p><p>…I don’t know what hidden agenda you have. But please at least say a word or two to us.</p><p>Even if it’s not something you can say to Natsumi-san or Tomoko-san…</p><p>You don’t have to hesitate to consult me about it.</p><p>As a student council officer, I can’t consent to troublesome rackets.</p><p>But as the head of the Newspaper Club, it’s more convenient to me when the school peace is disrupted…♪</p><p>Maybe I’m actually your snake in the grass.</p><p>Unlike Natsumi-san, you and I don’t know each other inside out.</p><p>And unlike Tomoko-san, I can’t be your right hand to fight your battles together, by your side.</p><p>But that’s why I can speak out about lots of things – that those two may demur from.</p><p>Oh no – I’ll write you into the school paper. And it’ll be entertaining… but full of things that may or may not be true♪</p><p>Someone like that is necessary, I think. After all, if everyone around you is a yes-man, you may not notice when you take the wrong step.</p><p>I will write your actions into the papers – objectively, and fairly.</p><p>Of course, whatever they read, the student body still hold the final judgment. But please, take it to mind that there’s more than one way of seeing things out there.</p><p>You must be in a hurry. I’m sorry for keeping you.</p><p>Please, keep standing at the center of our youth… and shine with all your power, President♪”</p><p>(…He left. Chaos really follows him everywhere, huh. But he’s such an interesting person~ like the protagonist of a story.</p><p>I hope you’ll allow me to keep watching you and the constant rackets that surround you from this VIP seat.</p><p>Okay then. I should get going to the grounds~ They did call for me.</p><p>There’s been no sighting report of Tomoko-san; she might’ve hid somewhere in her embarrassment.</p><p>The president seems to be pursuing that case also.</p><p>If I were to let an absurd predicament as <em>this</em> pass without any investigation… Fumi-san will get angry at me♪)</p><h3 id="part-3-2">Part 3</h3><p><strong>Location: Classroom</strong></p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “…Huh?”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hwee? Eh–what is this? You’re Hayate-san… right?</p><p>Why is she in this empty classroom… and what is this costume?”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Zzz, zzz…♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hayate-san is sleeping… Oh gosh, what in the world <em>is</em> this!? Call the manager down here!</p><p>Hwaaaa…♪ She usually acts all cool and smug, but look at <em>this</em>!</p><p>Look at this baby-like unguarded sleeping faaaaaaaceeeeeeeee!!</p><p>Omigooosh! You are so darn cute! You’re letting your guard down too muuuuch! You don’t even know who might be watching!</p><p>Oh, please have some awareness as a Hero of Justice! Geez, geez!</p><p>Hayate-sha… Hayate-san, Hayate-saaaaaaan♪”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Unnyu…?”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hau!? Oh no, I’ll wake her up making so much fuss!</p><p>I can’t wake her when she’s sleeping so comfortably~ She seems very worn out, too.</p><p>She’s the new Athletics Committee chairwoman, after all. I’m sure she’s been running around, taking care of the new students, throughout the Gathering.</p><p>She must’ve reached the limit of her stamina, and fallen asleep while taking a breather in an empty classroom.</p><p>I understand – no, I know!</p><p>I have my duties now. I can’t <em>look at you always</em>, like I used to.</p><p>I’m no longer a child squealing over pipe dreams and merely relishing in them. I’ve grown up – into a third year.</p><p>I know now, that there’s a human being inside the suit of a hero.</p><p>Unlike before, when all I could do was watch…</p><p>I’m no longer a scriptwriter only watching the actor act out the role of a hero, watching the stage.</p><p>I’m right beside you, Hayate-san. In this reality; in the same world.</p><p>I’m giving my all to stretching myself, taking the necessary step forward, without looking back.</p><p>Let’s stand next to each other, look into each other’s eyes sometimes, and maybe hold hands… as we walk onwards, now and into the future.</p><p>Let’s be our own persons.</p><p>We’re both girls, so we can’t marry like in that dream we once saw,</p><p>but ‘Hayate-san, the Hero of Justice’ is always in my heart… shining inside a story.</p><p>And I’ll monopolize that Hayate-san. She’ll be joined with me, for eternity. I pledge; that I will love you forever.</p><p>That’s why, Hayate-san… You should also care for your own life…</p><p>You don’t have to stretch yourself so thin that you’re passed out in exhaustion like this.</p><p>Take off your hero mask sometimes, and please, coddle yourself.</p><p>Love yourself. Because I’m also working hard on doing that for myself.</p><p>You are too good to be hammered into the idealized image a horrible writer like me made up…</p><p>You are too wonderful a girl for that, Hayate-san.</p><p>Then, I’ll be going… I have work to do.</p><p>Please have your rest, my dear Hero of Justice.</p><p>…Hyaan?”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Don’t go…”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Ha-Hayate-san? Y-Y-Y-You were awake!?”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “I wasn’t asleep at all, actually. I just nodded off a little because I was tired.</p><p>I was giving out flyers and attracting customers, being the Athletics Committee chairwoman. In this freaking dumb outfit.</p><p>What did they take me for, a <em>clown</em>? Definitely not a hero.</p><p>Aah, I’m tired… Hiyono, can you heal me~? I’m hopeless without you, you know~…?”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Err, uhh, Hayate-sha… You can’t just say that –</p><p>I was just finally coming to terms with it! W-We can’t! Hweeee~!”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Sorry, I must be troubling you… Really, I’m all beat – sorry for that.</p><p>I thought I was a more clever person. But recently, I’ve been hopeless beyond belief, y’know~…?”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “T-That’s not true! Hayate-san, you are the coolest and the cutest today, like always!</p><p>I love you the most in the universe – including your hopeless sides…☆”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “You’re the only one who tells me that, Hiyono~… Hiyono, Hiyono. Be by my side. Tell me what I need to do.</p><p>These days, I have so little clue on anything…”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “G-Gee, you’re so spoiled…</p><p>That’s not good, okay~? I’m also busy.</p><p>I-I’ve become a member of the student council. The Newspaper Club has also gathered a lot of new members, so this is an important time for us.</p><p>It’s a new semester, and we’re taking entrance exams for university this year… W-We have to hold it together.</p><p>That’s why I’m… huh, Hayate-san?”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “Zzz, zzz…♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Auu. She’s asleep; I guess she relaxed after hugging me.</p><p>She’s like a baby, really~ A newborn.</p><p>Just starting to walk her own life…</p><p>She said it a loong time ago, didn’t she? That she only started living after reading my articles.</p><p>I was happy. That’s why, as your author, I will take responsibility for giving birth to you.</p><p>It’s okay, you can do as you like; even call me ‘mama’. There, there♪”</p><p><strong>Hayate:</strong> “…♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyono:</strong> “Hayate-san.</p><p>It’s fine. This reality we’re in, this Kimisaki Academy… as you can see, everything is so peaceful here, even without a Hero of Justice to fight with her life on the line.</p><p>We will all definitely reach a happy ending…♪”</p><h2 id="bonfire">Bonfire</h2><h3 id="part-1-5">Part 1</h3><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “Hey, gather around! How’d you like some potatoes? They’re sweet, yummy P.O.T.A.T.O.E.S~☆</p><p>Sweet potatoes, steamed potatoes! Butter potatoes, fried potatoes!</p><p>We the Kimisaki Academy ☆ Gardening Club made these with all our love! Out-of-season potatoes~♪</p><p>We’re selling them for cheap~ For free, in fact!</p><p>There’s nothing more expensive than free, so… uh, in other words… they’re delicious~☆”</p><p><strong>Midori:</strong> “Kurumi-chan, you’re making too much ruckus.</p><p>Rather, you shouldn’t add unnecessary descriptors such as ‘out-of-season’.</p><p>Sure, we shouldn’t lie; but I also think there are things better left unsaid?”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “Nn~? Did I say something wrong?”</p><p><strong>Midori:</strong> “Honesty is a good thing. Still, I didn’t think the potatoes you accidentally mass-produced…</p><p>…would persistently last until spring. Their life force is amazing.</p><p>Well, I think we harvested everything this time.</p><p>But it’s quite interesting; I bet countries with starvation problem would be happy to have these seeds. Maybe we should research it more seriously.</p><p>They might’ve been the product of an accident, but they’re new seeds with unlimited potential.</p><p>You might be able to leave your name in the history of biology, you know, Kurumi-chan?”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “Hehe! Then I’ll name these new potato seeds the Kurumi Potatoes☆”</p><p><strong>Midori:</strong> “They won’t be able to tell if it’s a walnut (<em>kurumi</em>) or a potato… How about Kimisaki Potatoes?”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “Well, that’s food for later thought.</p><p>For now, let’s just distribute these potatoes we’ve made to as many people as possible! Here, here~! Have some potatoes~♪”</p><p><strong>Midori:</strong> “It helps me to have an energetic shop girl like you, honestly.</p><p>I can never imitate you – just standing in front of people in this costume is embarrassing enough…</p><p>Ugh, Konan-senpai started working in television after graduation…</p><p>And for some reason, she produced an anime of Princess Veggie<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> and got it nationally broadcasted… This costume’s gained an unwanted fame.</p><p>There’ve been people taking pics of us since a while ago…</p><p>I don’t hate that we’re attracting customers, but I don’t have much of a good memory with this costume.”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “Well, if we’re selling potatoes, it’s got to be in these costumes! Sweet ☆ Potato! La-la-la ♪</p><p>But, but! I’m actually a bit lonely that you’ve gotten major, Prez Midori.</p><p>You’re <em>my</em> President~ But they crowded around you that I couldn’t get close.</p><p>I… Princess Poison appears in the anime as a villainess, too.</p><p>So the children were looking at me like the killer of their parents, you know~?”</p><p><strong>Midori:</strong> “Right. Well, that’s why I had you change into Princess Veggie’s costume too.</p><p>Since we have these bunny ears-ish things, it fits with the theme of the Gathering, right?”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “Excuse me~ Not that it matters, but why am I (<em>boku</em>)… no, why am I (<em>watashi</em>) a cat-eared maid?</p><p>This year’s theme is bunny ears, right? Don’t I stand out?”</p><p><strong>Kurumi:</strong> “It’s totally fine, Ruka-chan! There’s no bunnies or cats once they’re in your belly~☆”</p><p><strong>Midori:</strong> “That’s very true. Mhm♪”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “The Gardening Club girls speak with really cryptic logic sometimes…</p><p>Ukh~ Not that I mind! I already called home to say that I’d be back later than usual, anyway~”</p><p>(According to Kurumi-chan, the Rock Band Club will be holding a show.</p><p>And Shizuku-chan… apparently said that I absolutely have to come watch.</p><p>But I have nothing to do until the show begins.</p><p>So as thanks for passing the message… I’m killing time helping out at Kurumi-chan’s booth.</p><p>I wonder what Shizuku-chan needs from me.</p><p>We parted on a bad note last time. I don’t know what face I should make when I see her.</p><p>But I won’t be able to sleep at night if I ignore her and go straight home.</p><p>But also, I really don’t want to see…</p><p>Shizuku-chan having fun, playing in a band with new members I don’t know.

And for the n-th time, Happy New Year.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Ooh, Shizu! I’ve been waiting for you! Happy New Year! And Rock ‘n Roll…!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Kuromori-senpai – I’ve been thinking of saying this for a while, but Rock ‘n Roll isn’t a greeting.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Eh? Then what’s Rock ‘n Roll!? I don’t know anymore—tell me, Shizu…!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “You’re as much of a pain in the neck as ever, so early into the year…. Anyway, not that I care, but what did you need from me, senpai? I was doing my first shrine visit with family; it’s annoying to have you call me out on a sudden notice.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Oh, you went to the shrine? Now that I look at you, you’re wearing an adorable <em>furisode</em> on you~”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “(sighs) Well, my parents like to waste money on my attires, for some reason… I jumped to your call without wasting time on changing because it sounded like an emergency, can I get a praise?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Of course! You’re such a good girl, Shizu! <em>Homehome</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Don’t say those words with that mouth of yours.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Eh!? I’m sorry, Shizu! I know it’s your catchphrase but I’ve wanted to say it just once! Cuz it’s cute!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Hmm… You’re being hyper today, Kuromori-senpai… Don’t tell me you haven’t slept? It’s easy to get hyper when running on no sleep.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Right. I was thinking to get some sleep when I get home, but then I got a call and had to do a U-turn in the middle of my way back… I took the train and came all the way here.</p><p>While having breakfast on a family restaurant around here, I did doze off and got some short shut-eyes, though.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “You should get a proper sleep. Kuromori-senpai, you look even more ill with those bags under your eyes from lack of rest… But anyway, so you were just called here, too?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Yeah. By someone I can’t ignore.</p><p>Still—Rock Band Club gathered yesterday, played until morning…</p><p>…and only just separated, right? Sorry that you guys got to go home only once it’s morning because of all the ruckus.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Yeah… I don’t know about you, Kuromori-senpai, but Ruka-chan and Prez both seem to have strict parents. I’m worried they’re getting scolded because of us.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Right… I called Ruka and Sera too, but they say they’re prioritizing their family today. Actually, I’m surprised you came, Shizu; was it okay?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Well… I’ve been acting sweet to my parents non-stop, and I’m tired. I was just looking for an excuse to leave; it’s a help you called me out here, actually.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “……Shizu. I didn’t know if it was alright to ask, so I never alluded to it; but are you getting along with your parents? It’s better to have good relations with your family, you know?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “It has nothing to do with you, Kuromori-senpai. And <em>you</em> never talk about <em>your</em> family too; are you not getting along, perhaps?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Mm… It’s not like I’m on bad terms with them. Just a little—well, it’ll be nice if you and I can both talk about this stuff like it’s all a joke someday.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “True. I really agree.</p><p>Well, leaving all that aside… Who called you here and what for, Kuromori-senpai? I can’t come up with a guess.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Right, don’t worry, I’ll explain. But we shouldn’t be standing around here. It’s cold out and all; seems there’s flu going around too.</p><p><em>…Achoo!</em>”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Ahaha. Look who’s sneezing right after saying that.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Ugh, well whatever… Our destination is Otouto-kun<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>’s house. Have you gone there, Shizu?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “By Otouto-kun, you mean the transfer student senpai, right?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Yep. Might as well say your ‘<em>Papa</em>’… <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> You’ve somehow gotten the habit of calling that boy <em>Papa</em>, huh, Shizu? Exactly why? It’s been bothering me.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Look at yourself, who’s taken to calling him <em>Otouto-kun</em> out of nowhere. Well, I do know the reason… If my memory serves, he’s the little brother of your lifesaver, right?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Yeah. I want Otouto-kun to think of me like a ‘dependable big sister’…~”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Mm—but if you’re the ‘big sister’ of my ‘Papa’, then you’ll be my ‘auntie’.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Eh!? I’m not old enough to be called that!</p><p>(<em>giggles</em>) Well I do want to get close to you like family… You may call me ‘Mama’, Shizu.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “……</p><p>…Tch…”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Eh, why did you click your tongue!? That sorta hurts…!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Oh, sorry. That was rude, huh? I’ll apologize.</p><p>Don’t worry, it wasn’t like I was thinking about how <em>someone like Kuromori-senpai should learn her place and not act like she’s on the same level as Hassaku-senpai. Don’t smugly call yourself my Mama, please.</em> Not at all.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Shizu~! You totally just confessed your true feelings! I have more maternity than you think, you know!? Look, look! (<em>doing some mysterious movements</em>)”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Stop acting stupid; we should get a move. I don’t know where Papa’s house is, is it in this complex?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “So I think. But sorry, while we’re walking I no longer have any idea where we are… I think, I’m kind of lost? Probably?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “For the love of… Fine then. I’ll just call Papa and ask him to pick us up.</p><p>Geez, it’s still early into the year and we’re already having troubles.”</p><h2 id="big-sister-and-daughter">Big Sister and Daughter</h2><h3 id="part-1">Part 1</h3><p><strong>Living Room</strong></p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Excuse us.</p><p>Ah, hello. Happy New Year, Papa~…</p><p>(<em>chuckle</em>) I’m sorry to intrude during new year.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Otouto-kun! Happy New Year! Suzu-oneechan is here to visit!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Kuromori-senpai, did you lose your chuuni somewhere on the way?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Don’t say <em>chuuni</em>! That’s my third most hated word in this world!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “How should I know? …Just curious, but what are the first and second?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “<em>That’s</em> where you’re biting? First is God, obviously! It’s all just an illusion the ignorant fools made up; while the second… Hmm? What was it again, Shizu?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Like I’d know.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Well, anyway! We shouldn’t be making a ruckus in front of the door; can we get inside? Shizu, do you have a change of clothes with you? You probably can’t relax in those.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Umm… I brought it in a paper bag, just in case. Furisode is hard to move in, so I’d personally like to change out of it quick.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “I see! Then you may change in the closet! It’s over here! &lt;<em>Come here</em>&gt;!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Acting like she owns the place… honestly, she’s been so strangely hyper today… I’m sorry for all the noise, Papa.</p><p>Huh, I look cute in furisode… you say? Thank you very much, Papa~”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Shizu, your attitude towards Otouto-kun is totally different from your attitude towards me, it’s like you’re two completely different persons! You can act more spoiled with me—O chick of broken-winged Lucifer…”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “If its wings were already broken as a chick, I don’t think it can survive the natural world. You just say whatever comes to your mind, seriously…</p><p>Then I’ll be changing for a bit. I’ll be borrowing the closet.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Should I help you change, Shizu? Furisode is hard to take off alone, right?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “That will be appreciated… I don’t know where to start with furisode.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hmm? Ah, we should come to your room after Shizu’s done changing, Otouto-kun? All right. You’ll be preparing tea and stuff for us while you wait, huh? Thanks for the hospitality!</p><p>Come on, Shizu, we’ll take that off quick! Can’t keep Otouto-kun waiting!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Wai—? Papa’s still here, don’t take my clothes off, please!”</p><p><strong>Room</strong></p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Hmm…</p><p>So in short, Kuromori-senpai will be taking care of Papa from today until the new term starts, right? And it’s all a request from that—who?—Kuromori-senpai’s so-called lifesaver.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Yeah. To be more precise, it’s Angie and her parents who asked me to.</p><p>Fortunately, I seem to be considered as Angie’s best friend. I’ve met her parents a few times too, and am on comfortable terms with the family.</p><p>They trust me enough to leave their precious ‘Otouto-kun’ in my hands.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “I don’t want to speak weirdly of people I don’t know—but which part of Kuromori-senpai is worth trusting in their eyes, I wonder? I mean, she’s a failure in society no matter where you look.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Well, I only became a Fallen Angel after Angie transferred out. Until then, I was just your run-of-the-mill gloomy schoolgirl; and I try to be polite in front of their parents.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “How you phrased it like ‘became a Fallen Angel’ is awfully suspicious enough.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “And anyway, Angie and her parents are perceptive people who can look into a person’s true worth. They must’ve sensed the pure brilliance of my soul!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Sure you want your ‘Fallen Angel soul’ to be pure and brilliant?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Oh, shut up. Anyway, that’s how it is. Their parents go on trips often, and Angie seems to be busy with something, so ‘this sort of thing’ happens often, I hear.</p><p>Usually, Otouto-kun’s childhood friend, Minami-san, gets to take care of him, but unluckily, she and family seem to be taking a trip to their hometown. And that’s how he ends up with me.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Hmm… I think if it’s Papa, he has a lot more options than just you, Kuromori-senpai…. You talk about taking care of him, but you’re useless with house chores, aren’t you?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “I may be useless right now, but I can learn! I mean, I’m in the middle of learning to cook already! Just leave it all to me, Otouto-kun! You can think of me as your ‘real older sister’ and act spoiled with me!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “I think being blood-related with someone like you is enough to make one want to die from shame. For one, you’re a full-on chuuni even though you’re third year in high school.</p><p>…But wait, if that’s the case, then why did you call me here? You don’t need me. I thought we were going to do another guerrilla live or something.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “No, but, uh… Otouto-kun is a healthy teenage boy, you know? Who knows what might happen if you leave us two <em>by ourselves</em> in a room?</p><p>Of course, I have faith in him! But there’s what society might think, and all!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “A Fallen Angel that cares about what society thinks… Mm, but yeah, I guess leaving a pair of man and woman to live under one roof for days is pretty risky.</p><p>Somebody needs to keep an eye on Papa so he won’t commit any adultery.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Just to make it clear, I’m not planning to stay over. I’ll go back home once it’s night! In short, I’m—what do you call it?—a commuting spouse!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “And now she’s claiming to be his spouse… Mm, it’s like I’m watching Papa having an affair… What to do, maybe I should give Mama a call?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “No, no. Hassaku-san is still being hospitalized, right? Don’t make her worry over your ‘affair’ business. It’s okay… Otouto-kun is a gentleman; nothing should go wrong.</p><p>Let’s all just be friends and enjoy this peaceful, temporary cohabitation# without trouble.</p><p>So that’s how it is! Incompetent though we may be, we’ll be sticking around for a while… Otouto-kun~”</p><h3 id="part-2">Part 2</h3><p><strong>Kodama Shrine’s Subsidiary</strong></p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Nyoon.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Chika-chan, over here!</p><p>Thanks for coming all the way to Onee-san’s hometown! Welcome!”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Nyoon! Nyoon! Nyoon!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Wai—it hurts, don’t hit me with your antenna! Onee-san <em>thinks</em> violence is not good! What’s wrong? Are you angry? Please return to the usual, kind Chika-chan!”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “It was faaaaaaaaaaaarrrr! Early in the morning, bottle-glasses contacted me asking <em>Let’s visit the shrine together~!</em> and I thought—<em>well, I had nothing to do anyways, so I might as well play nice</em>?—but I can see now that was a stupid idea!</p><p>I thought by shrine she meant the Kodama Shrine in the neighborhood, but turns out it’s the one in Chizu-chan-senpai’s hometown! And it’s awfully far! Can you imagine my surprise when she suddenly pushed me into the Shinkansen!?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Huh, did we forget to say? Yako-chan and I both are people from this area! Though Yako-chan is renting a room in an apartment near Kimisaki.</p><p>But I still live with my family, so everyday… I ride the Shinkansen to school. It’s quite a lot of trouble; well, I know I chose this for myself.</p><p>Chika-chan, can you think of it like a little out-of-town trip and have fun, maaybe?”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Nyuun… That’s asking too muuch. Theater Club just had training camp until yesterday, so I’m already tired of your faces. Didn’t I pretty much spend my entire break with the Theater Club?</p><p>Actually—I was planning to laze around from today until the new term starts. I was planning to sleep through my New Year! And you made me go on a journey around the island for noothing?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Shut your crap already. I paid for your tickets, so you didn’t lose anything from it, did you? Keep complaining and I won’t pay your transport fee back.”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Oh, please… I just received my New Year money so it’s not like I won’t be able to go home—but I don’t want to waste it all on transpoort… I want to buy new craft tools!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Craft tools… Chika-chaaaan, what about cosmetics and clothes?”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “I don’t need those… It’s not like I have anyone to show off to, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Eh, but there’s Transfer student-kun, right? Maaybe now’s a good chance to dress up and grab his heart? Love’s all about offense, Chika-cha~n!”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “I-I’m not in love, or anything? The relationship between Helpman and I can’t be summarized into such a cheap term it’s something more like the relationship of a master and servant kind-of, okay!?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “What the heck. Whatever. Chizuruuu… The both of us are pretty tired from the trip, can we rest before the shrine visit?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Yep, OK OK! It’s almost noon anyway; let’s take a rest in a café while having lunch. But it’s not very lively around these parts, so there aren’t many shops.</p><p>Should we at least pray for a bit then drop by my house, instead? You two will be staying over for a while, right?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Mm… Tomiko aside, are you sure I can stay?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “? Why? I’m happy to have you, you know, Yako-chan?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Mm… If worst comes to worst, I’ll just stay at my family house. I don’t really want to see Papa and Mama, but… well, they should be on a vacation outside the country around this time.”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Pft, bottle-glasses, you call your parents Papa and Mama, huh?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Huh? Is it strange…? I’ve been raised mostly abroad, so I just somehow took to calling them that. It’s not like I refer to them cutely because I love them so much, or that sorta thing.</p><p>More like I barely even remember their names.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Okay, this is going off to a gloomy direction, so we’ll stop talking about that!</p><p>So what do you say, girls? If you’re really that tired, I can go dash and see if there’s any shop we can visit. You both can sit somewhere around there and take a breather for the time being.”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Right… counting on you then. Y’see, Tomiko was sulking and wouldn’t walk on her own… so I pretty much had to drag her all the way here from the station. I’m beat.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Ahaha, that must’ve been tough… Oh, Chika-chan, you naughty girl!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “~…”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Hmm? Huh, Kodama-san!?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “…? Ah, Yakumo-san. Happy New Year.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Yep, Happy New year! Wowowow, what a nice coincidence! I didn’t think I’d see you in a place like this!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Yes, what a curious encounter. Or rather—we really do run into each other a lot.</p><p>Aah, right… Your house is around these parts, huh? I just recalled that you’ve told me about that over lunch; it’s all coming to me now.”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Nyoon! Hajime-oneesan, it’s your little sister, Tohmi Chika!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ahaha. Good day, Tohmi-san. I’m happy you like me so much, but I only have one little sister, Ichika.”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Kodama-saaan, HNY.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Konan-san. Yes, <em>HNY</em>, indeed… <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p><p>But what is the whole Theater Club doing here…? I… don’t believe you’re planning to continue your training camp so far out here, so do you have an event around, or?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “No, no; I just invited everyone to do the first shrine visit of the year in my hometown. I thought I’d show them the sights around these parts too, like a little fun tour, maaybe?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “A little tour? That sounds fun… Everyone in the Theater Club is always getting along so well. I’m envious.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Ehehe, don’t you think so? Kodama-san, how about joining us?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Oh, I’m happy for the invitation… but I’m sorry. I have a job to do here, so I don’t have much free time.”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Job? You’re working even over New Year? Talk about serious… Is it one of your shrine maiden jobs?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “You’re very quick on the uptake, Konan-san. You’re right; this shrine is a subsidiary of the Kodama Shrine… They’re planning to take it down, so I need to take care of the deity and stuff.</p><p>The demolition itself will be at the end of the year, but I need to make a list of what’s # and other things. It should be my parents’ job, but…</p><p>They’re currently busy flying all over the country for a ritual… so Ichika and I came to take care of it in their stead.</p><p>(<em>smiles</em>) Ichika seems to find it all bothersome, and has been complaining, though.”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Huh, lotsa places going out of business lately… But for a shrine to be closed down, this world sure is hopeless.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “(<em>chuckles</em>) Even if the shrine disappears, the deity is still left—even if the box disappears, the inside is still left—and even if matter disappears, as long as there is belief, then I’m sure it’s not the end. That’s what I’d like to think.”</p><h3 id="part-3">Part 3</h3><p><strong>Living Room</strong></p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Hmm… To be blunt: we have so surprisingly little to do.</p><p>Papa’s family didn’t leave a single chore to be taken care of… Make food and we’ll have nothing left to do.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Kukuku! What a mistake you have made, Clochette! This is the trap of sloth that God has assembled—He takes the potential of humanity from themselves and transform it all into sloth, so He may drop us all into the bottom of Hell!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Uh, it’s making everyday conversation hard, so can you take your chuuni somewhere else?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Laughable! No one may dye the color of another’s soul into something else! Let me raise in revolt to your foolish idea of twisting another person’s way of living to your liking! In short: no thanks!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Talk about selfish… You know you’re embarrassing the people with you, right?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “You’re embarrassed because you let yourselves think that way! Cast your shame aside, O Broken-Winged Lucifers, and scream out your entire existence to the world! Rock ‘n Roll!</p><p>Anyway, stop saying chuuni—can’t you see this stuff is cool? You can’t understand because you’re still a squirt, Shizu! Fuhahaha…!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Ouch ouch ouch!? Stop, Shizu! Stop hitting me rhythmically with those cooking chopsticks!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Ah, Papa… Can you please wipe dry all the plates that we’ve washed and return them to their place? We don’t know where we should put those, after all.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Right! It’s in your hands, Otouto-kun!</p><p>Hmm? The lunch we made was delicious… you say? Thank you! It was worth putting all that effort just to hear that from you!</p><p>Shizu was even less helpful than I thought, so it was tough just to make an easy dish… Look at this, see. I’ve been scrubbing this black, burnt part of the frying pan but it wouldn’t come off.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Mm… I’m sorry. I really can’t do much outside of playing drums.</p><p>Whaa? Please don’t pat my head, Papa… What? I should just grow on my own pace…?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “That is right! You have spoken the truth, Otouto-kun!</p><p>There’s no need to try so hard to learn to do <em>everything</em> in such a short time! We can watch for each other’s weaknesses! Even if it is nothing but licking each other’s wounds….!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Don’t just suddenly take a chuuni pose. Move your hands, please. Well, it’s just utensils for three people, we’ll finish washing in no time.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Yes. Well, really, there’s no need to hurry. Just do it ‘on our own pace’.</p><p>(<em>chuckles</em>) When we line up in front of the washing basin like this, it’s like we’re truly a pair of newly-married couple… Aah, Shizu’s seriously starting to look like a beloved daughter of mine~</p><p>Shizuku-cha~n? Thank you for helping me wash the dishes… Homehome~…”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Gya!? Eh, why did you kick me!? I’m against violence…!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Hmph… All right then, we’re done with the dishes. What should we do now? I don’t think we have any more left to do. I think we can even go home if we want.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hmm… But Otouto-kun must be lonely without his family home. I want to stay with him longer—I still want to play the role of his older sister more, or rather… I want to take care of him more.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Well, even if you’re saying you want to act like his big sis… What’s there to do? I’m an only child, so I don’t really understand.</p><p>Wait, I’ll look it up on my smartphone.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Oh, you’re such a modern-day girl, Suzu! You little~!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Don’t pinch my cheeks for no reason, please… What in the world is wrong with this person? She’s been so unbearable today… Did her nervousness in this unfamiliar situation made her lose a screw or two?</p><p>Hmm… After looking it up on my phone, lots of examples for a ‘model big sis’ came up. For the time being, why don’t you imitate them?</p><p>See here… It seems making this kind of pose then saying ‘Leave it all to Onee-chan!’ is popular lately.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Huh. I’ve seen that somewhere before.</p><p>Anyway, I hate imitating people, or acting out some kind of popular personality. It goes against my aesthetics. I’m seeking for something more authentic—I want to master the more basic principles there are about being a big sister.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “You’re asking for a lot… Hmm, well, it’s a bit simple but what about giving ‘lap pillow’? Looking up, I’m seeing lots of illustrations of a big sister-like character giving their little brother lap pillow.</p><p>Also, nannying.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Nannying!? Eh, eh—I don’t really get it but perverted stuff is not good…!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Mm, it’s nothing perverted, I think. Basically acceptance, motherly qualities, and warmth? Something of the sort. Those are kinda big sister-like, right?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hmm, this ‘big sister’ stuff is deep…!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Well, we have a lot of time, so why don’t you try out some of these as you like? Go for it until you’re satisfied, Kuromori-senpai.</p><p>I’ll go along to kill some time during the New Year break.”</p><h3 id="part-4">Part 4</h3><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Come to me, Otouto-kun.</p><p>Ehehe. You can act spoiled all you like to this Suzu-onee-chan…</p><p>I-Is this fine? Am I doing this right? Tell me, Shizu!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Stop going to me for everything, please. And stop moving so much, you’re giving him a lap pillow, after all… Keep moving like that and Papa’s head will slide off your lap to the floor.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Okay. I’ll try not to move. I’ll see what I can do. …Umm, can I pet Otouto-kun? I really want to! But uh, maybe it’s too high-technique for me?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “I dunno, play by the ear. Just do whatever you feel like, geez.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “I see. Then I’ll do what I like! Ehehe, you good boy…</p><p>You’re a good boy, Otouto-kun…”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> (Looking now that I’m calmer: what kind of situation is this… I mean, nothing wrong with peace I guess. Kuromori-senpai’s looking unnecessarily happy about it, and Papa’s relaxed too.</p><p>Papa’s usual position doesn’t give him much chance to be spoiled.</p><p>He assists the student council, and has to run all over to help all sort of people out… Papa’s always working to the bone…</p><p>In reality, maybe sleeping on someone’s lap and being patted on the head like that makes him happy. Please rest and take it slow, sometimes… at least during breaks.)</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “…Nhyaun!?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Ooh? What’s wrong, Kuromori-senpai? Don’t raise such a weird shriek… Did Papa touch you somewhere strange? Papa, there’s punishment for naughty children, you know?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “No, Otouto-kun’s fallen asleep… But I feel something vibrate. Ah, I think it may be smartphones…</p><p>It’s mine. Shizu, it’s hard for me to move with Otouto-kun sleeping on me… Sorry, but can you get my smartphone?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “You’re such a troublesome senpai… Let’s see… Ah, found it.</p><p>This is your smartphone, right? Uwah, it’s full of accessories.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hehe. Isn’t it cool? …Hmm, since it’s still vibrating, I guess it’s a call. Who’s it from?</p><p>Oh, it’s Yakobu. That’s rare; she’s usually too stingy with phone bills to make a call to anyone.</p><p>Hello, Yakobu? What’s up?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Yakobu… Aah, Konan-senpai from the Theater Club, huh. One of Kuromori-senpai’s few friends.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hm… Yeah… Well, I guess I’m free, yeah; but I have an important duty I must attend to… Right. Angie asked me to care for Otouto-kun.</p><p>Eh, then I should bring Otouto-kun with me? Ehh… but it’s break, so I wanted to let him rest for once… Right. Okay… Well, I’ll listen to what you have to say.</p><p>Ah, right. I got it, I got it. I owe a lot to you, after all. We’re friends, we should help each other in times of need. Right… Right. Understood. Leave it all to me.</p><p>See you then, Yakobu. I’ll hear out the rest when I get there. I might head to you alone at worst… Yeah. Once again… Happy New Year.</p><p>…Geez, she never changes, always such a troublemaker.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Kuromori-senpai~ What did Konan-senpai ask from you?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Right, I don’t really get it, but it seems she’s got trouble over at her hometown. Said something about some musical performance.</p><p>She’s already on the location, and moving around wastes time, so she wants me to bring her all the necessary stuff. And help out with the musical while I’m at it, she said.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “A <em>musical</em>… How is it turning into another wild situation again?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Like I’d know. But well, seems she’ll cover the train expenses, and she’ll pay us if the musical ends in success… Maybe it’ll be a good addition to our club’s budget for the next term.</p><p>It seems the stage will be a shrine, so we can do our first shrine visit of the year there too. Well, she told us to not be so nervous and just come over to play, think of it as a tour with close friends over break.</p><p>I was thinking to go alone, but I want Shizu and Otouto-kun to come to, if it’s fine with you guys. Seems there are small tasks to take care of; and you can be part of the show with your drum skills and singing, Shizu.</p><p>You can play drums all you want, y’know?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Hmm… I need to ask for my parents’ permission if it’s a far trip. But I’ll feel nervous if I just stay at home, so I think this is a good chance.</p><p>I can have a trip with Papa and everyone else… It seems fun, like a little adventure.”o</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “(<em>chuckles</em>) We’re just taking the Shinkansen to a place inside the country, so I’m not sure about adventure.</p><p>But I think we’ll end up having to stay over, so I’ll tell your parents for you.</p><p>I’ll say it’s a Rock Band Club activity. You know, training camp or the sort?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “I appreciate that. Well, my parents really spoil me, so I think they’ll be fine even if you say it’s a pleasure trip.

Y’know how fast it was that the view went <em>byuun!</em> Like <em>byuun</em>!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Ahaha! Geez, Kuromori-chan, you’re too excited! Instead of returning to your original personality, <em>maaybe</em> you went a little too far back to being a toddler?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “……!? Don’t so casually address me, Bi*ch!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “No way!? I’m not a bi*ch! I just fall in love easily!”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Hey, what’s all the noises for… We’re not in Kimisaki. You can’t be bothering the other guests, damnit.</p><p>…Oh, you got here fast, Kuro. Sorry for asking for your help out of the blue.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “It’s fine. Aren’t we friends? By the way, it was impossible to carry all the stuff you asked by myself, so I asked a delivery service and I think it’ll arrive a little late. Probably around early morning tomorrow?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Got it. Thanks for that, you really saved me. Have all the rest you want today. I’ll explain you the details tomorrow.”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Kuromori-senpai~ Don’t go ahead by yourself, please. We don’t know the room number either, so if you leave us alone we’ll be completely lost.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Ah, sorry… This is the room we’ll be staying! Shizu, Otouto-kun, you should greet everyone! We’ll be in their care for a while, fuhahaha!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Ah, hello… I’m Fujii Shizuku, from the Rock Band Club. I’ll be in your care.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Oh, how polite~ Umm, is it just Kuromori-chan and Shizuku-chan from the Rock Band Club? As for Seira-chan and the rest… I guess they can’t come in such a short notice, huh?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Yes… We did call them, but they seem busy with the new year. They said they’ll catch up if they can later, but since it’s far and all, I think that’ll be difficult.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “I see… OK, OK! I know maaybe it was a pretty unreasonable demand, so having you guys come here at all <em>is</em> something to be grateful for!</p><p>Nyufufu. Shizuku-chan, you don’t seem well, do you? Did the long trip tire you out, maaybe?”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “No… Kuromori-senpai was so energetic, it was tiring just to keep up with her. While we were riding on the Shinkansen, she kept yelling and stuff. She’s one Fallen Angel to deal with.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Ahaha~ Kuromori-chan has that childish side to her, huh?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “What, got any complaint, Bi*ch? …Ah, Otouto-kun. Thanks for carrying our luggage.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Transfer student-kun, welcome! We’re waiting for you, maaybe! Guys, put away your luggage and have a rest. I’ll pour some tea for you!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “Ah, no need for the trouble… Umm, are we all going to stay in the same room?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “We have more than one room! For one, we can’t have Transfer student-kun sleep with us. It’s pretty abandoned around these parts, and they have lots of empty rooms, so we were able to borrow a few for cheap.</p><p>But you know, it must lonely to just kill time at each rooms alone, right? Maaybe? So well, we’re all gathering here until it’s time to sleep.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hmm. To think we can stay in such a nice inn for free—what a luxury!”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “But we’ll work you hard to make up for it, obviously~ Though you guys are helping us out of your good will… so I wouldn’t push that many demands to you, relax.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “There it is~! Yako-chan’s totally unreliable consolation words: saying stuffs like ‘relax’ at the beginning only to make all sorts of unreasonable demands later anyway!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> &quot;(<em>chuckles</em> ) Konan-san can be like that sometimes, huh?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Whoa!? Don’t erase your presence and sneak up from behind me!</p><p>You are… Kodama Hajime…! You came, huh!? You arrogant, sham of a priestess, falsely presenting yourself as a God…!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “I’m… not a God. At the very least, I’ve never truly claimed myself as such, Kuromori-san.</p><p>We were both ‘student council president candidates’, but we never really talked, right? …Do you hate me, perchance?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hmph… I <em>despise</em> people like you—fake saints pretending to be pure, acting like you’re the only one without any sin in the world! Aah, how unpleasant! Why must you be here!?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Well, Kodama-san’s the reason we’re all here, so it’s natural she’d be <em>here</em>. By the way, she’s paying for our inn stay too, so you’d better watch your words.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “No, it’s not so much <em>me</em> as it’s the Kodama branch shrine.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hmm? I don’t really get the situation, so I can’t understand even if you babble all that stuff at me! I think I’d rather have you explain everything first anyway!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “(<em>chuckles</em>) Now now, no need to be so hurried. Let’s all sit and relax…</p><p>They say ghosts would drop by noisy places at night, you know, Kuromori-san? There’s a hot spring here too, so you can take a bath and wash away your sweat first.</p><p>I think you can wash away all the negative feelings too. If you enter a nice, warm bath, I’m sure you’ll feel all the irritation and anger disappear.”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Hah! Whatever you say sounds like preaching! This is why I can’t stand shrine maidens and nuns and the like—all you fake clergies!”</p><p><strong>Shizuku:</strong> “If <em>she</em> sounds preaching, you’re much worse off, Kuromori-senpai…</p><p>But well, what a weird gathering… Rock Band Club, Theater Club, and a shrine maiden?</p><p>It seems we’ll really have a wild start to the year, huh… Papa?”</p><h2 id="shrine-visit">Shrine Visit</h2><h3 id="part-1-2">Part 1</h3><p><strong>Kodama Branch Shrine</strong></p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Good morning, Transfer student-kun. Did you have a good sleep last night?</p><p>Fufu. Are you taking a morning walk to get rid of the sleepiness? But it’s really chilly in the morning, so I think you can wear more layers of clothes.</p><p>And it’s an unknown area for you, too, so you might end up lost going off by yourself. There are lots of people who will be sad over your disappearance, so please take care.</p><p>(<em>chuckles</em>) I’m sorry to lecture you so early in the morning. This isn’t good; it seems I’m becoming more talkative.</p><p>I tend to worry over little details, and fuss over every little thing… I’m the older sister of a certain ‘adorable little sister’ who’s prone to failure, after all.</p><p>But if I keep being so wordy, maybe people will hate me… Hmm? What’s wrong? Why are you staring at me like that?</p><p>Huh? ‘I see, this is how a big sister is like’… you say? What does that mean? This is a little hard… Hmm~?</p><p>I see. I don’t really understand, but Kuromori-san is acting as your ‘big sister’ right now, huh? Do you want me to give her an advice, since she seems so troubled over it?</p><p>(<em>chuckles</em>) I should show her what a big sister is like, you say? I wonder~ I don’t think it’s something to be taught.</p><p>In the end, I’m just <em>Ichika’s</em> older sister. The only one who knows how to be <em>your</em> older sister is the person herself, or you, who know her well.</p><p>When you think about it like that, aren’t the Theater Club girls amazing? They can get into any kind of role. I often watch their rehearsals and shows too… and I’m amazed every time.</p><p>I wonder what it’s like… Not just how you were born, or how you were raised… but sometimes, your gender and race would differ per role too. To see through the eyes, hear through the ears, feel through the skin—and live the life of someone completely different from you…</p><p>I wonder, how does that feel? I’m the successor shrine maiden for the Kodama Shrine, sometimes revered as the Living God—I’ve always lived inside the frame people set up for me.</p><p>But those girls go beyond their own frame and live with freedom. They always appear so bright to me… I feel like I’ve been envious of them for so long.</p><p>(<em>chuckles</em>) I’m sorry. I think I’m still a little sleepy. I ended up blathering something vague.</p><p>…Yes, as you can see, I’m cleaning the shrine.</p><p>The person taking care of this shrine is not currently available. So I’ve been deployed to replace them for the time being. As the representative of Kodama Shrine, I have the duty to maintain this branch well.</p><p>In the first place, cleaning early in the morning is a daily activity for me. So doing the same activity as usual, at the usual time, really calms me.</p><p>It’s the season for shrine visits, so there are many litters around; someone needs to sweep and clean up. I want everyone to greet a new year, a new day, in a neat environment.</p><p>That’s why we have big cleaning at the end of the year, and that’s why I’m sweeping the place with a bamboo broom right now.</p><p>Hmm? You’re going to help, Transfer student-kun?</p><p>Thank you. This shrine hasn’t been taken care of for a long time; it’s abandoned and rather dirtied… It’s tough to clean everything myself.</p><p>I’m really saved, but is it okay? You’re always helping people out, so if you ever find yourself thinking ‘I can’t take it’ or ‘too much’, I think you should rest, or talk to someone.</p><p>Because you see, that was what I failed to do for a long time… and it was so hard.</p><p>Oh. I see. So you’re okay. You’re having fun and you’re happy. Then I’m really glad.</p><p>Fufu. The cleaning tools are on the storage over there… Please go get them, Geboku-kun<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>.</p><p>…H-Huh? You froze.</p><p>Isn’t Geboku-kun your nickname? Hii-chan gave it to you, right? It’s something like how she calls me ‘Jime-jime’, right?</p><p>Or is it more like ‘Living God’; something shameful, something you don’t want to be called by…? But it was Hii-chan who gave it to you, so…?</p><p>(<em>chuckles</em>) I guess I really shouldn’t do things that are out of character, huh?</p><p>Once again… Let’s work hard cleaning together, Transfer student-kun~”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Hmm? Ah, you’re right. There’s Ichika next to the warehouse? She’s just standing without doing anything… I wonder what’s wrong?</p><p>Right, I thought it’d help her wake up, so I asked Ichika to clean with me. That child, she hates doing troublesome things, so she whined, but…</p><p><em>But</em>. Our parents asked me <em>and</em> Ichika to maintain this branch shrine… so I need to work her some.”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ichika? What’s wrong…? Are you still sleepy, perhaps?”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> (Hmm, I wonder if I shouldn’t have brought her too far from the Kodama Shrine. But I’m with her, and this is the branch shrine, so it should be fine… at least I thought so.)</p><h3 id="part-2-2">Part 2</h3><p><strong>Kodama Branch Shrine</strong></p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ichika.”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “…Hya!?</p><p>Aah, that surprised me! <em>Here comes something beautiful! Dazzling! Shining! Precious! Could it be the first sunrise of the year!?</em> was what I thought, but it turned out to be my big sister~! Oh thank the heavens…!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Fufu. It’s January 5th already, so I don’t think you can call any sunrise the first of the year anymore.”</p><p>(…Thank goodness. She’s a little weird, but she’s still the usual Ichika.</p><p>I don’t feel any strange presence, so maybe she really <em>was</em> just a little sleepy.)</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “What’s wrong, Onee-chan? You’re staring with this kind of mushy-squashy gaze?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Mushy-squashy? No, I’m just thinking how you’re your usual self, Ichika~…”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “Who else would I be~? Aren’t you still dozed off, Onee-chan? You seem to think you have everything in control, but you’re always acting like a silly airhead in the morning, you know.</p><p>Huh? There’s Transfer student senpai! Right, apparently you joined us last night or something? I was asleep back there, so learning that the morning after kinda surprised me!</p><p>Eh? Ah, yes. Happy New Yea~r…?</p><p>Uh, huh? Wait, what’s up with this? Transfer student senpai being around <em>surely</em> has no connection with Onee-chan looking happy, right!? Ugh, I feel a disturbance inside my chest…!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ichika, stop looking like you’re ready to kill with that bamboo broom. Sheesh, you’re such a strange child.”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “Well, about that… I’m <em>your</em> little sister, after all.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ah, that was sarcasm, right? Even <em>I</em> understand that. I’m strange, so of course my little sister who shares my blood would be strange, that’s what you meant, right?”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “See? You’re always so prickly in the morning, Onee-chan! And for some reason, during mornings you think we’d be late, you’d be cutting ingredients to make miso without stop!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “My, my? Just as I thought it was a little lively…?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “…Oh, Yakumo-san. Ahaha, you caught me in an embarrassing state.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “No? I’m jealous since you sisters seem to be so close! I’m an only child, after all. I want a little sister, or an older sister too!”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “I-I’m not giving my Onee-chan to anyone, okay? She’s <em>my</em> Onee-chan only! Forever!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “I’m not taking her~ Well, I, Yakumo Chizuru, am everyone’s reliable Onee-san in the Theater Club, see! So I welcome any girls wanting to be my little sister!</p><p>Ehehe! Leave it all to Onee-san!”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Ah. That’s the one. I thought I’ve seen that somewhere before, so it was you, Bi*ch.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Maaybe you can tell me what you mean? And please drop that bi*ch calling already! At least call me Yakumo-san like in the past!”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Yeah. You know, that word is actually a worse insult than Japanese people think.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Yako-cha~n, you’re so late. You arrived even later than Kuromori-chan, who’s weak at sports… You have not tempered yourself enough, young woman! Look and learn from Onee-san!”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “No, no. This brat stopped moving in the middle, so I dragged her by her cowlick.”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Nyoon!? Ouch ouch ouch! My cowlick isn’t a leash and I’m not a dog, okaay!? I’ll sue you for corporal punishment someday…!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Wow, you’re all gathered… What were you all doing, with such seemingly cold clothes?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Nyufufu! It’s my routine to go running early morning. But my home’s far from school, so when I think I’ll be late, I run at night and not in the morning.</p><p>Stamina is what an actress needs, after all. I’m a still a learning chick, but I mean to always be an actress at heart… Ah, wasn’t that line just now maaybe kinda like A Little Princess!?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “You mean that line about how her heart’s always like a princess? Well, that’s just like you~… Ah geez, I end up wasting so much energy in the morning.</p><p>I meant to run just to shake off the sleepiness, but she made me run for kilos.</p><p>I don’t really return here often so I don’t know which way leads where, too… If I gave up in the middle, I wouldn’t be able to return to the inn, and ended up dead on the roadside. Really regretted this one.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ahaha. So you all joined in Yakumo-san’s morning routine and went jogging.”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Yeah. We woke up a little too early, and there’s still some time until breakfast. Though the girl with Kuro… Shizu, was it? She’s still asleep, looking tired from the long trip, so we left her at the inn.”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “I-I was sleeping too but you kicked me awaake! What’s with this discrimination…!? Why can’t you be kind to your people, bottle-glasses!?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Shut up. You’re always acting so spoiled, anyway. If at least <em>I</em> don’t treat you harshly, you’re gonna rot into a useless girl. Y’know what they call this: carrot and stick.”</p><p><strong>Chika:</strong> “Nyoon! Helpmaaan! Hajime-onee-saaan! Please save my poor, pitiful self being abused by this demon! If this keeps up, my cowlick’s going to wilt from the stress!”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “That thing can wilt? You think it’s a plant or something? …Kodama-san, it seems you’re cleaning. Should we help?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Yeah, yeah! We just kinda went with the flow, but you paid for everyone’s stay at the inn! We’ll offer you our service to make up for that~ Meow, meow!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “…<em>Meow meow</em>?</p><p>(<em>chuckles</em>) I don’t really get it, but it’ll end in no time if you’ll all help me. Ah, no… I’m sure whatever hardship in front of us, it’ll all be just a piece of cake.</p><p>Thank you. Everyone in Kimisaki Academy is so nice… I’m so glad you’re here, really. And I’m proud to be one of you.”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “You’re always so stiff, huh… You know what they say about hypocritical courtesy? Honestly, I think just a ‘thank you’ should cut it.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Yes. I guess you’re right. Thank you, everyone~…”</p><h3 id="part-3-2">Part 3</h3><h3 id="part-4-2">Part 4</h3><h3 id="part-5-2">Part 5</h3><h2 id="secrets">Secrets</h2><h3 id="part-1-3">Part 1</h3><h3 id="part-2-3">Part 2</h3><h3 id="part-3-3">Part 3</h3><h3 id="part-4-3">Part 4</h3><h3 id="part-5-3">Part 5</h3><h3 id="part-6">Part 6</h3><h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Homehome is Shizuku’s trademark SFX(?) for when she’s rewarding people for their achievements.

    <url>/2019/eg-yae-birthday/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<div class="note info"><p>Accessible from the “Stories by Student &gt; Nagamachi Yae &gt; Other” tab in Ensemble Girls! Memories.</p></div><p>Yae’s substory, set on her birthday. It doesn’t actually have a title, so it’s hard to document…</p><p>Before the second arc of Engirls’s main story, this was the only source of the “Angie can drive” tidbit.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="nagamachi-yae">Nagamachi Yae</h2><p><strong>Written by:</strong> Akira</p><p><strong>Yae:</strong> “Onii-san, good evening!</p><p>Hey hey, I swear it’s just for tonight, so can you let me stay over? I’m not listening to your answer! I’m coming in!</p><p>Mugu!? Don’t grab me by my head, you’re gonna break my neck!</p><p>I’ll tell you the details later… Wait, whoa? Who’s this? It’s a woman I don’t know!</p><p>Are you Onii-san’s girlfriend?</p><p>Ah, you’re Onii-san’s big sis?</p><p>Come to think of it, I did hear about Onii-san having a big sis! Hello!</p><p>You’re Onii-san’s Onee-san… So you’re ‘Onii-onee-san’… or ‘Oninee-san’ for short?</p><p>Like <em>Demon Big Sis</em>, ahaha!</p><p>Mugyu!? Why are you hugging me!? You like how I call you ‘Oninee-san’!?</p><p>You’re so weird. I think you and Onii-san might be alike.</p><p>Oninee-san, what do you mean ‘Can we keep this girl?’…? Mggaah, I’m not a pet you can just pick up, okay?</p><p>I’m Nagamachi Yae; Kimisaki Academy 1-B! Nice to meet you. I’ll be in your care for today~</p><p>I’m not gonna cause any trouble, so relax, okay?</p><p>If you guys would just lend me your backyard, I’ll roll a sleeping bag there and take care of myself.</p><p>I have provisions too! Onigiri, donuts, milk~</p><p>So anyway, that’s how it is! I’ll be in your care! The backyard is this way, right?</p><p>Yaaay, are you going to carry my sleeping bag and other stuff for me, Oninee-san? You’re so nice!</p><p>You’re really like Onii-san’s Onee-san!</p><p>Mugugu! Why do you keep grabbing my head… Okay, I know I’m short so my head is in an easy place to grab…</p><p>‘Explain about this properly’? I guess I should… Umm, see~</p><p>I’m running away from home for a bit!</p><p>Mom and Dad were so blind it pissed me off, so I ran from home!</p><p>I thought about staying at Ichika’s, but on my way there, I spotted your house…</p><p>So I came to stay over at your place!</p><p>I spent the night here during the stay-over party too, so I thought you’d let me if I ask.</p><p>My parents will quickly know when I hide at Ichika’s, so there’s not much point in running away in the first place.</p><p>But my parents don’t know Onii-san’s house yet, so I don’t have to fear being caught, you know? It’s perfect!</p><p>So I’ll be staying here! I’ll help with the chores too! Just leave it all to me!</p><p>Eh, my reason for running away? Umm, well, it’s nothing really big.</p><p>Uhyaa!? Oninee-san, why are you lifting my skirt? Pervert!</p><p>No, no, no, I’m not ‘being abused’ or anything! Sure, my thighs are full of fresh scars…</p><p>But they’re all from my Softball Club practices, or from taking care of the animals at the school barn, or adventuring through the underground tunnels…</p><p>I just have a lot of chance to get scars in my routines, that’s all!</p><p>Ugyaa!? Why are you both hugging me!? ‘You can think of our place as your home, Nagamachi-san’…?</p><p>Don’t turn this into some cheap soap opera!</p><p>What’s with these siblings!? You’re both such a pain!</p><p>No no, I think you’re still misunderstanding me! It’s not like I’m not getting along with my family, we’re always such cozy bunch!</p><p>Don’t sympathize with me! I’m not a pitiful girl!</p><p>Huh wait, what are you doing, Onii-san? You’re calling my home?</p><p>W-Why do you know my home number? You’re so full of mysteries!</p><p>Stop that! I need to teach Dad and Mom a lesson!</p><p>So you see, I used to be a really selfish brat… I always went around saying ‘I want this’ and ‘I want that’ and troubled my parents a lot for it.</p><p>I never did chores and only ever complained too. Guess it was my rebellious phase or something…</p><p>But I reflected on many things after entering high school…</p><p>So I tried to act the serious, good girl, but then my parents just took it to the extreme, you know?</p><p>Even though it’s my birthday, they didn’t give me anything. I wondered why, so I asked them</p><p>And they answered, ‘You didn’t say anything so we thought you didn’t want anything’!</p><p>Isn’t that ridiculous? That really ticked me off! I’m so <em>so</em> angry right now!</p><p>So I ran away. I didn’t do anything wrong, right?</p><p>Then let me stay. I won’t be going home for a while.</p><p>Eh, what? The phone? Didn’t you listen to what I said, Onii-san?</p><p>Wait, actually, don’t tell me everything I said got heard to the other end of the line…?</p><p>Eeh, you’re telling me to take the phone? H-Hello?</p><p>What, it’s you, Onii-chan! What’s up? What about Dad and Mom?</p><p>They got worried for me and are searching everywhere right now…? Hmph, it’s too late to act like proper parents!</p><p>I’m furious, okay? You can play the ‘good kid’ in that house if you want, Onii-chan!</p><p>…Y-Yeah. Well, I see. So they <em>were</em> trying to celebrate my birthday?</p><p>Uwaah, don’t eat all the cake! Leave my share too!</p><p>I know, I used to be really selfish… I would go really crazy when they didn’t do as I said…</p><p>I guess it’s not so strange they ended up thinking I didn’t want anything, since I didn’t say a thing to them.</p><p>Got it. I’ll speak with Dad and Mom.</p><p>I should’ve talked it out with them since the beginning. I was in the wrong, too.</p><p>If Dad and Mom are looking all over for me, then it’s perfect.</p><p>Tell them to drop by somewhere on the way and buy me a present, will you?</p><p>I want a hamster! Yeah, I want a pet!</p><p>You know, I’ve been really friendly with animals living in the underground tunnels and the school barn, lately!</p><p>I’ve been thinking about raising a pet at home, too.</p><p>I’ll leave it to you, Nii-chan! Bye bye! I’ll be home soon.</p><p>Ihihi~…</p><p>Ah, yeah! I’ve made up with them! Or rather, my brother’s gonna eat all the cake if I don’t go home now!</p><p>I’m going back home now! I’m sorry to bother you two!</p><p>Uhya!? Onii-san, why are you carrying me on your shoulders? You’re going to take me home?</p><p>Oninee-san will go get the car and drive me home, so you’ll be carrying me until the parking lot? Wow, so she has a driving license?</p><p>Aww, what a thorough service! I’m happy!</p><p>If I can’t make up with my parents in the end and run away again, at that time I wanna become a child of this family!”</p>]]></content>

Memories.</p></div><p>Despite the title, the story doesn’t have anything to do with anyone’s underpants.</p><p>While waiting for Himeno doing class duty, Azusa fell asleep and saw a nostalgic dream, of a memory from two years in the past. Short story telling what happened the evening after the events of “Door to Paradise”.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="once-upon-a-pants">Once Upon a Pants</h2><h3 id="part-1">Part 1</h3><p><strong>&gt; Classroom</strong></p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> “Azusa-chaaan~♪</p><p>I’m done with class duty! Sorry to keep you waiting…</p><p>As promised, since we don’t have club today let’s drop by somew… huh?”</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “… ♪”</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> “Azusa-chan fell asleep.</p><p>I guess I kept her waiting too long.

Guys, she’s alive, right? S-She’s not dead, is she…?</p><p>W-W-W-What should we do?</p><p>She seems like a frail girl — what if she had a heart attack from all the racket?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “As if. Use your head a bit and you can tell she’s not dead.</p><p>Aah~ All this sodium, just the stuff for a tired body! ♪</p><p>And sugar, too. My brain cells and body are coming back to life!</p><p>So girls, what kind of festivities should we be spreading next? Ahahahaha! ☆”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Isn’t it enough already…?</p><p>Let’s keep a low profile for a bit! I think we’ve caught the bad sort of attention from the student council <em>and</em> the teachers…</p><p>If we stay like this — forget getting suspended, we’re all going to get kicked out of school!</p><p>Aah, God, forgive me! Your child has strayed from the path!”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Suck it with your praying, what the hell has your God ever done for us?</p><p>Argh, you piss me off. Why don’t I suck those annoying bangs of yours with this straw, huh!?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Stop that~ Auau…</p><p>W-Why does Konan-san keep bullying people in ways no one would normally think of?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “This ain’t bullying! It’s a show of real fresh inspiration, so unique the mass can’t catch up on it!</p><p>Let us overcome the criticisms and open the path to a new era! Suck, suck~ ☆”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Stop it! Don’t play with my hair~!</p><p>Ya-Yakumo-san! Do something about your friend! I’ve had enough of this troublemaker already!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Hwe? But Yako-chan’s bullying’s supposed to be her idea of bonding, maaybe. She doesn’t know any other way to display her affection.</p><p>She’s bad at expressing herself, but don’t hate her if you can, please? ♪”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Chizuru, if you’re not eating the buns, give them to me. I get easily hungry lately. But that’s just proof I’m alive, right?</p><p>Man, I feel so great right now! Ahahahaha! ☆”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Pants? Yako-chan, panties aren’t food, you know?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “No one is talking about anyone’s panties, I’m talking about buns, the bread for burgers…</p><p>Huh, wait. You guys don’t call it that in Japan<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Dunno. Chizuru’s an idiot, after all~♪”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “Hey, you. Stop abandoning all effort to think by claiming yourself as an idiot!</p><p>If you’re really an idiot, then make an effort to <em>think</em> to make up for the idiot you are! Idiots are always the ones to reform the world!”</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “… hyawa?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Ah, we woke her up.</p><p>Geez, it’s because you were so loud, you know, Yako-chan? And she was sleeping so nicely, too.</p><p>Good morning, umm… what’s your name, again? Can you introduce yourself to big sis?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “<em>You</em>, a <em>big sis</em>, Chizuru? Haven’t heard a better joke!”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “<em>Azunyan</em>-chan, was it? Are you okay? I’m sorry, we involved you in something weird…</p><p>You were sleeping so soundly, but do you remember what happened? Are you hurt anywhere?”</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “Umm… umm? H-Huh! So it wasn’t a dream?”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “It wasn’t. We’ve shaken off our pursuers, and now we’re resting at a burger joint while having a little late dinner.</p><p>If there’s anything you want to eat, just say. We’ll order it for you.</p><p>Ah, of course it’s on us, so don’t worry.”</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “No, umm!

U-Umm, what do you mean…?</p><p>Azusa feels like she’s gotten her neck in something dangerous!”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “You idiot, don’t get cold feet just from sticking your neck.

    <title>✿ ANV | Of A Flower Without Name</title>
    <url>/2019/eg-anv/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<div class="note info"><p>One of the short stories put up on Ensemble Girls’s 7th Anniversary website (<a href="https://cacalia.jp/special/kimisaki_7th/stories/akira/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>).</p></div><p>About one unnamed flower and one girl who taught it how to bloom (also four chaos factors). Ensemble Girls, again making you doubt the meaning of “service discontinuation”… Happy 7th Anniversary!</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="of-a-flower-without-name">Of A Flower Without Name</h2><p><strong>Written by: Akira</strong></p><p>“Transfer student-chan!”</p><p>That’s what they call me.</p><p>Due to my parent’s work──<br>I’ve had to transfer schools many times, and it’s made me more used to being addressed this way over my own name. Plus, being called by a label or a nickname feels more suited to me than by my real name, which I’m not really living up to.</p><p>It’s a touch lonely.</p><p>But I gulp down my discomfort as always and put on my best smile.</p><p>“What is it, Rei…”</p><p>“Gyuuuuu♪”</p><p>She pounces on me before I can fully say her name. Warm and soft, like a futon washed in sunlight. Being more petite than my peers, I always feel as if I’ve jumped into the sun each time she hugs me.</p><p>It’s not unpleasant in the least.</p><p>But it still. Feels. Like. I’m <em>dying</em>.</p><p>“Reika-chan──”</p><p>“Oh my, please don’t call me that in public? Walls have ears. Shall I remind you that people have started a trend of calling me by an idiotic title like <em>Her Majesty</em> these days, Transfer student-chan?”</p><p>While squishing me in her arms and nuzzling her cheek against me, she──<br>The student council president, Enjouji Reika-chan, smiles. In Kimisaki Academy, my new school, there isn’t a soul who doesn’t know of her.</p><p>She has long golden hair that seems as if woven purely from flower nectar selected and gathered with most prudency, rolling down her back in waves. Dozens of ribbons adorn it, like a flock of butterflies. She has a healthy, fine figure and spotless skin possible only for someone raised with as much love as she had.</p><p>She’s <em>beautiful.</em></p><p>There isn’t a day where I see her and don’t think so. With each glance, she reminds me and captivates me all over again. A peasant like me would’ve never met her under normal circumstances – she’s a princess straight out of a picture book.</p><p>For whatever reason, residents of Kimisaki Academy instead name her a “Queen”.</p><p>“Don’t you agree that it’s idiotic? The whole <em>Her Highness, Princess</em> thing was absurd enough, like we’re all part of some pretend play, but getting ranked up to Queen status is even more perplexing.”</p><p>Reika-chan has a majestic air about her when she’s quiet, but she talks a <em>lot</em>. She keeps talking even if you ignore her. But you can partly blame that on our age; after all, we are high school girls blooming.</p><p>“But you know? I think absurdity is necessary sometimes, Transfer student-chan. Because it gives a sense of approachability, and if I were to be called Princess or Queen, then I’d want to be a ruler loved by many.”</p><p>“What…? Okay then, to what do I owe the pleasure, Your Majesty?”</p><p>“Ahh! I get it, stop! Forget everything I said! I can’t stand the thought of you of all people getting all subservient on me like that! Sweet little birdie, please say my name tenderly like when we first met! Stop that polite tone, too─you sounded so distant!”</p><p>Reika-chan shouts intensely, flailing around; each movement yanks me with her, whisking my feet off the floor. A girl like a typhoon, as always.</p><p>I, being an ordinary person dragged into her force, have to give my all hanging on for my dear life.</p><p>Not that I hate it ─ not in the least.</p><p>“Fufu.”</p><p>In fact, the comfort of her arms nearly lulls me to sleep; to this sight, Reika-chan caresses my cheek with a satisfied giggle.</p><p>However, her face clouds over in an instant.</p><p>It’s unnerving, as if a dark cloud has literally veiled the sun.</p><p>“Is something bothering you?” I ask casually, following her wish to drop the formality, and well, we <em>are</em> the same age anyway. Reika-chan is big, more like a gentle big sister than anything, so I don’t feel like her equal.</p><p>But this is what she wants from me.</p><p>She was the one who approached me when I didn’t know left from right, and whatever it is about me that has pleased her so much, she’s been treating me very kindly since. I feel indebted to her.</p><p>Kimisaki Academy is a bit abnormal, compared to the many other schools I’ve been part of. The students seem obsessed with studying, constantly on edge… I’m not settling in very well.</p><p>But only Reika-chan is always warm.</p><p>I’m a girl of little value, like a weedy plant no one knows the name of.</p><p>But weeds flower too, and even if only for as brief as the glance you spare it ─ it has the power to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.</p><p>Besides, even if nobody else is, the sun is definitely looking.</p><p>If it manages to make somebody smile however briefly, then a wildflower has value.</p><hr><p>After that──</p><p>I roam the still unfamiliar grounds of Kimisaki Academy.</p><p>I got Reika-chan to disclose her problem a bit despite her persistent frown (she’s a fiercely simple girl, so she’s terrible with secrets), and as it turns out, she seems to have lost a certain item.</p><p>An important, red… <em>something</em>, that she unknowingly dropped somewhere.</p><p>As for what this something is, Reika-chan was being strangely shy about it, skirting around the question. But I got the hints I need, I have free time, so I thought I’d repay her for what she’s done for me.</p><p>I’m looking. By myself. For no particular reason.</p><p>It’s afterschool. Being the new transfer student, I haven’t joined any clubs, so I always either go straight home or aid Reika-chan through her busy president duties like a handmaid… But I’m not actually part of the student council.</p><p>Stuco people don’t like seeing a new kid like me hogging the attention of Her Majesty the Queen ─ I could feel it with my skin. So it’s a bit uncomfy, showing up there.</p><p>I’m not that shameless.</p><p>Over my many transfers, I’ve learned how to read the mood.</p><p>Don’t make waves. Infer what others are feeling. Walk near the corner.</p><p>This way of life isn’t fun by any measure, but it’s peaceful.</p><p>I’m going to be transferring again sooner or later, anyway.</p><p>Speading my roots deep will just make uprooting all the harder when it comes.</p><p>All the more miserable.</p><p>“… …”</p><p>Everything feels so pointless all of a sudden, and I stop dead in my tracks.</p><p>“Aahh──”</p><p>A mumble escapes me.</p><p>“Isn’t there anything fun──”</p><p>“Oh, damn it! Isn’t there anything <em>not</em> fun with life!? <em>Ahahaha</em>!☆”</p><p>Suddenly──<br>With enough force to knock my gloom-ridden monologue over, blow it away and more, someone’s delightful cackles shake the air.</p><hr><p>I start to fidget.</p><p>I mean, nobody’s around. Kimisaki Academy is very study-oriented, with immensely rigid traditions, so clubs aren’t very alive and students go home as soon as classes are over.</p><p>Or not home; to cram school, most likely.</p><p>It’s been nearly an hour since my search for Reika-chan’s lost red thing begun, so the school grounds are barren of even students leaving. I’ve been spacing out next to our squeaky clean schoolhouse (apparently just newly constructed after abandoning the old one) and I don’t see anyone in the vicinity.</p><p><em>But</em>. But even though I can’t spot a single soul, I can hear voices.</p><p>Boisterous, chatty voices of several young girls──</p><p>“Hey, look! Attention~! Didn’t you hear me say look or are you blind!? Damnit, Kuro, it’s cuz you’re covering your eye with your bangs like some emo kid that you can’t see! Cut that ugly fur already! Shave it bald! Maybe you’re gonna see the light then! Ahahahahaha☆”</p><p>“Gyaaaa~! Stooop~! Ya-Ya-Ya-Ya-Yakumo-san, do something about this troublemaker! Put that cursed hair clipper away, you she-devil! Stop, I like this haircut! It looks cute at this length!”</p><p>“Nfufu, you’d look cute in any hairstyle maaybe, Kuromori-chan♪ C’mon, Yako-chan! Hair is a girl’s soul! In other words, what you’re currently doing is a <em>murder attempt</em>! Surrender yourself!”</p><p>“What’re you playing at? You an idiot? Oh, of course you’re an idiot, you’re Chizuru!”</p><p>“Yup, yup, the thesaurus has Chizuru as a synonym for idiot, maaybe!”</p><p>“Haah!? Didn’t I tell you not to call yourself an idiot and abandon critical thinking!? Wanna go!?”</p><p>“Ehh, <em>you</em> said it first, Yako-chan, not me! You’re not making sense!”</p><p>“So what!? Humans <em>never</em> make sense! I don’t care who – even you’ll do, Chizuru – just let me cut your hair! My hair clipper is thirsting for <em>blood</em>!”</p><p>“Gyaaa! Stop swinging it around, you <em>psycho</em>! Why are you carrying a hair clipper around anyway? And I’m seriously wondering – does it work without electricity?”</p><p>“Doesn’t matter – I’ll make it work with willpower! My spirits will be its battery!”</p><p>“So it runs on battery~!? This is madness~ Stop, please, not my hair! If you cut my bangs any shorter, I’m gonna die from embarrassment!”</p><p>“Nyufufu. Sorry about her, Kuromori-chan. Yako-chan has terrible home life, so she gets anxious when no one is paying attention to her! She’s just an <em>adorable</em> attention seeker like that. Won’t you be patient with her?”</p><p>“That does it, don’t you move, Chizuru! I’m gonna start with shaving the skin off your face! Your grating pink hair’s gonna be drenched in blood ─ I’ll give you a full makeover the world will envy!”</p><p>“Eeh~? But you know, instead of being the envy of many, I’d rather be loved by my one destined prince…♪”</p><p>“Is the inside of your head pink too~!?”</p><hr><p>… …</p><p>…What’s happening?</p><p>On and on, I can hear some squabbling that makes you doubt the sanity of those involved going on and on (it sounds fun, though). Hmm, but I still don’t see anybody──</p><p>Are these voices echoed from somewhere else?</p><p>Wait.</p><p>I crouch down and put my ear to the ground. I think the girls’ voices are coming from below… or am I just imagining it?</p><p>I hope this means it’s not a ghost thing though.</p><p>I can’t deal with ghosts. I’m a scaredy cat; I have guts the size of a flea to go with my equally tiny body.</p><p>“…Come again?”</p><p>The conversation coming from (probably) underground is still ongoing.</p><p>“Ahh, okay… You should speak more clearly, seriously; it’s hard to pick up what you say. Yeah, yeah─I didn’t just shout ‘Attention~!’ for no reason, y’know? I’m not that hungry for attention.”</p><p>“No, you <em>are</em> hungry for attention.”</p><p>“Yup, yup! The thesaurus has Yako-chan as a synonym for attention-hungry, maaybe ♪”</p><p>“Throw away your shitty thesaurus already! It’s pissing me off!”</p><p>“I have to throw away an imaginary thesaurus now? You always ask the impossible, Yako-chan─fuhya!? Geez, don’t whisper in my ear! It tickles ♪”</p><p>“I wish I were you, Yakumo-san──”</p><p>“Whoa, not sure why, but Kuromori-chan’s staring at me with envy… Okay, apparently, she wants an explanation since she can’t see where our talk is going? But also, it’s fun chatting with us like this, she says!”</p><p>“Why are you interpreting for her, Chizuru.”</p><p>“Ehehe, I’m pretty happy with the whispering! Makes us feel like besties, maaybe ♪ Yako-chan, Kuromori-chan, there’s no time like now if you wanna join our whisper game of love!”</p><p>“Pass. I don’t get the point of whispering into anyone’s ears when we’re close enough to hear each other normally. You two got insects eating your brains or something?”</p><p>“Geez, can’t you summon your inner romantic for once, Yako-chan?”</p><p>“Shut up. …Well, alright, we may be getting a bit air deprived down here, so I’ll cut to the chase. Y’see… I just found this.”</p><p>“? What’s that? Your panties, Yako-chan?”</p><p>“How does this even look like underwear to you? Is it your vision or your brain that’s dim?”</p><p>“I just can’t make heads or tails of it, okay… What is it?”</p><p>“Honestly, I haven’t got a clue myself. I decided from the start that I’d bring you guys to explore the underground tunnels today, but since I couldn’t wait, I came in the morning and explored on my own──”</p><p>“Ah, no fair! You stole a march on us, Yako-chan! Rat her out, rat her out! Let’s rat her out to Ahura Mazda!”</p><p>“Is there a reason you’re bringing up Zoroaster’s highest deity? Just feeling innovative?”</p><p>“You two are knowledgeable about the weirdest things, you know that… As for me, I never wanted to explore any strange tunnels, so you could’ve gone on your own for all I care.”</p><p>“Haah? You’re saying you’re not having the time of your life right now!? I’m gonna make you cry!”</p><p>“Eeek, stop threatening me over every little thing, you hooligan! Punk! Troublemaker!”</p><p>“You got that right. And you’re together with me in the troublemaker camp now.”</p><p>“So I am… Uukh, how did I let this happen?”</p><p>“Shut it with the whining. Anyway~ so the tunnel turned out to be connected to the school courtyard. When I got there I spotted, quote-unquote, <em>Her Majesty the Queen</em> having lunch.”</p><p>“Ah, Enjouji-san strolls around outside by herself once in a while, doesn’t she?”</p><p>“Hah! I bet she’s feeling suffocated with her clique shadowing her everywhere. Moving on, she’s got this weirdly happy look staring at this weird red thing──”</p><p>At the mention of this, my silence so far is broken. “Red thing?”</p><p>… …</p><p>“…Did you hear that?”</p><p>“Omigosh, is there somebody aboveground? S-Shouldn’t we run for it~?”</p><p>“What’s to run from? Tell me, are we doing something bad? No, we’re not.”</p><p>“Hmm. No, but we <em>are</em> doing something suspicious ♪”</p><p>“Hmph. Forget that; I hate leaving things halfway, so I’m gonna tell my story all the way through. So, Enjouji was staring at this red thing fondly. I bet it’s like, a family memento. So I snuck out of the tunnel and stole it.”</p><p>“A-A villain~! Theft is a crime, you know, Konan-san!? Aah, God, Father, Mother, please forgive me─by some fate, Suzu has allowed herself to become an associate of evil!”</p><p>“I-It’s okay, Kuromori-chan. If we return it and show how sorry we are, God and Enjouji-san will forgive us. Hopefully.”</p><p>“Ehh~… after all the trouble I went through to steal it? Why don’t we use this to blackmail her and defeat her once and for all? It seems important to her.”</p><p>“T-That’s exactly why we should return it! See, Yakumo-san agrees with me, right? Anzu-chan too──”</p><p>While keeping an ear sharp to the squabble underground, I consider my options──</p><p>Until I hear someone’s lively footsteps approaching.</p><hr><p>“──Transfer student-chan!”</p><p>I jolt up from surprise and find a panting Reika-chan running up to me.</p><p>“Are you all right? I saw you crouching from the window; are you feeling ill? Please!”</p><p>“No, I──mugyu!?”</p><p>I get flustered, not knowing how to explain, when she pulls me into a hug as if it was the natural thing to do.</p><p>Seemingly warmed from the running, Reika-chan’s skin against me feels so much hotter than usual.</p><p>And I can hear her heart pounding louder against her chest.</p><p>Ah, she’s worried for me…</p><p>The thought just fills me with so much warmth that I find myself hugging her back for once.</p><p>“Whoa? W-What’s the matter? Are you in a spoiled mood, perhaps?”</p><p>Reika-chan stirs shyly, eyes wide in surprise.</p><p>“Say, is that voice──”</p><p>“Shit, it’s her! Her Majesty the Queen! If she finds us, it’s off with our heads! We’ve gotta scram! C’mon, you all, follow me!”</p><p>“There’s not going to be any beheading involved maaybe… We’re not in a Warring States period. You always make too big a deal of things, Yako-chan. You’re Princess Big Deal from Planet Big Deal.”</p><p>“Still, I think we’ll get an earful if we’re caught. No thanks to <em>a certain thief</em> stealing Enjouji-san’s treasure, that is. …whoa──wanya?”</p><p>The commotion building up underground ceases instantly.</p><p>At the same time, the ground right beneath me puffs up──and bursts open.</p><p>“Hya!?”</p><p>Reika-chan stiffens, pulling me to her with more strength as if to protect me. Because of this, she covers most of my field of vision─and I can’t see very clearly, but…</p><p>Like a seed budding into a flower, splitting open the earth, a girl’s face bobs up.</p><p>She has a vaguely indistinct feel to her, like I might have <em>or</em> might not have seen her before. Who is she again?──I’ve only just transferred, so I can’t identify that many of my schoolmates just yet.</p><p>“Anzu-chan!?”</p><p>Someone shouts from underground.</p><p>“What are you doing!? Geez, you’re always so spontaneous!”</p><p>At those words, the girl in front of me──<br>The girl apparently named Anzu-chan furrows her brows apologetically once, before reaching her hand out.</p><p>Towards <em>me</em>.</p><p>A red─what is that?─cloth of sort hangs from her hand.</p><p>Her extended hand seems as if wanting a handshake, so I hold out mine reflexively in answer.</p><p>Our hands touch.</p><p>With a soft grunt and a small animal-like nod, she passes the red cloth to my hand.</p><p>“Angie! What the hell are you doing, idiot!? Run!”</p><p>Several hands stretch out from behind Anzu-chan and gently clutch at various parts of her body, pulling her away. In an instant, the mysterious girl vanishes underground.</p><p>Their too loud voices and footsteps echo on and on──until they eventually fade to the distance.</p><hr><p>“Umm…?”</p><p>Apparently, Reika-chan couldn’t see anything from where she was facing. She warily turns around once the events passed, tilting her head inquisitively when noticing the hole made on the ground.</p><p>“I wonder what was that about? I only heard strange voices, but──oh my?”</p><p>Surprised, Reika-chan fixes her gaze on the red cloth on my hand.</p><p>“Why do you have that?”</p><p>“Oh, umm──”</p><p>I’m too befuddled to form a coherent answer. But clever Reika-chan softens into an understanding expression, pulling me into an even tighter hug.</p><p>“Thank you. You found it for me, didn’t you, knowing how much it means to me? I’m happy, very much so. You’re such a sweet girl.”</p><p>Seemingly overcame with emotion, Reika-chan’s arms tighten around me even more, as if to absorb me into her flesh. It’s closer to pro-wrestling than a hug at this point.</p><p>I’m <em>dying</em>.</p><p>Still──I just can never find this unpleasant in the least.</p><p>“Oh my, forgive me. You must find it hard to speak with me suffocating you.”</p><p>Reika-chan smiles and separates from me a bit.</p><p>“You see──” She rests her gaze at the red thing on my hand, her cheeks pink. “My older brothers gave it to me as a gift. It’s a ribbon. It doesn’t go with my hair color, unfortunately, so I struggled to make use of it.”</p><p>Ribbon. She’s right, I can’t unsee it now.</p><p>So this unidentifiable piece of cloth was a flower petal meant to adorn this dazzling girl.</p><p>“And then I thought of what a lovely match it would be for your beautiful black hair, so I brought it, to give it to you. It was a pity when I lost it, but I’m glad it has found its way to you.”</p><p>“For me──”</p><p>This was a present for <em>me</em>?</p><p>“Why…?”</p><p>I’m ecstatic, but my confusion goes above it, that I fail to bite back my skeptical question.</p><p>“Why… are you so nice to me, Reika-chan?”</p><p>“My, a tasteless question, don’t you think? But──I find that side of you to be <em>very well</em> ♪”</p><p>Again, she seems pleased by something about me I can’t figure out, and cradles me in her arms for the hundredth time.</p><p>“Why, you see, <em>Himari</em>…” calling me by name, Reika-chan murmurs, “For a flower to be beautiful and for I to want to cherish that flower, does there need to be a reason?”</p><p>Easily removing the red ribbon from my hand, she gently holds it up to my hair. But for some reason, her face crumples, and the next moment, she lets out a chortle.</p><p>“I’m sorry! I didn’t think it would end up not suiting you! It’s getting in the way of your lovely hair, actually. What shall I do? I didn’t expect this!” she exclaims, in that self-centered way of hers that only makes her all the more endearing.</p><p>Reika-chan wraps the red ribbon around my arm.</p><p>“Yes, I see it now. This is the correct place. I will make it into an armband; I’m not very good with a needle, but perhaps I can trouble Yomo to teach me.”</p><p>She ties it respectfully, like part of a ceremony.</p><p>“Yes! It suits you very well, Himari.”</p><p>She looks <em>so</em> satisfied with herself as she says this, and just like that, nothing seems to matter anymore. In a good way.</p><p>It’s all so ridiculous I can’t help a smile from spreading.</p><p>“Oh my──”</p><p>Seeing me, Reika-chan bursts into childlike laughter.</p><p>“The flower blossomed. This is what I wanted to see.”</p><p>… I’d like to see that flower, too.</p><p>Because Reika-chan seems so happy…</p><p>And in so much bliss.</p><hr><p>I seek that flower to this day.</p><p>I can’t see my own face unless I look in the mirror, so I decided to try make flowers bloom on the people around me instead.</p><p>Life is long, and youth is but a moment of it.</p><p>But even if only for that short moment, I want everyone to know what it’s like, to be a beautiful, blooming flower giving and receiving love.</p><p>Because I was happy.</p><p>That somebody would find and love me, a wildflower no one had ever looked back on.</p><p>I want to do the same thing for someone else.</p><p>If there’s a flower nobody knows the name of, then I’d like to be the first to discover and love it. Just as she had done for me.</p><p>Let’s take an overflowing amount of sunlight, nutrient, and water to satisfy the cold, dry lands of Kimisaki Academy. Let’s make this whole world into a field of flowers, where countless laughter resound loud.</p><p>It’s been my dream since that day.</p><p>That day.</p><p>When I was but a high school student…</p><p>I, Tsurumi Himari, learned how to make flowers bloom.</p>]]></content>

I don’t really wanna do this, but I will 'cause it’s work.</p><p>Let me introduce the special lecturer we have invited for today’s class.</p><p>The living legend of the idol industry, Hidaka Seiya-sensei. Please welcome him with a warm round of applause. Clap, clap, clap.&quot;</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/ALh5W5t.jpg"></p><p><strong>Seiya:</strong> &quot;Hello, everybody. Good day. Thank you for the welcome – I’m Hocchan’s dad.</p><p>My son has been in your care.&quot;</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/gzsO2I5.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Whoa!? W-What do we do, Akehoshi-kun… Hidaka-kun is making a face like he’s seeing the killer of his parent!?”</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/pss35T7.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Except that’s supposed to <em>be</em> his parent… Everything okay, Hokke? You look white as sheet!</p><p>If you’re really not up for this, how about we ditch? I’ll take you to my recommended ditching spots☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…that’s not necessary. I’m a serious honor student, the representative of this class. I will <em>never</em> ditch class. I won’t run away in the face of an enemy, even if it kills me.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “What enemy… Isn’t that your dad?”</p><p><strong>Seiya:</strong> “~…♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Ah, he waved!</p><p>Yay, yay, Hokke Papa! Remember me? Thank you veeeery much for Autumn Live and SS☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Seiya:</strong> &quot;Oh, don’t mind it. In fact, I’m the one who should thank you, Subaru-kun. You’ve been such a good friend to my son…</p><p>Of course, this also goes for Yuuki Makoto-kun next to you, and the rest of the students of this class.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> (Oh? He has me naturally memorized – even though we’ve never met face to face!</p><p>Rumor has it that he’s the busiest idol in the whole industry, so where in his mind does he have the room to keep track of such little details…?)</p><p><strong>Seiya:</strong> &quot;Fufu. I’m sure my pubescent son is very difficult to deal with.</p><p>I’m sorry for his attitude. My wife and I are both busy people, so we never have much time to attend to household matters; that must’ve been what caused my son to grow into such a cynic.</p><p>Yet, when he was little, he would run up to me as soon as I got home, pestering ‘papa’ to hold him.</p><p>Ah, would you like to see the photo? I happen to carry a laminated copy with me at all times…&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Wow, yay! I wanna see, I wanna see! Hokke as an innocent little kid~♪”</p><p><strong>Seiya:</strong> “I’m sorry. I lied about always carrying it with me.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “<em>Why</em>!?”</p><p><strong>Seiya:</strong> &quot;–but that’s also a lie, because I <em>do</em> have a digital copy on my smartphone. See? I have so many…</p><p>I personally find beauty in things that fade without a trace, like snow that thaws,</p><p>but my wife <em>loves</em> this kind of thing. She likes to send me these pictures that make me think, ‘when did you even take this!?’</p><p>And including that side to her, I love my wife with my whole heart.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Wow, so passionate~♪ What lovebirds!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Still, the way he lets us down and raises us up with lie after lie! Is this the high-grade technique of a legendary idol…!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yep, he really plays around with you, huh~? That side of him’s just like Hokke♪”</p><p><strong>Seiya:</strong> &quot;Are we so alike? I’m glad to hear that.</p><p>Our appearances aside, I thought Mother – my wife’s mother, so my mother-in-law – had the strongest influence in shaping his personality, so…</p><p>Thank you, Mother. My son couldn’t have grown so splendidly if you hadn’t been there for him. Please continue to watch over us from heaven.&quot;</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “My grandma isn’t dead! I won’t forgive such jokes! That’s enough; I’m killing him!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;C-Calm down, Hidaka-kun! Where did your usual cool go off to!?’</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t stop me, Yuuki! Don’t stop me! I beg you – that guy mustn’t be allowed to live!”</p><p><strong>Seiya:</strong> &quot;What cruel things you’re saying to your dad.</p><p>By the way, I got prior permission from Mother to make that inappropriate joke. Here’s a video I recorded as proof.&quot;</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Do you think I care whether you had her permission or not!? In this world, there are simply things that CAN and CANNOT BE SAAAID!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I’m telling you, calm down, Hidaka-kun!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “That’s right, Hokke! Follow me and take deep breaths! Hee-hee-hoo~! Hee-hee-hoo~!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Why Lamaze breathing!?”</p><p><strong>Seiya:</strong> “Fufu, nice. I’ll be using that joke. Let’s do it together when we get to co-star somewhere, Hocchan♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Who would do that!? What’s wrong with you!? Just go home! Disappear this instant! I can’t endure one second more of this living hell!”</p><p><strong>Seiya:</strong> &quot;Endure that much, at least. I wonder if we’ve spoiled you too much; my son has such little self-control and I’m worried for his future.</p><p>Well, anyway. Though I’ve been introduced, I think I’ll give a short greeting of my own.</p><p>We will be spending some time together in the same classroom, even if not for long… so I’m sure it’s necessary.</p><p>Hello, dear idol eggs.</p><p>I am here to give what little I can to help you hatch, so you may one day take flight with your resplendent wings.</p><p>I hope you will also do your best to follow in my footsteps, and become model prisoners of idol jail♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eh? Jail? Model prisoner…? I-Is that a joke too?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Sorry. My father has a habit of making inappropriate jokes that are hard to laugh at.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh~ That side is also just like Hokke♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What do you mean by that, Akehoshi!? My jokes are funny!”</p><p><strong>Seiya:</strong> &quot;Yes, of course. I’d like to begin my class, so please quiet down.</p><p>Ah, I sounded just like a teacher… After taking up a similar position, I think I see how fun your life might actually be, Jin-kun.&quot;</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> &quot;Don’t drag me into the talk, please. It looks so troublesome I just wanna stay out of it…</p><p>I’ll leave the rest to you, so please do the job well, <em>Hidaka-senpai</em>.&quot;</p><p><strong>Seiya:</strong> &quot;Certainly. Don’t worry; the word ‘impossible’ isn’t in my dictionary.</p><p>Neither is ‘divorce’, by the way. I’d rather destroy the earth than part from my beloved wife… it’d be easier, anyway.&quot;</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Stop boasting about your love life after every other sentence! That side of you is what I really can’t stand!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> (Ahaha. Hokke’s funnier than ever today. Even if I feel a bit sorry for him, getting played around with so much…</p><p>Still, I wonder why Hokke Papa is suddenly visiting our school as a special lecturer?</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/XTnbYiE.jpg"></p><p>I’m not sure, but… I’m a little envious that you get to squabble with your dad like that, Hokke♪)</p>]]></content>

You’re interrupting my lunch.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/h3VluWK.jpg"></p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Why are you having lunch here anyway? We can’t focus with you staring like that.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Hmph. I was a little worried, you see, if Sagami-sensei was practicing seriously like he should.</p><p>I just want to observe while taking lunch. I don’t intend to interfere, so don’t mind me.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nah, I <em>can’t</em> not mind with that aura of dissatisfaction seeping out of you.</p><p>…oh? Akiyan, is that a lunchbox packed with a wife’s love I see?</p><p>Gimme a bite. I’m running outta gas after all that working out… (<em>munch, munch</em>)♪”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Hey now! Stop picking at my lunch.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/YuVlCrX.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What are full-grown adults doing arguing like schoolgirls?</p><p>Stop skipping out, Sagami-sensei. Come back to the lesson.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Uukh~ You youngsters are so full of energy it’s blinding me. I can’t open my eyes.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t sleep. If you <em>do</em> want to rest, don’t just lie down without cooling down first; it’ll affect you tomorrow. You’re not young anymore, Sensei.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu. It must be hard on you, Hidaka-kun.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah, Kunugi-sensei – good day. Sorry for interrupting your meal; have you come to see how we’re doing?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Yes. While I can’t say I have that much free time myself, it’s been on my mind whether Sagami-sensei is taking this seriously like he should…</p><p>… not to mention the weird order the higher-ups just gave me.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Higher-ups? Weird order?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Don’t mind it. So far, it’s only been the delusional elderly letting their persecution complex get the better of them.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…? I’m not sure I understand. But since you’re here, can you tell us when you pick up anything weird about us while watching?</p><p>Sagami-sensei has his hands full just making sure he’s properly acting like an idol, so he hasn’t been giving us many directions.</p><p>I’m worried whether or not we’re doing this right; if we’re really fine like this.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “It’s fine, it’s fine! No problem at all! We’re steadily becoming a unit!</p><p>You feel the same, right Himemiya!? Is your youth burning with flames!?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/b2ZVw2o.jpg"></p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Stop bothering me every second…</p><p>Ahh geez, I’m so tired. <em>fine</em>’s lessons may be hard and taxing, but Rain-bows’ are such a mental drain.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Oh, Morisawa-kun, Himemiya-kun. Good work to the both of you.</p><p>I’m sorry, really, that you have to get dragged into us grown-ups’ troublesome affairs… It must be a lot of work, having to deal with Sagami-sensei?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “No, this is a chance like no other to me! I am savoring every moment of it, sir!</p><p>But it seems to be a little hard on Himemiya’s stamina. Are you okay? Take some rest when it gets too much.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Don’t make fun of me. It does get tough on days when I have <em>fine</em> work after school and Rain-bows practice for lunch break, since I get no chance to rest…</p><p>And I haven’t fully adapted to life at Yumenosaki yet.</p><p>But, President is actively supporting this plan.</p><p>And it doesn’t look like I can get away from you troublesome bunch even if I whine… so I’ll just have to find the resolve… no, I’ll just give in and do my best.</p><p>Ahh geez. Why did things end up like this…”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fuhaha! You’re such a hard worker, Himemiya! I will affirm you with every fiber of my being! There, there, there♪”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Umya!? Stop clinging to me, it’s stifling! Are you asking to get bitten!?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Ahaha. Surprisingly, you all seem to be getting along well.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. What happened in DDD put some distance between me and Himemiya, but…</p><p>Morisawa-senpai has been acting as the bridge to connect us all, which makes things peaceful.</p><p>That must be the skill of a leader. I have to learn from him.</p><p>…well, officially, the leader of Rain-bows is not Morisawa-senpai, but Sagami-sensei.</p><p>Hence – stop lazing around and get to work. What’s a leader who won’t set an example?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay, okay… We only have once a week, and only during lunch break, to gather.</p><p>There’s little time for anything, so we have to use what we have efficiently.</p><p>I know that. But this little old man’s dead tired. No idea how my younger self endured a life of this.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Didn’t you have an even more taxing schedule, as a youth?</p><p>You supported the whole industry on your own… Watching by your side, I admired you for how much of a superhuman feat it was.</p><p>But I never managed to imitate you, in the end.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Hmph. After realizing that making an individual shoulder everything will crush them under the weight, spreading the load between members of a unit has become the trend, right?</p><p>I wanna leave the hard work to the young’uns, seriously.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Goodness. To think you’d reach your limit so soon, Jin. Are you sure you will be fine, going forward?</p><p>…I suppose I should really stop acting like an observer and move onto the support. That’s what the higher-ups ordered, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Eh, what? Did I just hear you say something ominous, Akiyan?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “No. It’s my business – don’t mind it.”</p><h3 id="revival-8">Revival / 8</h3><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “All right, that’s enough for breaks! There’s no point to us moving forward without you, so please come back so we can do our best together, Sensei!”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/e4WdSHm.jpg"></p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Uukh~… I’m supposed to be the mentor, but I feel like I’m being enslaved by my disciples.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “If you want to be respected as a mentor so much, show us how you live up to the title.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No choice, eh… Gotta hang on for a little longer, I guess.</p><p>Alright, gather around, kids. I’ll tell you about our coming plans.</p><p>We’ve run over the standard lessons every week so far, and we’ve finally become somewhat watchable. I think. Probably. ”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s where you were supposed to say it with certainty to boost our confidence.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Boy, you ask for a lot… Anyway, we’re going nowhere just sticking to lessons.</p><p>With Project-Saga articles getting stale, Mr. Writer’s troubled and I’m getting lazier.</p><p>So. I’m thinking we should hold a live next month.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ohh, a live show! So it’s finally time for the world to see us Rain-bows…☆”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Uukh. I don’t want anyone to see. I want to bury away the reality that I’ve ever been involved with these people.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, I’m sure you guys have your own opinions. But you know that live shows are the most straightforward idol activity there is.</p><p>We only have the minimum war funds that were provided at our formation, but if we hold official DreamFests, we’ll be rewarded according to our results.</p><p>Though in our case, I guess we won’t have much to do with the money even if we get a lot.</p><p>But if we have a bigger budget, we won’t have to make do with the rooftop; we can rent official lesson rooms.</p><p>The quality of our lessons will increase, and so will our efficiency; we’ll get to produce more results even with our limited time.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm. That’s true; even with muscle training, they say your growth rate is higher when you use the newest facilities and equipment.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Speaking of which, why are we practicing on the rooftop? Isn’t this place restricted…? Is it okay?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Of course. Who do you think I am? I’m a teacher.</p><p>A teacher’s an exception, so on the condition that I keep you guys under my watch… I get the permission to rent out this place for our practice.</p><p>In fact, since it’s usually off-limits, nobody uses it.</p><p>And that means we won’t be bothering other units; it’s very convenient as our practice location.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Nn~ I like it, since the view is nice.</p><p>But the only reason we haven’t had problems is that we’ve had nothing but clear weather. Won’t it be really nasty if it rains?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yep. It won’t be for a while, but the rainy season will come.</p><p>I wanna gather enough money so we can take shelter right away when the weather isn’t on our side.</p><p>We can borrow an empty classroom for no fee,</p><p>but since it won’t be soundproof, we’ll be bothering other people, and the environment’s just not made for efficient practice.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I see. Live shows will help get us the funds needed to avoid that.</p><p>So an investment for the future. I expected no less, Sagami-sensei… always planning for the long run♪”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. We can gather an audience by holding a live, which means an increase of fans.</p><p>There’s not much point to Rain-bows gaining fans, but <em>you</em> guys gaining higher appraisal and popularity independently shouldn’t be a bad thing at all.</p><p>Your units will benefit from it too.</p><p>You don’t seem very willing, Himemiya – but I hope you can consider that your drive to continue working as Rain-bows.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Plus, it’s a national magazine that serializes Project-Saga.</p><p>Depending on how it works out, you could sell your name to a wider audience than just Yumenosaki Academy’s.</p><p>This should be especially relevant to Hidaka, who’s gonna compete in SS.</p><p>SS gathers fans from every nook of the country, so you’ll benefit from gaining even just a little more fame.</p><p>Since the magazine serializing Project-Saga doesn’t just cover idols, you’ll get to appeal to an audience who aren’t usually interested in them.</p><p>You don’t usually get to reach out to that demographic if you just do regular work…</p><p>So if you can sell your name there, you may get a step or two ahead of other idols.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. I’ve been thinking that we’ll need to lay the groundwork for SS.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right! Necessity is the father of success! When your goal is clear, it becomes a lot easier to move!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, we’re a temporary unit that came outta nowhere.</p><p>We don’t even have funds; calling over a bunch of audience for a showy live’s just a dream within a dream.</p><p>So don’t get your head in the clouds. What I just described are things that <em>may be</em> possible if things turn out well.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Hmph. Of course it’ll turn out well. <em>I’m</em> here.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s a lot of confidence. Well, I don’t have the slightest intention to fail either.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right! I’m getting psyched~! Our current goal is a live show! And the first move we should make to achieve that is… what could it be, Sagami-sensei!?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “You guys are beyond dependable. Good boys.</p><p>I can rest easy thanks to you. When it comes to to preparing for live shows, though, I’m sure you kids have more experience and knowledge than I do.</p><p>So specifically, what do you guys think we need to do from now on?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You’re so unreliable, <em>Mentor</em>. This is the part where you should boss us around with a multitude of orders.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “That’s not my character… and you’ve probably forgotten, but I’m a retiree, a relic of the past.</p><p>I think we’ll encounter less problems if I emulate <em>your</em> methods, as you kids are still active in the field.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “That’s true… Um, so you see, if we’re holding a live show, we’ll have to call in lots of audience first!</p><p>President’s very cooperative with Project-Saga for some reason, so he’ll probably promote us if I ask?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, we need to come up with a program first. There’s no point in gathering people if we have nothing to show.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah, deciding what we’ll perform will help in the promotion, I’m sure.</p><p>Still, we’re a temporary unit. We have no song repertoire to choose from.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right. I’m not sure about using Trickstar or Ryuuseitai’s – our original units’ – songs as they are.</p><p>Each unit has different kinds of tunes and dances to suit the group’s style and direction, after all.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Eh~? But I wanna sing <em>fine</em>’s songs!</p><p>More like, I haven’t even practiced <em>fine</em>’s songs perfectly, so even if you make a lot of new songs now, I’m not gonna remember all of them!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. Of course. Most of <em>fine</em>’s songs seem difficult.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I have an idea. What if we rearrange our existing unit songs to suit Rain-bows’s style?</p><p>Of course, we’ll need to get permission from our respective units first.</p><p>But it’s fastest and easiest to use the weapon we’re most used to, as a rule.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. So using rearranged versions of our existing songs as our main weapon while adding a few original songs on top of them… would be the safest strategy, I guess?”</p><h3 id="revival-9">Revival / 9</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Anyway. So what we need to hold a live show is: songs, choreography, and then… costumes?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/uangx3q.jpg"></p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right. We’ll start by putting together a program, see how it works out, and do some fine-tuning to find a balance. We have to bring out some sense of unity so we have a basis for designing the stage and costumes.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Oh. The transfer student’s eyes lit up. Do you want to make the costumes?</p><p>I have faith in your skills, and it’ll be cheaper than buying order-made, so we certainly appreciate it if you’re willing to make them…”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah. I thought about asking my close friend, Kiryuu, for the costumes like usual, but I’ll leave it to you if you’re up for it, Transfer Student.</p><p>Kiryuu said he’s been busy with the commissions heaping up lately, too.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/A4QKwaG.jpg"></p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Umm, you guys are moving along so rapidly that I dunno what to say… wait a minute.</p><p>Okay, so we have a solution for costumes – then the problem is where to get new songs?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I can ask my father’s acquaintance to compose a song.</p><p>They already helped out during the revolution though, so I kind of hesitate to ask again.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right. Well, at worst, we can use some of the cheap songs that are up for rent.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Rent… songs? There’s something like that?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “They don’t use them in <em>fine</em>? There’s a paid plan for borrowing songs to be used for lives or classes; I think it started sometime last year…</p><p>Not everybody can make a new song each time they hold a live, so they provide this convenient system.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Oh… I had no idea. It’s really like commoner culture, huh.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I was thinking – since Sagami-sensei is part of the team…</p><p>What if we use Sagami-sensei’s old hit songs, or rearrange them?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Aah, true, reviving old idols is what Project-Saga’s all about.</p><p>Having nostalgic songs may be nice; it’s important to have tunes that suit the project’s goal.</p><p>And if it’s Sagami-sensei’s hit songs – they’re my favorites to sing at karaoke, so I can perform them immediately.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Ah… Morisawa-senpai, do you like karaoke?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm? Do you like karaoke too, Himemiya? Ah, but that’s not possible; you’re a well-off young master, after all.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “No, I li… ne-never mind!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ Well, they may fit Project-Saga, but all my songs are pretty out of date if you listen to them now, y’know… are you guys sure?</p><p>Aren’t they lame and unbearable to hear, for modern kids?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “It’s okay, Sagami-sensei! Masterpieces transcend time…☆”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nngh, I personally don’t wanna drag you youngsters into us old men’s fondness for nostalgia…</p><p>But I’ll look into it; remaking famous old songs isn’t so rare in the music industry.</p><p>It’s just, even though they’re part of my repertoire, I don’t hold the copyrights.</p><p>Some songs may have difficult terms of use, or demand crazily high fees.</p><p>In case of these problems cropping up, we should look to composing new, modern songs like normal.</p><p>I’ve said this over and over, but Project-Saga’s a low-budget plan and we have no money.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Yeah, <em>that’s</em> the problem. We’re like paupers or something… But that’s why I wanna pull off the live and raise lots of funds.</p><p>I think I’m starting to get motivated. Being an idol really is all about performing in live shows.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “But that’s not the only thing constituting idol activity.</p><p>With promoting the live show, servicing the fans, being interviewed by Mr. Writer, and getting your pictures taken… you’ll get to have a full course of idol-like experience.</p><p>I pray that those experiences will turn out to be of use on your original paths.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Fufu. Actually, since in <em>fine</em>, I have my hands full just catching up to my seniors…</p><p>I think it <em>might</em> be pretty new and fun that I get to decide everything from square one with the team and do normal idol stuff like this.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah. I’m having fun too. I have no dissatisfaction towards Ryuuseitai, but it’s gotten further dyed in hero themes because of my hobby…</p><p>So I’m happy I get to act like a straightforward, normal idol; feels like if I’ve become a newbie all over again.</p><p>Actually, I’m kinda worried that I’ve gotten so set in my hero ways that I’ve lost the ability to act like an idol.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “We ran over the basic lessons so that wouldn’t happen, right?</p><p>… I also think it’s a happy thing, that I get to forget revolutions and personal enmities, and perform as an idol in my natural state.</p><p>An idol isn’t about defeating enemies or changing the world – it’s about singing and dancing to satisfy the audience in front of you.</p><p>I feel like I just got reminded of that very natural thing.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “You’re not supposed to forget it. It’s important, you hear me?</p><p>Nah… as long as you guys don’t forget, you will always be idols.</p><p>You can keep standing on stage, for as long as you’re sought for.</p><p>I’ve thrown away that right with my own hands, but I think if it’s you guys – you won’t end up like me.</p><p>… huh, wait? I just noticed Kunugi-sensei’s gone?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Huh? You’re right… But lunch break is gonna end soon, so he’s probably just done here?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ Seriously, what did he come here for…? Just to gawk?</p><p>Well, who cares. Lunch break <em>is</em> ending… so let’s pack up and disperse, guys.</p><p>Don’t be late to your classes; the other teachers will bawl me out if you do.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmph… Geez, just when I thought you said something pretty nice, you have to be like <em>that</em>.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahaha. But the little unfortunate sides to people are what exactly gives them a lovable, human touch, you don’t think? No?”</p><p><strong>&gt; Hallway, 2nd Floor</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Gg6g7m5.jpg"></p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “…Yes. Yes.</p><p>Right. I’m sorry we have to speak over the phone – Sagami-sensei may pick up on us if I summon you through a school-wide broadcast…</p><p>But if it’s necessary, we can meet up so I can explain in person.</p><p>Not necessary? That’s good. It’s quite troublesome to have to find you and speak to you directly.</p><p>Yes, as I’ve mentioned before, I’m thinking of getting involved in Project-Saga.</p><p>They’re too relaxed, too comfortable, with no sense of danger at all.</p><p>I believe they need a little <em>stimulation</em> from the outside.

No, an extra side story is probably the most this can be.

But I swear I haven’t done anythin’ wrong…”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I know. But even when you haven’t done anything bad, those who provide no benefit to the big picture are weeded out; that’s simply how it goes in the world of adults.</p><p>This isn’t compulsory education either, so they can’t afford to keep freeloaders around forever.</p><p>Kagehira-kun, you’ve been skipping classes to do part-time jobs, haven’t you? You are what society normally calls a delinquent.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “De-Delinquent? That’s not it, I just need to gather funds f’r Valkyrie…</p><p>I always try to attend classes too; even if I usually get too tired an’ end up sleepin’ through 'em.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Take the classes properly; at least study your tuition’s worth.</p><p>Consider the feelings of the teachers who have to drone on and on in front of sleeping children because they’re duty-bound to hold a lecture.</p><p>It isn’t only aggravating and saddening – it feels hollow after a while.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Uukh. I’m sorry… Th-That’s such a deserved reprimand I can’t argue back.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Well, you are still among the better ones, Kagehira-kun.</p><p>The bigger problem here is Mikejima-kun, who has probably broken about every school rule there is, and Harukawa-kun, who keeps doing bizarre things such as climbing the school walls.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha!

When scolded, apologizes!</p><p>But it doesn’t say anywhere in the school rules… that we must use the corridors and stairs during transit instead of climbing the walls, right~?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Well, you two certainly know how to argue back… Don’t misunderstand. I am not your enemy.</p><p>In fact, I am talking to you because I want to protect you and do something for you.</p><p>The three of you have some form of connection with that ‘Five Oddballs’ group, yes?</p><p>In the last quarter of last year, that name was another word for ‘troublemakers’. The academy doesn’t think well of them.</p><p>The idol trade is all about fame, and faith. It isn’t smart to let any source of bad reputation roam free.</p><p>Although the Five Oddballs are incredibly excellent idols, so the academy seems to be unwilling to let go of them either.</p><p>However, as people related to them, you may turn into targets of criticism and attack.</p><p>You do not want to cause problems for each of your important people, I believe? Then reflect on your actions and fix your behaviors.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Anyway. If you accept the part-time job I’m about to offer you, I promise to have your backs.</p><p>As long as you don’t cross the line, I can feign ignorance towards any of your problematic behaviors.</p><p>I am in charge of student guidance – so I can offer you my connivance, to some extent.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Oh, a backroom deal? What a bad, bad teacher you are; I don’t dislike that♪”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Eh, eh? What’s that mean? I still can’t follow!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. This is what Kunugi-sensei is saying… <em>if we lend him a hand, he’ll write off all of our problematic behaviors so far</em>.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I’m not writing them <em>off</em>. But well, I will be <em>lenient</em>.</p><p>I will also negotiate with the other teachers and convince them – no… I will become your ally.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “And you ask us to be your soldiers in exchange? Using someone’s weakness against them for your exploits – that’s what the mafia does, you knoow♪”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “It doesn’t sound like a joke coming from you, Mikejima-kun.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Nngaah~? I don’t really understand, but that smells like serious trouble! Wh-What are you gonna make us do… Kunugi-sensei?</p><p>I’ll hafta say no to gettin’ involved in crimes! I don’t want Oshi-san t’get a scratch on 'is record because of me!”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu. How could I involve my dearest students in criminal acts? I’m in the position where I must actively stop <em>you</em> when I catch you in one. Don’t make light of me.</p><p>Anyway, the content of this part-time job is easy. I need you to form a temporary unit.</p><p>The unit name will need to be thought through together, but I plan for us to use ready-made songs and costumes…</p><p>So hopefully, it won’t be too much of a workload for you.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Nnn, ‘temporary unit’? Not a word Sora’s heard~?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Right, first years would have no idea, I suppose… I will explain it to you later. However, this temporary unit will have to perform in a certain live show next month.</p><p>Until then, you are prohibited from taking other on-campus part-time jobs; you will devote yourselves to unit lessons.</p><p>Of course you don’t mind? You will have to take more idol-like jobs like this, instead of cleaning the rooms or doing laundry.</p><p>I will also pay you the money you probably would have gained had you spent that period doing part-time jobs.</p><p>And as I’ve mentioned, I will overlook your problematic behaviors, to some extent.</p><p>What do you think? This isn’t a bad deal at all, is it? Will you accept?”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Eeehh~ Honestly I don’t wanna be part o’ another unit besides Valkyrie… but based on the talk so far, I probably can’t refuse?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Why, yes. This isn’t a suggestion; it’s an order. You must obey your teacher, you see.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! [What arrogance]! It makes me want to resist for no reason, but there <em>does</em> seem to be no disadvantage to accepting?</p><p>Even if it doesn’t settle well with me to have my free will stolen away and dance to someone else’s tune.</p><p>I don’t mind agreeing. I was thinking to comply with the unit system and work in one <em>just</em> once, rather than just observing from the side.</p><p>Experience is the best teacher, right? I’m sure it won’t go to waste.</p><p>Know your enemy, know yourself, and you shall win a hundred battles. I was thinking to get a direct feel of the logic that currently governs this academy.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Nn~ Sora will be happy just being able to sing and dance while having fun, but can Sora confirm this with Shisho first?</p><p>Discussing with Shisho before making hard decisions has become Sora’s style lately~”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Yes, well, I don’t mind if you take it home with you and think it through first.</p><p>Just keep in mind that the live show is in a month; we don’t have much time to spare.</p><p>If you spend too much time thinking, we’ll lose the time we could’ve used on doing lessons, so I advise you to give me an answer as soon as possible.</p><p>Still… do give it proper thought before making the decision. I said it was an order, but the freedom to comply with it or not still lies with you.</p><p>I can force you… but this time, I won’t.</p><p>For the time being, this case doesn’t seem to demand such desperate measures. Not a do-or-die that will decide the direction of anyone’s life; nothing but a comparatively irrelevant, silly story.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “…”</p><h3 id="revival-12">Revival / 12</h3><p><strong>&gt; Rooftop</strong></p><p>&lt; Approximately a week later, Rain-bows’ activity day &gt;</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Bon appetit~☆</p><p>(<em>munch, munch, munch</em>) ♪ It’s delicious as always!

My Slave No.1 is Yuzuru, so she’s No.2.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m really not one to say, but be more respectful to your elders. And don’t speak while eating; it’s poor manners.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “You’re so fussy~ Stop sounding like Yuzuru.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Heh. Fushimi asked me to keep an eye on you, so it suits me perfectly that I ‘sound like Yuzuru’.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Gehh, don’t just be friends with my slave without permission… darnit, Yuzuru, this is a betrayal to <em>fine</em>.</p><p>Well, I don’t actually mind. Hidaka-senpai, you’re nowhere as noisy as Yuzuru.</p><p>I dunno what you’re holding back for, but you don’t meddle with me too much, so I don’t find you so grating.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…If you wish, I can be a lot harsher with you. I still don’t fully grasp how I should deal with my juniors; I’m not sure how much distance to keep.</p><p>But I wouldn’t mind constantly badgering and babysitting you around the clock, you know… <em>Princess?</em>”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Uehh? What the heck? Don’t give me weird titles!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “? Isn’t it your nickname? That’s what buchou said.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Buchou? Ah, that Long Hair?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. When I told him about Rain-bows during club, he told me ‘You must escort the Princess properly, Prince♪’ or something along those lines.</p><p>It seems buchou is also cheering us on.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Are you sure~? That sounds like he’s making fun of us. I still have no idea what goes on under that long hair of his.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I have no idea either. …but anyway, you can call me by a nickname too.</p><p>We’ve become comrades through some trick of fate; I’d prefer that you don’t keep up a hostile act because I’m an ‘enemy’ or ‘traitor’.</p><p>Also, I thought this after watching Akehoshi – calling each other by nicknames will make us seem like we get along really well. Isn’t it nice?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Is there any need to get along…? Well, small fry like Trickstar gotta stick together to survive, I guess.</p><p>But each of us has to stand independently as peerless, undefeated kings in _fine_♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Really? Last year, <em>fine</em> was the one making a show of behaving like weaklings sticking together… I guess the times have changed.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…? What? <em>fine</em> were always main characters of absolute justice, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Is that how it looks from the outside?

The junior duo over there, don’t just get along on your own. Let me in too.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Don’t group us weirdly like that. … you were discussing something difficult with Sagami-sensei, so we were giving you some space, you know?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right. Actually, he told me to explain it to you guys too, so let me have a word.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Morisawa-senpai, where’s Sagami-sensei? I only just noticed he’s gone. Can’t he even do explanations on his own… that slothful teacher?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Don’t say that. School teachers are busier than we imagine, you know.</p><p>He can’t deal with us all the time; just now he had to rush to the infirmary because an emergency patient came.</p><p>He said he’ll get us something nice while he’s away, so let’s wait expectantly. Seems like it has to do with the transfer student, who hasn’t shown up today.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “With the transfer student? Come to think of it, she’s not here today; I thought she was just busy producing other units.</p><p>The transfer student’s been focusing on some other work even during class lately… She’s visibly busy; it’s almost hard to call out to her.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm… Well, that girl is a hard worker.</p><p>Although the Produce Course is still on trial and she’s the only person there, jobs for producer just keep increasing.</p><p>At this rate, she’s going to reach her breaking point. As someone who’s usually by her side, you should watch out for her, Hidaka.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah, of course, naturally. But the transfer student’s not being forced to work, it’s what she wants to do—</p><p>So I’m not sure if I should stop her just because I’m worried she works too much.</p><p>Anyway. So what is it that you wanted to explain… Morisawa-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right. Well, let’s just relax and have lunch as we talk.</p><p>Sagami-sensei will come back eventually, possibly with the transfer student. I personally want all of Rain-bows gathered for our discussion.</p><p>Two is better than one, three is better than two, and everyone together is better than three.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Hmph. You guys can’t live without constantly herding together or something?</p><p>That’s okay, though. Rain-bows activities are mostly such a pain, but the mealtimes are pretty fun…</p><p>I have to stay sharp since the lessons are tougher than I thought – but that’s why the mealtime that comes after is my haven~♪</p><p>It’s my chance to slow down and breathe. Slave No.2 puts my favorite food in the lunchbox too.</p><p>And I don’t have to take ‘Yuzuru’s Table Manners Course’ every time.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Himemiya, do you always eat lunch with that kid… Fushimi? Sounds to me like you two are close buddies☆”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “We’re not… He’s just a servant who has worked at our place a long time; a guy I just can’t get rid of.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Really?

Who could’ve guessed?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fuhaha! But that’s why life is precious! Don’t you think so, guys!?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Wow, annoying… How are you constantly hyped like that? The Long Hair from my unit isn’t much different though.</p><p>You guys probably just have too much energy… then you could’ve shared some with me.</p><p>I’m so lacking in stamina that lately, I’ve started to lag behind <em>fine</em>’s lessons. …I don’t wanna be the thing that locks those people in place.</p><p>I didn’t come all the way here to become a burden.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Uh, Senpai? Why did you move your dessert jellies into my lunch box?</p><p>Sure, I was thinking the lunch needs more sweetness, but I’m <em>not</em> a beggar, okay!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, sweets are good for stress, you see.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “That’s right! Build your stamina by eating lots and lots! Promise me this☆”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “… I was wrong to assume these people would have any sense of tact or delicacy.

Welcome back!</p><p>Ohh, so you’re with him, Transfer Student! Good, good! We were lonely thinking you might not show up today! C’mere, come closer♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t beckon her like you would a cat. Pay her proper respect as an equal, a person.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Yeah, Morisawa-senpai can be like <em>that</em>, huh?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I don’t want to hear that from you guys… but I’m just not used to girls. I can’t figure out how to treat them.</p><p>Up until middle school, there were girls in my surroundings. But I didn’t interact with them much…</p><p>I liked playing baseball or the like with my guy friends more than playing with girls.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Huh. Isn’t that okay? … From where I stand, I think you’re blessed to be able to experience an ordinary life like that.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. We both keep asking for something we don’t have, huh?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Haha. You guys have really gotten friendly before I knew it. You forget your shackles so easily… I was like that as a brat too, I think.</p><p>Ah well. Transfer Student, give them <em>that thing</em>.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That thing? What do you mean?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ah, I’m sorry, Sagami-sensei. I got so into my chat with them that I didn’t get around to explaining.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Huh. Well, it’s fine; getting along is your first priority.</p><p>I’ll explain, then. The details of the live show that became our current goal have been mostly finalized. The proposal got officially approved, and they provided us plenty of funds.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Whoa, that’s nice. We’d been thinking so far ahead without sorting ourselves out in the present, I was a bit worried.</p><p>I thought in the worst case scenario, I might need to beg from the president or pay out of my own pocket.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm, you’re helping out of goodwill, Himemiya, so it wouldn’t feel good to burden you with that.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “What are you talking about? It’s enough burden having to give up my precious lunch break every week for this.</p><p>And you seem to forget, but I’m not helping out of goodwill or anything.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah… Right, you were supposed to be the spy the student council president sent.</p><p>Are things going okay? Are you properly giving him the reports he wants?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “The guy I’m spying on is worrying about me… This is such a weird situation.</p><p>I don’t know if President is satisfied, but I’ve been reporting to him on the same day Rain-bows gather.</p><p>Plus, President seems to be investigating from various directions himself, including checking out the magazine where Project-Saga is serialized.</p><p>He said he’s jealous since we seem to be having fun.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah. Surprisingly, this is really fun.</p><p>Since I’m not the leader like I’d be in Ryuuseitai, I think that’s allowed me to loosen up and perform more freely.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I feel the same. Leader, huh… I really don’t feel the position suits me.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “? Rain-bows’s leader is Sagami-sensei, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah no, I became Trickstar’s leader, you see. Just as a formality though; we’re all equal in the group, but…</p><p>My work and responsibility increased. I can’t stay like before.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Huh, well, must be tough to be so weak that you don’t even have enough people for things. You have to take up the position even if you don’t have the right attributes, huh?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “C’mon boys, stop veering off to unrelated topics at every chance. Well, you kids aren’t much different in my classes either, so I’m used to it.</p><p>And you’ll certainly get to learn more by speaking your thoughts plainly and arguing like that, instead of just quietly listening to me talking.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Aah… right. Sorry, that was ill manners.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Sure. Transfer Student, have you finished giving them out? Boys, unwrap the packaging and check it out.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… Ohh, this is—?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ohh! It’s our costumes! So they’ve been completed!”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Eh?—Ah… This is Rain-bows’s costume? For the live?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s impressive, Transfer Student. You weren’t even finished with the design last week, but now you’re done sewing them?</p><p>Come to think of it, you made the Trickstar outfits for us at great speed as well…</p><p>I heard Kiryuu-senpai helped you with those, but you did it all on your own this time, right?</p><p>That’s wonderful. I really do think you have a talent for making costumes.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/jkrAh4C.jpg"></p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Yeah. I thought it was gonna be some pauper-like costume, but this is pretty neat.</p><p>The material seems durable, yet easy to move in? You used a pretty high-end fabric, didn’t you?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/H9n4SiC.jpg"></p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Mmu? What’s wrong, Morisawa-senpai? Is it not to your liking?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ah, no… I think the costume is incredible. But this was made before we got the funds, right?</p><p>You have to properly demand compensation for the material cost, Transfer Student – I’m worried about you providing things at your own expense!</p><p>Also, I was just thinking. This is based on the costume Sagami-sensei used to wear in the past, right?</p><p>I thought I’d seen it somewhere before, so I was wondering for a bit where it was.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah, you can tell? It would’ve been tough to design from scratch, and it’s part of the magazine’s demand…</p><p>They told me to include some elements from the past me, so I asked her to incorporate them in the design.</p><p>But of course, replicating my old costume as-is would look old and lame, so the transfer student touched it up.</p><p>You guys would look fine, but I’m in my thirties already… I can’t wear fancy dazzling clothes made of primary colors. That’s gonna be embarrassing.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. Come to think of it, you wore really vibrant and ostentatious-looking costumes all the time when you were active, Sagami-sensei. Your entire body shining with gold and stuff.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. I had to stand out all on my own, and that’s just the sort of era it was.</p><p>Showbiz’s in a decline, but there are so many big guns with their mindset still stuck in the bubble economy.”</p><h3 id="revival-14">Revival / 14</h3><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, anyway. That costume’s for trial, so the transfer student’ll remake it if there are any problems. Also, she’s saying she’s willing to make more if you guys want?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “No, just these are good enough. Rain-bows is a young unit…</p><p>If we keep changing costumes while our image isn’t fixed yet, the audience may have a hard time remembering us.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah, and it’ll be more burden on the transfer student. She has more work than just making costumes.</p><p>This costume is very polished, so I believe there’s no problem with making this our official unit outfit.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Agreed~ Mine probably needs some adjustments though. Actually, I’ve gotten just a bit thinner since enrolling here…</p><p>So if you made this based on my data from then, it may be a little too big on me.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Mmu? Is that right, Himemiya? You’re dainty enough already… where would you be losing fat?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Yeah, lessons consume a lot of calories – but since I can’t be getting pimples by eating sugar, I’ve been holding back on that.</p><p>Well, figures I’d lose weight eventually.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “That’s not good at all, Himemiya – meat is power! Eat lots and build your stamina! I’ll give you the rest of my lunch ♪</p><p>Actually, this has eggplants here and there so I just couldn’t bring myself to eat it…!”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Don’t push your leftovers on me! I-I’m okay! My body’s always gained fat easily, so I’ll probably restore my weight in no time!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Hahaha. Okaaay, so to sum it up… you guys have no problem with the costume?</p><p>The transfer student just went ahead and finished it before I confirmed the design with you guys, so I was a little worried.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t make it sound like she’s at fault. In fact, praise her for getting the job done fast.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Sure. Good girl. This goes for the rest of you too, but… I’m so amazed at how rapidly the transfer student’s growing. Young’uns have it so nice.</p><p>Anyway, so we have the song and choreography ready through Hidaka’s father’s connections… one of his acquaintances.</p><p>Seeing how our lesson today progressed, we can probably get enough practice no problem until the day of.</p><p>And if the costume also got the OK, well, we can probably hold the live without excess or deficiency. We’ll still have to work on the pre-advertising and practice the fanservice we’ll be doing, though.</p><p>Ah, right. The magazine company did some promotion too, and will bring in audience from outside the school…</p><p>Since Project-Saga is steadily becoming a bigger topic, they said we can expect a good amount of people.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. If we have outsiders in the audience, does that mean it’s become an S1-ranked DreamFest?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No way, it’s nothing of that scale. The academy’s treating it like an official DreamFest, but it’s probably more of a special-case match that’s not bound by the system.</p><p>Just my intuition, but there will probably be more of this type of thing from now on.</p><p>The DreamFest system will probably undergo further transformation, since it doesn’t suit the times we’re in anymore.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Ah, President also said something like that.</p><p>He doesn’t show up at the student council office often, but when he does, he gets into a heated argument about the topic with vice prez each time.</p><p>And looking like they’re enjoying themselves. …the way I am, I can’t get in between those two yet.</p><p>Ah well. Then umm, so the point is, things are proceeding okay? And we just have to give all our effort and focus on perfecting our performance?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “That’s right. But I’ve found a little problem, so I was thinking to consult you guys about it.</p><p>Well, you see~ I’m not sure why either… but there seems to be another unit that wants to join this live.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. How is that a problem?</p><p>It’s not like we wanted to do a solo live no matter what. Having more participants gives it a sense of larger scale, which will help enliven things, right?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “True that! Fans of the other unit will come too; there are loads of good things! We accept any challenger, anytime…☆”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Just where did you guys earn that confidence, when Rain-bows hasn’t achieved anything yet? …well, so anyway, this is where things get funny.</p><p>This unit I’m talking about – Kunugi-sensei formed it.</p><p>And they have a teacher, a third year, a second year, and a first year gathered… as if imitating what we’re doing.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Kunugi-sensei did? I wonder why?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Who knows… Asked him, but he evaded the question. No idea.</p><p>Looking at the unit’s formation, maybe he wants to join Project-Saga too?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. Like, <em>I won’t let Sagami-sensei take all the glory!</em> kind of thing?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “He’s not supposed to be that type of guy. But anyway, it’s totally beyond me why he formed something like that and…</p><p>It’s kinda creepy, so let’s keep our guards up, is what I wanna say.</p><p>Kunugi-sensei’s not being himself. There’s a possibility somebody else made this undesirable suggestion to him.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Somebody… but who could that be? Don’t tell me – a mysterious organization aiming for world domination is brewing a conspiracy in the shadows of Project-Saga!?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nope, totally not. Hey, in these times, if you broadcast that kinda stupid nonsense on TV, the watchers will flame you for making things up.</p><p>But still, there’s something making me reaaaally uneasy about this… I’ll bug Kunugi-sensei some and poke around.</p><p>So that aside. They’re gonna participate in the same live show as us, so we’ll have to make some adjustments to the production to match them.</p><p>They seem to desire a live match, so we’ll have to study their style to plan against them, too.</p><p>In the event of a match, might will become right, but losing means we’ll profit less.</p><p>Project-Saga is supposed to center on <em>us</em>, so it’s gonna be shameful if we lose.</p><p>It’s even possible that… we’ll be excused from the project, and they’ll put Kunugi-sensei’s team in the center as replacement.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “H-Huuh… Well, if that means I won’t have to waste any more time on this stupid project, that’s fine by me—</p><p>But I guess it’ll frustrate me some. I hate losing, so much.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. I feel the same way. Of course, I’ll aim for victory.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. If we can reach a solution by talking it out, that would be best.</p><p>But if necessity calls, we have no choice… it’ll be too pathetic if we head out without any preparation, and end up flattened to the ground.</p><p>We have to use every hand possible to prepare for the battle. May I know what Kunugi-sensei’s unit is like, specifically?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ I don’t have much info on them yet. They’re a temporary unit formed later than us… about two days ago, out of nowhere.</p><p>So far, it seems like they haven’t done anything as a team.</p><p>Using my rights as a teacher, I got to take a look at their formation proposal. Couldn’t pick up more than their unit name and the members, though.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “That’s pretty useful information already. We may be able to estimate the extent of their ability somewhat, if the members are people we know.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay. So err, I’ll start with the unit members. The leader is naturally, Kunugi-sensei.</p><p>Unlike me, he hasn’t stopped polishing himself even after retirement, so he’ll be a formidable enemy.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “It would be a lot easier on us if you hadn’t stopped training too, Sagami-sensei… Well, I guess it’s weird to ask a retiree to keep doing lessons though.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ It wasn’t so long ago that Kunugi-sensei retired. I think he simply hasn’t fallen out of the habit.</p><p>Me, I’ve pretty much forgotten that I used to be an idol.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t forget that. The world remembers even if you forget.”</p><h3 id="revival-15">Revival / 15</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Anyway. So who are the other members of the temporary unit we’re matching up against?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Uuh, I’ll list them in order. The third year is MaM’s Mikejima, the second year is Valkyrie’s Kagehira,</p><p>and the first year is Switch’s… Harukawa? I think. With first years, I can’t immediately recall how the kid looks even hearing their name, sorry.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Ah, if it’s him, we’re in the same class. He seems to be something of a troublemaker; the teachers scold him all the time.</p><p>Well, <em>all</em> the kids in my class are like that~ I’m the only decent one there.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. But Valkyrie aside, I’m not familiar with the other two units…</p><p>Switch – I think that’s the unit Sakasaki from our class made?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm. MaM, or rather Mikejima-san I’m personally close with, so I have a good idea what he’s like.</p><p>He’s an incredibly capable man. Can probably stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Five Oddballs and Tenshouin.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “<em>Haah</em>!? President’s the greatest most excellent strongest top idol there is, okay!?</p><p>… huh, wait? What’s the Five Oddballs? You didn’t mean three?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah… there used to be five of them, so they were called the Five Oddballs.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “They were? It feels like I’ve heard the word before, I guess~?</p><p>So there are two additional guys that are like our unit’s Long Hair? Ueeehh…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. The guy named Sakasaki that I just mentioned was also one of the Five Oddballs.</p><p>If that Harukawa kid is in the same unit as him, that may make him the prized disciple of an Oddball.</p><p>Needless to say, this also applies to Kagehira who’s still part of Valkyrie, the unit that used to reign at the top of Yumenosaki Academy. He has the favors of another of the Five Oddballs, Itsuki Shuu.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah. I’m worried for Itsuki actually, since he hasn’t been coming to school much… but he treasures his comrades a lot, and he excels as a mentor.</p><p>I don’t really know Kagehira’s abilities; or rather, I can’t form an image of him even though I’ve watched Valkyrie’s performances multiple times…</p><p>He’s probably Itsuki’s cherished pupil who’s received his training. We should pay attention to him.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. The team members seemed as though they were picked out at random, but they all share the feeling of being mysterious powerhouses.</p><p>What is Kunugi-sensei planning to do by gathering that kind of people?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Who knows… He fancies himself the bespectacled intellect now, but back in the day, he acted on the fly a lot more than you’d expect.</p><p>It could really be a simple whim.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Hmph. Whatever the opponent’s planning, we just have to make them kneel to us by showing off our power, right?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ooh, you’re so dependable, Himemiya! You won’t even flinch in the face of a strong enemy! You’re so cool♪”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “He-Hehehe… Well, we still can’t let our guard down.</p><p>I don’t wanna get caught off guard just because I underestimated the enemy ever again, so we should probably investigate those guys thoroughly.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “… ah, I forgot to ask. Do those guys have a unit name?</p><p>We can’t keep calling them ‘those guys’, so I want to know their name to start with.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Right. Uhh… the thing is, I dunno how to read it. I wrote it down though; is this English? What’s the pronunciation?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Give it to me. Uhh, so it’s written &lt;Ba-barrier&gt;. You’re right this is difficult to read. Ba… va-ri-a?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Like bavarois? That’s surprisingly cute.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Lo0IDp5.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…♪ (looks at Touri and nods satisfiedly)”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm. I don’t think it’s that. Babari… Bar-ba-ri-an?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Barbarian? That’s a disturbing name. Not idol-like at all.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/NLJlkIZ.jpg"></p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ah, the transfer student’s saying that it may be pronounced like ‘baa-ba-ri-a’!”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “What language is that? Maybe a made-up word… I feel like I’m trying so hard to look deeply into it that I’m starting to draw a blank.</p><p>They probably have better naming sense compared to our cliched ‘Rain-bows’, though.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Well, I’m sure they put some deep meaning into it, but it’s hard to tell from just the letters.</p><p>So if we’re using the transfer student’s pronunciation for now… I see, this Ba-barrier group is our enemy.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. You seem happy, Hidaka; you get fired up when you have an opponent to beat, huh! I get you! Tickles your boyish spirit, doesn’t it ♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. I’m starting to realize after hearing people tell me lately: I may be a more aggressive guy than I thought.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “You’re practically a dog biting at everybody you come across; a feral dog.</p><p>… rather than that, I’m really clueless about Kunugi-sensei. What kind of idol was he before retiring?</p><p>If he’s the leader, he should be the one deciding the content of the unit performance and everything else. If we know his tastes and special skills, we may be able to build the right strategy against him.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay. Before I get to that, I’ll have to lay out an exposition of the history of idols.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “<em>Why</em>. Lunch break’s going to end soon, so we don’t have time to listen to your long speech.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Just hear me out here. It’s hard to explain what sort of idol Kunugi-sensei was.</p><p>He has a half-baked work history too, so I’d feel bad if he doesn’t get proper evaluation because of it.</p><p>This is part of Project-Saga’s goal anyway, so you guys should know at least the basic outline of the industry’s history.</p><p>It’s the old man’s favorite nostalgia time; sit tight and listen… Sagami-sensei is starting a class♪”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “We’re in your care! Ahh, this is great! To think I would hear the facts of history directly from a person who lived through it…☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m not very interested. The past is the past, and we live in the present.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Yup. The future’s the most important anyway.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “And that present and future of yours are continued from the past, okay? There seems to be someone scheming something behind this project—</p><p>And their reason for action is likely deeply rooted in the past. If not, they wouldn’t have staged a revival of retired idols after all this time.</p><p>I’m decrepit and my vision is blurry; I can’t get a clear view on what we’re getting wrapped up in.</p><p>But if I fill you guys in on the background knowledge you don’t have and see things from a new point of view, I may be able to pick up on things I didn’t before.</p><p>In the entertainment industry, the murky past gets hushed up and fades with the passage of time until it’s completely forgotten…</p><p>But I wouldn’t know what to say to the predecessors that way, so I wanna pass on the stories when it’s possible.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I understand! Kamen R*der also periodically does recaps of past series to remind us of history!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Stop relating everything to tokusatsu. …well, that doesn’t matter; I’ll give you a simple summary of the history of the idol industry.</p><p>First, there was one idol. Put bluntly, he was like God. He created all the things that became the foundation of the present idol business.</p><p>Here’s an example. There was a year-end festival that used to center mostly on general celebrities and musicians, where idols were included only as accessories…</p><p>…and somehow, he managed to transform it into an event completely by idols and for idols.</p><p>That’s SS, which is still being held even now.</p><p>He also caused countless other revolutions, large and small. Before, idols were just part of the broad definition of musician…</p><p>…like a niche branch, but he made the industry flourish and prosper like its own genre.</p><p>Before that, of course there were people who referred to themselves as idols, or got referred to as one…</p><p>… but he singularized the existence known as an idols, redefining them into a special presence different from the rest.</p><p>The word ‘idol’ carried entirely different connotations before and after that person appeared.</p><p>This is difficult to understand for people who weren’t there to witness it; it’s from before I was born too, so I’m just repeating what my seniors told me.</p><p>But it seems he really changed <em>everything</em>. History was stirred, and the world was overturned completely at the hands of a single person—</p><p>Compared to the achievements that person left behind, what I pulled off has no worth at all.”</p><h3 id="revival-16">Revival / 16</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Did such a person really exist? I can’t believe it so easily; it sounds like some exaggerated legend to me.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, figures. Rumors always come with exaggerated details.</p><p>Nobody can say what really happened except the people who actually lived through the change.</p><p>Anyway, it may sound like a myth, which may or may not contain historical truth…</p><p>But that person <em>did</em> exist, and he retained a strong influence even in his later life.</p><p>He was active for a long time as an idol, and became a magnate who controlled the industry from the shadows upon retirement, I heard. Well, this is also pretty much an urban legend.</p><p>Apparently, when I was active, that person was still holding on, just barely…</p><p>…and he stretched out his tentacles to many fields outside the idol industry, reigning over everything from the shadows and in the light.</p><p>Like a ringleader of the industry, a Godfather. …I guess kids these days don’t know a movie that old anymore?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…I might’ve heard of him before. His name often turned up in social parties; it seems he also had a strong power over the stock market.</p><p>Yeah. The timeline matches up, I think. Since you said it was when you were active, that means about ten years ago, right, Sagami-sensei?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yep. I retired at around 22 years old, so roughly around that time. Huh, I was skeptical too, but…</p><p>I guess someone like that could’ve existed for real; someone with such outrageous power.</p><p>So anyway, that was the dawn of history. The root of the current idol business, of the present.</p><p>The Genesis, if this were the Bible. The part where God said, <em>Let there be light</em>.</p><p>So <em>Let there be idols</em>, in his case? That person was obsessively in love with idols.</p><p>All so idols would be elevated to greater heights, so their domain would spread even wider—</p><p>So the masses would acknowledge them, seek for them— He did everything in his power for that, even on his deathbed.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “… that’s just like Eichi-sama.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn? Did you say something, Himemiya?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Ah, nothing… But he’s gone, right? Doesn’t that mean he has practically nothing to do with us?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “The thing is, not necessarily. That person’s power and treasury were divvied up to various factions and handed down over time… They became the pillars of the current business.</p><p>There were also many idols that kinda took on his position as a godlike, monumental idol.</p><p>I heard rumors about how SS was, put bluntly, an event to search for someone to assume that position.</p><p>Since long ago when that person was alive— no, since the time when he was still active, he had always sought for someone suitable to succeed his position.</p><p>Well, that goal’s been lost, and SS has simply become a ‘fancy annual festival’.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Oi. Don’t say something that would make me lose my motivation for SS; I’m a participant.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahaha. Well, SS is still <em>the</em> largest-scale festival held by the idol industry, be it now or back then…</p><p>It may have lost its original purpose somewhat, but its value has never fallen.</p><p>The number of fans looking forward to the event has in fact increased compared to when that person was active. And as long as the fans are happy, that’s an idol’s justice, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. Well, you’re right.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I am. Anyway, that person… the original super idol retired and disappeared from the stage.</p><p>After that, he kept controlling things from the shadows, exercising more power than anyone had the right to…</p><p>…but that brought the need for someone else to stand on stage in his place.</p><p>An advertisement tower; a totem; the face of the industry that everyone would immediately think of when they heard the word idol.</p><p>He needed the next super idol.</p><p>That’s why after he vanished from the stage, a single man… a super idol would be placed to stand there, substituted again with each era.</p><p>With that person’s support, generation after generation of super idol shone intensely as the sun of the business.</p><p>Their fans would undergo change with the times, but they would unchangingly entertain them and gain their love.</p><p>Such a blissful period continued, for a long time.</p><p>A lone super idol rose from the horizon high into the sky and sank again; this circle repeated.</p><p>It wasn’t always smooth sailing, even if each period was blessed with an excellent super idol who suited the title.</p><p>But the original super idol was so great, none of them could hold onto the position for long, or so I heard.</p><p>Apparently, there were even dangerous times where the super idols kept getting switched out for new ones without even a year passing.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…I feel like I’m listening to a lecture about the emperors of Ancient Rome.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah, I think your impression is about right.</p><p>Some godlike existence founded an empire, and era after era… an emperor was appointed by the god to reign for a period.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “The divine right of kings was a story made up by later Rome; a political doctrine, but… I know what you’re trying to say.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Huh, if it’s anything like the Roman Empire, keeping the people ignorant for easier rule eventually became the norm and backfired.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Right. That’s not off the mark, in fact, but we’ll talk about that later.</p><p>Anyway, so that’s the history of the idol industry. There were good times and bad times.</p><p>As an example of the good times, we can take a look at Hidaka’s dad’s era.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…what, my father?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Hey, what’s with that fed up look on your face each time your parents get brought up? Your dad is an incredible man… Respect him more, kid.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…I <em>do</em> respect him – the minimum amount necessary.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Haha. Must be hard for the Hidaka couple, their only son being stuck in a rebellious phase.</p><p>Anyway, your father being the top idol of a past era is historical fact.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. That’s what troubles me; his light is too bright.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Y’know, you say some strangely smart things lately.</p><p>Well anyway, so while Hidaka dad was reigning, there were no big problems in the idol industry.</p><p>The world prospered, the people submitted to joy and bliss, and everything was radiant with light.</p><p>Until <em>a certain person</em> appeared, the super idols more or less did their part well.</p><p>At the very least, it was unthinkable for a situation that could turn over the entire industry to happen.</p><p>Because the original super idol set it up to be that kind of system.</p><p>But the times were rapidly changing,. Even with the strings that person pulled from the shadows and the super idols doing their best, they couldn’t catch up with the world anymore.</p><p>With every moment, the state of the world underwent transformation; there were many eye-opening technological discoveries just in the media…</p><p>Even a system created by an ultimate genius couldn’t survive the stormy waves of that era unscathed. It was showing its age, really.</p><p>That’s when the case of ‘that Akehoshi’ happened.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah… So that certain person you mentioned really was—”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “—‘That Akehoshi’, huh?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Eh? Eh? What’s ‘that Akehoshi’ about? Who? Akehoshi is that overloud and obnoxious guy in Trickstar, right?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “… not <em>that</em> Akehoshi, even if he’s not unrelated. Well, don’t look too deeply into it. It’s all in the past.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. Anyway, so as that person reached a tragic end, the idol business also fell into dark times.</p><p>Nothing would go well, society spat on us and turned its back; it was a dark, cold period that nobody in the industry wants to look back on, probably.</p><p>The super idols had shone like sparkling stars, but the curtain had to fall on the radiant times they’d sustained and amassed.</p><p>The idols’ golden era is nothing more than a ghost of the past, something only depicted in mythology or history now.</p><p>The winter is still going on, even now. A lot of time has passed since that case happened, we’re entering a new generation, and everybody’s starting to forget…</p><p>But the system that supported the idol business is busted; we’re just hanging by a thread, barely managing to slow down our ruin.”</p><h3 id="revival-17">Revival / 17</h3><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “… it’s exactly because we’re living in such cold times – that your existence as the idol who restored the lost radiance to the industry even for just a moment was like a miracle, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. I probably shouldn’t be saying this about myself, but it probably was a miracle. But miracles are called miracles because they don’t happen that often.</p><p>I worked real hard and managed to prolong its life some, but this business is suffering from a fatal wound.</p><p>We can’t do anything about it. It went right back to where it started as soon as I retired anyway.</p><p>It’s <em>really</em> weird to say this about myself, but I was the last super idol.</p><p>After that, the industry was just overrun by a disorderly mob; with no super idol to lead them, nor any of them achieving enough to rise as the next one…</p><p>Like Himemiya said, it pretty much became an era of the ignorant masses.</p><p>That original super idol passed away, too. There’s no one to stand at the top, the magnate who would support the industry’s gone from the world…</p><p>Now it’s just filled with robbers scavenging for ancient relics and treasures in chaotic ruins that nobody rules. That’s the sort of sad time we live in.</p><p>What do people call this stuff again? Post-apocalypse?</p><p>I mean, when I watched a movie with that catchphrase, I seriously went ‘Wow, it’s the idol business’ in my head.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “The world after the end, a post-apocalypse… Are we really in such a horrible times? I personally don’t want to think that way.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, I feel like I exaggerated some things there. But in summary yeah, that’s the present we’re in.</p><p>Going back to our original topic; Kunugi-sensei was somebody who was born to such wintry times…</p><p>… and had the bad luck of appearing after the Super Idol Sagami Jin, the industry’s first bright topic in a long while.</p><p>It’s not so strange he’d seem duller in comparison.</p><p>He had passion, and maybe about the same amount of talent as I did. But he couldn’t bud because he was born to the wrong times.</p><p>It was a wasteland with no sign of life; no flower could’ve bloomed there.</p><p>The momentary boom I brought seemed to attract some sort of movement trying to revive the industry and make it prosper again…</p><p>… but that also caused the mechanisms and the mood of the business to be constantly on the change.</p><p>Nobody could’ve made the best out of their gifts. Plus, he went so far as to discover some admiration for me, becoming fixated on an outdated mindset…</p><p>So the constant shifting of the times threw him in for a loop, and after a long while of clinging onto the business, he had to retire with an unsatisfactory track record.</p><p>Which made him who he is. He’s gone through a lot – much more than I have.</p><p>He’s the studious type, so he’s knowledgeable on the golden era of idols.</p><p>And he has experienced those dark times that were much like a bubbling witch’s cauldron… he’s a living witness of it.</p><p>He knows the bitter and the sweet. And he’s been unrewarded despite his great efforts; he’s got a taste of failures and how irrational things can be.</p><p>That’s why he’s fit to be a teacher.</p><p>I doubt anyone wants to hear me bragging about my past, and honestly it’s worth nothing in these times—</p><p>But his stories of failures and hardships are the sort of tragedy the world still overflows with.</p><p>He just doesn’t want the kids to repeat the same mistakes he did.</p><p>Probably. That’s why when he says ‘<em>Don’t come this way!</em>’, it probably really <em>does</em> mean that way’s doomed.</p><p>That’s something I can’t tell you; hard facts only Kunugi-sensei, as someone who couldn’t become a super idol, can teach.</p><p>So children, lend an ear to what Kunugi-sensei tells you. Well, both Kunugi-sensei and I are still relics of the past, maybe even ghosts…</p><p>At the end of the day, you guys who are living through the present in real time should think with your head and choose the path you wanna live on your own.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I see. I will etch that advice into my heart. But haven’t we strayed awfully far from the topic?</p><p>How did we end up with a grand history class when we started out asking about Kunugi-sensei’s abilities?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahaha. I thought you might misjudge him if you don’t know firsthand what his standing was in history and what sort of times he lived through.</p><p>He’s got a mediocre track record and I often joke about it…</p><p>But I want you to know he had every capability to succeed; that he didn’t was the fault of the times he lived in.</p><p>In fact, since he was from a time when the entire idol industry was struggling desperately to pull through…</p><p>He’s far richer in experience than I am.</p><p>Unlike me, he formed a unit, and he also had to work as a comedian for some time.</p><p>Sure, he’s evaluated about average in pretty much all those fields, save for singing – thanks to having that pretty voice as a weapon – and gravure.</p><p>But that conversely means he’s <em>at least</em> average in everything.</p><p>He’s an all-rounder; so if you only build a strategy to deal with his singing 'cause you think that’s what he’s good at, you’re prolly in for a painful experience.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Does that mean there’s no way to plan against him? Then what was this long talk for…?</p><p>Well, I did learn a lot of facts I didn’t know before.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yup. I said in the beginning, didn’t I? That I’m gonna ‘start a class’. So if you learned, that’s great.</p><p>I know it’s annoying having to sit through a middle-aged guy rambling about the past, but somebody’s gotta pass on this stuff.</p><p>They’re nothing so noble or pretty as to be called heroic epics, but…</p><p>It’s the history of the world I offered up my youth for, the same world you guys are currently living in.</p><p>You won’t lose anything from hearing about it. Just to be clear, everything I said was real. Maybe I exaggerated… but I’m a school teacher, I don’t teach lies.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn? What’s wrong, Himemiya? You look disturbed. I guess my talk’s boring for children, after all?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Nuh-uh… I didn’t have the slightest idea about anything, so I think it’s nice that I got to hear all of that. I wasn’t interested in idols at all, in the past.”</p><p>(…I see. So this is the present we’re living in. That’s why Eichi-sama is an <em>Emperor</em> and a <em>top idol</em>. That’s why he’s called that way…</p><p>Is he planning to become a greater existence, to stand at the top as a ‘super idol’, and bring the radiant golden era back to the idol industry?</p><p>No? Eichi-sama doesn’t seem to like being called Emperor, does he…?</p><p>Of course. Lowering the curtain on the old era to make a new world… so <em>fine</em>.</p><p>If it’s Eichi-sama, he can definitely reach greater heights than those many super idols in history.</p><p>He can become as great an existence as that godlike ‘original super idol’, or maybe something more.</p><p>No, he’s definitely working hard for that already…</p><p>Sagami-sensei only explained the broad scope of history, so I don’t have a grasp on the current state of affairs.</p><p>Like I got to study world history but only left with a vague idea on contemporary history. But Eichi-sama’s standing at the head of that – fighting on the frontlines, even now.</p><p>I’m still lacking, but I wanna grow more and more so I can support him.</p><p>I insisted despite Papa and Mama’s opposition and enrolled to Yumenosaki, all for that.</p><p>Well… even if I’m being made to take a pointless roundabout path and act as Rain-bows now.)</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Mmu? What’s wrong, Himemiya! You seem tired!</p><p>Your head must’ve hurt from hearing so many difficult topics in one go! To tell the truth, I’m the same! We’re the same; it’s great to be the 'same’♪”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Shut up~… Rather than that, it’s about time for the bell to go.</p><p>Shouldn’t we like, start cleaning up and return to class?

There’s also the risk of a fire breaking out, so be careful.</p><p>Plus, the magazine companies are starving for gossip lately, you know.

Why go out of their way to publish articles that put us down despite that?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Because it sells better that way – why else?

Afraid of eventually growing to hate what I love.</p><p>I’d thought many times that the heroes on TV were liars… and almost resented them for it.</p><p>But I embrace them in the end, because I love them, after all.</p><p>But will even that feeling… eventually fade and disappear?</p><p>I’d hate for that to happen – even the thought of it scares me. I can’t put it well but… is that just how it is, Sensei?</p><p>Will the things that engrossed me as a child not matter to me anymore, once I become an adult?</p><p>If so, then am I doing something incredibly pointless by chasing after it with all my life right now…?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Morisawa.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ah, yes! What is it, sir?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I’m a school teacher and not your parent <em>nor</em> your counselor. To be blunt, I’m not here to provide the answer to your teenage angst.</p><p>However. You’re a pretty good guy, so I <em>do</em> want to spare you some advice if I can.</p><p>Nah, I should at least show you <em>what not to be</em>, since I haven’t set a good example like a real teacher would.</p><p>You know, I’m… yeah, I loved idols. It was my dream. My first love was fond of them, and that inspired me to become one.</p><p>Sounds like I was a dumb brat, right? Just like you.</p><p>But where my blood and sweat took me was an idol industry that had already rotted.</p><p>The radiant, golden era was past, and the world that I had dreamed of, that the person I loved had dreamed of, was over.</p><p>It was a world that had already ended. The dirty and greedy adults used me to their convenience… Battered and exhausted, I got soiled to the soul.</p><p>I just stopped caring.</p><p>So I did a lot of impulsive things, you see. I was desperate, so I didn’t care what would happen as a result.</p><p>Some saw it as me standing up against the rotten industry and fighting.</p><p>But that was just me blowing myself up. Attacking an enormous enemy expecting them to take me down. To be frank, I never thought for a moment that I could reform anything.</p><p>I was a powerless, spoiled brat kicking up a fuss and bawling his eyes out because he couldn’t take it. I hated it all so much, I couldn’t hold it in, so I was venting my stress.</p><p>Yet the idol industry didn’t desert me. I was their breadwinner, the only one. Who would let go of a hen that laid golden eggs?</p><p>So my actions only escalated. I started testing to see how much they would be willing to forgive me for.</p><p>Drank, smoked, played around with girls.</p><p>Despite that, they let me run wild for a while. Heck, the idol industry even did their best to protect such a worthless guy.</p><p>They got rid of scandals, manipulated information, and lied to people.</p><p>I hated it all the more, seeing that. I’m unsalvageable trash, the world I live in is rotten, there are no such things as hopes or dreams…</p><p>That’s what I thought. It tasted like despair.</p><p>That didn’t last long, though. They weighed the loss they would have to suffer by keeping a troublemaker like me around, against the profit I could make them as an idol—</p><p>Eventually the scale fell on the former, and they cast me aside.</p><p>Even at the end, they made up some bull as my reason for retirement and made it into a peaceful sendoff,</p><p>but what really happened was, I was trash who ruined myself for everybody to see. The idol industry couldn’t defend me anymore, and cut me off.</p><p>Nothing beautifully dramatic about it.</p><p>Humans, you see… When they achieve success by accident without knowing the reason behind it… they go mad.</p><p>I think I was out of my mind then. Deranged, and got myself wiped out as a result.</p><p>It’s a story you’d find anywhere.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…”</p><h3 id="revival-22">Revival / 22</h3><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/GFNRzYD.jpg"></p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “But y’know, now I think it was definitely a misunderstanding on my part – the belief that everything was rotten.</p><p>I was a dumb brat with a narrow outlook, who couldn’t see reality properly—</p><p>But Akiyan was always by my side, supporting me. I think the other kids from school were simply, purely, rooting for me too.</p><p>I met a lot of people worthy of respect among those I worked with.</p><p>And even though I did, in fact, do a bunch of things I shouldn’t have…</p><p>The originator of Project-Saga – the gramps from the magazine company – believed that ‘<em>It must be a mistake!</em>’ and fought in my defense till the end.</p><p>I was just an ingrate covering my own eyes. …so I want to repay the love and favors that were given to me.</p><p>Many fans sent me letters and flower bouquets upon retirement. During the press conference where I announced it, I saw a bunch of adults bawling their eyes out.</p><p>They told me… <em>I love you, I admire you, I could live on thanks to you</em>.</p><p>And I think those words and feelings couldn’t have been all lies. Humans aren’t such worthless living beings.</p><p>The trash is probably only a small minority – and I’m included.</p><p>It was only after I couldn’t turn back, after I retired, that I realized…</p><p>Only after everything was over that I realized, what a cruel thing I’d done.</p><p>I betrayed all their faith and affection.</p><p>I was loved, yet I was selfishly convinced that I was alone in a rotten world, and self-destructed all because I couldn’t bear it.</p><p>I should’ve hung in there and gritted my teeth. As long as somebody, even just one person, still loved me.</p><p>… but I couldn’t. That was the end of it, that was everything.</p><p>This is gonna sound like an excuse, but an industry isn’t something for a lone youth to bear on their shoulders.</p><p>Not everybody can manage what that original super idol that I talked to you about did.</p><p>Humans can’t become gods. That person was the true miracle; the product of an impossible coincidence.</p><p>There’s no way we can copy someone like that.</p><p>In the end, idols are idols – not God himself.</p><p>The old system of the idol industry, centered on a super idol who stood lonely at the top, wouldn’t work in the present; things have gotten a lot more complicated.</p><p>But everyone has clung onto it… ceased thinking and kept repeating the past, leaving the idol industry in its current hopeless state.</p><p>That’s why, now’s probably when a revolution is really needed. The buds have been poking out in places, slowly but steadily, since Kunugi-sensei’s time.</p><p>It’s because a super idol doesn’t exist in these times that a system that wouldn’t rely on super idols is getting brought to life.</p><p>I think things are heading in a good direction, so… I’m rooting for you kids.</p><p>The conception of the Five Oddballs, and Tenshouin’s revolution, seemed to me like nothing more but a reimagination of that ancient super idol system.</p><p>So to be honest, I couldn’t like it;</p><p>the mindset that a lone person or the chosen few had to bear <em>everything</em>. I knew from experience that it was impossible… or at least incredibly difficult.</p><p>But, I probably underestimated Tenshouin’s group. It was probably just part of the process.</p><p>The policies born from back then, like the unit system, are now laying the groundwork for the coming era.</p><p>We can’t do it alone. Then, just support the industry together with everyone.</p><p>Lean on your teammates and share the load.</p><p>That’s what units are for, right? It isn’t just about pulling down powerful individuals by giving them a weakness in the shape of ‘other people’.</p><p>Probably. Though it seems the system was misused for that purpose during the subjugation-or-whatever of the Five Oddballs.</p><p>But the true goal was like I mentioned, right? The people, and not a god, supporting society as its center.</p><p>That fortifies it better. Even if one person gets crushed, another will take their place, so the system renews itself and holds out for longer.</p><p>The value of powerful individuals falls, but that means there’s a chance for smaller forces to polish each other as they compete for the top.</p><p>It gives a stability, a balance of power. There won’t be a danger of the entire industry toppling over just because an individual went a little berserk, like during my time.</p><p>Instead of having a lone dictator at the lead, present society is about people making the world go 'round by putting their power together.</p><p>The world has long changed, and now the idol industry’s finally catching up with it.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/XgHE7uo.jpg"></p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “… fufu. I thought you were so committed to your retired life that you’d closed off your eyes and ears completely, but it seems you’ve been watching us closely, sir.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Of course. I’m your teacher, it’s my job to watch over my students.</p><p>Maaaybe? I ended up rambling while shaving; I hope I’m not getting a razor rash…</p><p>Let’s just head out already; I’m a tad nervous since it’s my first appearance onstage in a long time.</p><p>But I’m a retired idol, so it wouldn’t be anything weird if I failed, I guess. Sorry if I slip up, you guys better cover for me when I do. …I’m counting on you, Morisawa.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yes. Unlike when you were active, Sagami-sensei, you have teammates now. You have <em>us</em>, so please rest easy.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “… cheeky brat. Ah well, I’m glad you seem to have taken my talk well.</p><p>You’re still a kid, so maybe you get anxious sometimes.</p><p>You became a third year before you knew it, stuck with the duty to look cool in front of your juniors… and maybe you can’t show them a weak side.</p><p>So. If you get any more of these worries in the future, just come to talk to me in secret. If a lousy old man’s hard-luck story is what you seek, I’m more than happy to answer.</p><p>But seriously, I think you brats are gonna be fine. Just my intuition – but the era’s changed, after all.</p><p>When things get unbearable, look around you, don’t suffer alone. Keep that in mind, if you don’t want to lose your mind and get crushed like I did.</p><p>You’re not alone. As long as <em>you</em> don’t avert your eyes from it, your love will bear fruit. Somebody will love you back. Don’t forget that.</p><p>And 'cause you’re not alone, you’ll be fine. Even without becoming God, saving the world is a piece of cake.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Understood. That’s the legendary hero, Ryuusei Rainbow for you… You mean to say that I just have to recall Ryuuseitai’s catchphrase when I face hard times, right?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “? What catchphrase?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Huh, don’t you know? No, of course you do, right?</p><p>After all, it was said the old Ryuuseitai took it as their catchphrase after you said it on your tokusatsu show, Sagami-sensei!</p><p>I love it so I say it often too – <em>One for all, all for one!</em>”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahh… Bluntly speaking, I stole that from <em>The Three Musketeers</em>. You should know since you’re a bookworm, Morisawa.</p><p>Ah well. I was a bit worried, actually…</p><p>Morisawa, you said you admired me, right? So I wondered if you wanted to become a super idol.</p><p>But that’s not it, huh? What you wanted to be, it was a hero all along.”</p><p>(Haha. Even if it doesn’t strike a chord with me, I guess it’s not bad to read out from scripts sometimes.</p><p>There are people who will listen earnestly, be moved and let it ring inside their heart.</p><p>Aah, I wish I could tell my old self. I wanna give him a talking to: ‘Wow, you’re such an idiot!’</p><p>‘You couldn’t see what was all around you, and thought you were bearing the burden of everything on your own.’</p><p>But too late for that, and it’s also thanks to that past that I’m here now.</p><p>Guess I should at least break my back to turn the youth and future of these kids into something brighter.</p><p>I’m a schoolteacher, so I gotta act like one sometimes.</p><p>About that much is what’s befitting of a mere man. Isn’t that right, God?)</p><h3 id="revival-23">Revival / 23</h3><p><strong>&gt; Saga Stage</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/nCcIwJy.jpg"></p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Himemiya, are you ready?</p><p>Right, it seems you’re done changing.

C-Can you <em>not</em> go ahead and touch me without permission!? Everybody in Rain-bows is too touchy-feely, seriously!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. You seem tense, are you okay? It’s our first live as Rain-bows, so I guess even you can’t hide your nervousness?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “<em>H-Haah</em>? As if I would ever get nervous! Can you stop taking me for a fool!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m not. I’m worried for you, Himemiya.</p><p>You’re a first year, so you’re probably unused to doing live shows. I haven’t seen <em>fine</em> doing many idol activities since their defeat in DDD, either.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Whose fault do you think that is… You really tick me off.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. Maybe saying this will just make you even angrier with me, but – I apologize for hurting you.</p><p>But I never thought for a moment that I should’ve lost back during DDD.</p><p>We gave our everything for what we wanted to do; you guys and me both. We fought for our dreams, and this was the result.</p><p>We can’t change that past, no matter how hard we pray.</p><p>…Last year, I stood on the mop-up stage of the student council president’s, <em>fine</em>’s, revolution and experienced a cruel defeat at their hands.</p><p>You weren’t <em>fine</em> yet, so maybe you don’t know.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Ah… I would usually be in the audience as a fan of <em>fine</em>, so I might know.</p><p>Come to think of it, I think I saw someone like you on the old <em>fine</em>’s last stage. He had some weird name, if I recall, like Hokk—”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “The name doesn’t matter. Erase it from your mind; it was thought up on the fly. I think it was buchou’s way of being considerate.</p><p>If I hid myself behind a mask and an alias, even if the people onstage and the audience remembered me…</p><p>People in the future who can only learn from the records won’t know who I was.</p><p>Maybe buchou did that so I wouldn’t have to suffer a huge scratch on my track record while he got me wrapped up in a tragic battle we couldn’t win.</p><p>Well, it could simply be because he thought ‘it’s funnier that way’ too.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…that stuff matters even less. What are you trying to say, Hidaka-senpai?’</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right. To be honest, that defeat frustrated me immensely. Just like you, I let my anger and resentment build up, so I wouldn’t forget.</p><p>But my comrades gave me a positive cause to channel my gloom and bitterness into.</p><p>The emotions I held became a driving force for my new self, one of the components that helped lead our revolution to success – that’s what I believe.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Hmph. So you’re saying you weren’t obliged to be loyal to <em>fine</em> since they did something cruel to you? That you were justified in betraying us?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s not it. In other words, umm… I can’t put it well, but you and myself from back then are alike, in their standings and the feelings they hold.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “And? We should be friends because we’re so alike?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s not it either. We don’t have to be friends; Rain-bows is just something thrown together for Project-Saga.</p><p>If you can’t fit in, you’re free to go; nobody will stop you.</p><p>You don’t have to put your life on the line, either. But I also don’t want you to think you’re wasting your time. I mean, that’s not what I want to say… it’s more… uuh.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “… okay, okay. So you’re a terrible speaker, Senpai, I got it.</p><p>I thought I could act the stubborn brat and get through this without you and I having to communicate.</p><p>But then you’re going to keep bothering me and that’s a lot of hassle, so I’ll catch on. I’ll say <em>Yes, I understand</em>. Be thankful.</p><p>So, because <em>you</em> used your personal grudges as your driving force, persevered without giving in, and got what you wanted as a result… I can <em>and</em> should do the same? You’re encouraging me?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Huh? Yeah, that’s right… that’s it!</p><p>You’re so smart, Himemiya. There, there ♪”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “What, are you copying Morisawa-senpai?

But right now, I’m a nobody.</p><p>No one knows Rain-bows yet, and I probably still don’t have fans who like <em>me</em> individually either.</p><p>So it’s really scary. Like I’ve been hurled onto the stage naked, to be judged to the liking of people who won’t know me, people who won’t coddle me.</p><p>I’m afraid – what if I slip up?

Especially back when Trickstar was just formed. Everyone gave in to the student council’s rule.</p><p>At least, that’s how it looked; revolution seemed like a pipe dream.</p><p>I considered it many times. That maybe I was doing something stupid…</p><p>That maybe nobody was wishing for this, maybe I was kicking up a fuss just because I was bitter over having been hurt.</p><p>Maybe, I’d made a mess over something silly, dragging my friends down with me…</p><p>I talked big about it being a revolution, but maybe I was a scoundrel disturbing the peace of many in vain.</p><p>Maybe it was all true. What I did might’ve been a small incident that won’t go down in history.</p><p>The revolution came to be, and I do feel Yumenosaki is slowly changing… but nobody can tell yet if it was for the better or worse.</p><p>The children who live in the future will look back and be the judges.</p><p>But I think waiting around for that day to come is what a fool does.</p><p>That’s why I’m doing what I want now. For my dream, my future, myself. I’m going to walk down the path I choose, not submitting to somebody’s orders.</p><p>So. While I feel sorry for what I did to you guys, I’m glad I left <em>fine.</em></p><p>Maybe working under the student president as his soldier would lead to my success as an idol.</p><p>But – that wouldn’t be <em>my</em> life.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “… I can’t believe you just told the very person you hurt ‘<em>I’m glad I betrayed you</em>.’ Your shamelessness might as well be a breath of fresh air at this point.</p><p>Ah well. …I think I was jealous of you, Hidaka-senpai. I wanted, <em>begged</em> to be let into <em>fine</em>.</p><p>It might’ve been part of his ploy, but President himself chose to make you one of us. He scouted you, told you he wanted you.</p><p>He never told that to me. So I was frustrated, and I despised you for throwing away the thing I wanted so easily; I didn’t get you.</p><p>I still don’t. You’re expressionless like a robot; I don’t know what you’re thinking.</p><p>But, I see. You used to be what I am now, Senpai.</p><p>I remember. That day, <em>fine</em>’s revolution came to be, and Eichi-sama beckoned me over…</p><p>That stage, overflowing with light, shone to me like a happy-ever-after.</p><p>But, although I couldn’t see them through the blinding light, there were actually people crying behind that stage, huh?</p><p>That should’ve been obvious, but I never even considered that until now.</p><p>Maybe society, all Yumenosaki students, everybody…</p><p>…thought they reached a happy ending when your revolution came to be in DDD.</p><p>But there are people who cried because they lost. People who relive it in their nightmares every night.</p><p>Happily ever after?

Then Rain-bows will be all gathered, huh? A rainbow that’s missing some colors would look ugly; I’m glad they’re coming like they’re supposed to.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. … oh, I was thinking to look for Morisawa-senpai from here, but I found Transfer Student instead.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Ah, you’re right!

Stuff happened, like during Circus.</p><p>I think I’ve been horrible to her. And I probably still am – to you, Hidaka-senpai. …I’m sorry.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hm? Did you say something?

Thanks, Himemiya, I’m confident in my acting as a prince if nothing else.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “It’s definitely not acting – you don’t even realise that you’re doing it. Ticks me off… Dense and oblivious, but optimistic and strong.</p><p>It makes me look stupid for acting all sharp and aggressive to you.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What? I can’t hear if you mumble like that; there’s a bigger crowd gathered than I imagined and it’s really loud.</p><p>Hehe, since I can hear you better if our faces are closer, should I carry you in my arms like a princess?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Worry about yourself.

Still, it sure is embarrassing… for <em>me</em> to stand on stage wearing an idol outfit, in front of a crowd this large. Why are there so many people in the audience, anyway?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah, there are more people than I expected. Did the magazine company behind Project-Saga work hard on the promotion?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I don’t think magazines make for such a good promotion method these days.</p><p>Mr. Writer came to cheer for us today – I heard from him that we became a hot topic on the net.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/d2QoBOC.jpg"></p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Mr. Writer… ah, he’s right beside Anzu. So I heard he’s still a student?</p><p>And he’s in the company due to some connection with a big shot there, and not even a company employee, but a part-time worker?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah, that’s what I heard too. Actually, Project-Saga’s popularity went beyond even his expectations, and that seemed to have scared him – he looked white as sheet.</p><p><em>If</em> there is some conspiracy behind Project-Saga, Mr. Writer’s the most obvious suspect due to being a mole from the magazine,</p><p>but based on that attitude, he might really be a clueless errand boy.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “You’re still suspicious of something like that, Sagami-sensei?</p><p><em>Innocent until proven guilty</em> is the standard in the legal world, right? Mr. Writer’s a good guy who worked earnestly for our sake… let’s have more faith in him.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I’m not accusing him, and I have faith in his character. It’s just his exact type of ‘earnest, good kids’ are the ones most easily manipulated by bad adults.</p><p>You guys – and the transfer student too – are pretty much the same type, so be careful. In these times, we can’t just assume that there’s kindness to be found everywhere.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Mmu, now he’s rebuking <em>us</em>. I didn’t even say a thing…</p><p>Anyway, isn’t having a big audience a good thing for idols? What are you complaining about?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Children are so nice and simple, eh? I should learn from your example, Himemiya; it’s just as you said.</p><p>Project-Saga’s popularity could simply be because it fits with the demands of the times.</p><p>We’re currently a super-ageing society, with young people being the minority, so the elderly with a fondness for nostalgia may make up the largest part of the market.</p><p>So instead of sparkling new idols with unexplored sides, it’s the nostalgic, retired ones that rake in more audience and money. What a distasteful time…</p><p>The magazine company, or rather that bigwig who commissioned this project, foresaw that trend, huh?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha. Come to think of it, we’ve been having a revival boom, haven’t we? I’m personally happy about it, as it gives people a chance to get to know old titles.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nah… we old men prefer to see you young’uns work hard and open up a completely new world, ya know?</p><p>Being stuck with a view that never changes is the same as dying… so you guys gotta give it your all today.</p><p>Surprise the crowd gathered here and make them say ‘Wow, these kids are way more awesome than Sagami Jin!’ Swallow me up, use me as a stepping stone and walk ahead.</p><p>When we’re done with Project-Saga, I’ll be retired once and for all… watching you guys thrive as I live out the rest of my life in pleasure; that’s my plan.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You keep acting like you’re old… but you’re still young, Sensei.</p><p>Look, some of the guests are glancing at you and saying ‘Who’s that boy?

For lives that are open to the public, students usually don’t watch from the crowd.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. The students are definitely eager to see the teacher they usually study under show his true abilities from up close. I’d watch from the front row too, if I were them.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ukh~… They don’t have to see, though. Don’t they have better things to do?</p><p>Nobody’s made a new move after DDD, so I wonder if they’re starving for topics?</p><p>Anyway, when the live is open to the public, the rule has it that the students must watch from the monitors installed in the school buildings, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It’s recommended, but not exactly a rule. …Stop hunching over, Sensei; you look pathetic.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Seriously.

One, two, three… so Ba-barrier included, seems like we’re all gathered now.</p><p>Forget rehearsals, we’re gonna have to start the show on the spot, but are you guys okay with that?</p><p>Especially you, Kagehira. Why do you look so tired? Did Kunugi-sensei work you like a horse?</p><p>Everybody~ We got an abusive teacher here!”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Don’t say things that may be taken the wrong way.

Then, is it the correct answer? &lt;HuHu~♪&gt;”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Ah, I’m beat… The costume-making ended up takin’ lots of time no thanks to Oshi-san startin’ to nitpick in the middle.</p><p>Ah, that’s the reason we’re late, by the way!

Hang in there; you’re not ‘acting out’ being an idol, by the way – you are one.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Sure, sure… but seriously, I just have less stamina than you young’uns.</p><p>I took up running too, but I guess I can’t restore everything in just a month.</p><p>The next song will turn the spotlight on you ‘disciples’ so the audience can get to know you. And while leading all the attention on you, I’ll step back and rest for a bit.</p><p>It’s a strategy to keep me from pushing myself too much, hitting a wall halfway, and making a mess of the endgame.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right. You explained before, so we know. I personally want you to hang on from start to finish though.</p><p>We don’t know when you’ll ever get to stand on stage again.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Yeah, why not push yourself to the limit while you have the chance? Won’t it turn out to be a good memory to look back on~?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Now, now. Don’t force Sensei too much. Let’s try to hold on with just us youngsters.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Sagami-sensei’s plenty young too… But well, of course <em>I</em> have to be the one standing out the most. Do your best as my prop, Sensei♪”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Prop… Ahh, so that’s what this is. I think I got it. You’re the same do-gooder as always, Akiyan.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “? What are you mumbling? Anyway, I’m gonna cart off all your old fans, Sensei♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. I’ll have some too as my pay for helping out with Project-Saga.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Sure. I mean, I can’t just say ‘go ahead’ and hand over my fans, but you guys gotta be rewarded for your efforts.</p><p>Really, good work sticking with me for this one month. Thanks, kids.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “We’re only done with the first song – please don’t make it feel like it’s all over.</p><p>The real show… no, the real <em>battle</em> is just about to begin.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I know. A lot of my fans came to see me, more than I imagined.</p><p>And that makes me happy, so I’m gonna work myself just enough to not disappoint those wonderful people.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. You seem to be in a good mood, Sensei. I was worried, you know; it seems you retired after a bitter experience…</p><p>So I thought that maybe it was scary for you to come back to the stage.</p><p>It’s natural to feel scared. You may be a school teacher, much older than us, who’s gone through a lot more than we have…</p><p>But you’re still a human being, so it’s natural to not want to go back to a place that held an awful memory for you.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. To be frank, I was a bit scared. But turns out it was my needless worry. Somehow, I feel like I just got reunited with my first love after many years.</p><p>I was an idol who made my fans fall in love with me, but I wonder who’s actually head over heels for who…</p><p>Uh, is that an outdated expression? Doesn’t click with modern youths?</p><p>… oops. Seems like Ba-barrier’s turn is done. That practice song was supposed to be a short one, anyway.</p><p>We’re gonna prepare for our next song. Sure is busy and a lot of work, eh?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Is that so? Performing interchangeably is the standard for battle-style DreamFests… I’m used to it, and I think so are Hidaka and the rest of the students.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I see; of course… I guess the times have really changed. Various idols are jumbled together.</p><p>Well, I like a field of flowers more than just a huge, pretty flower by itself.</p><p>What you currently have is a lot better. I’m envious, really.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha. Then why not make a real comeback and work again as an idol? From now on, and always!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nope, impossible. My era ended long ago, so I leave the rest to you youths.</p><p>I don’t have enough life in me to start a new love, so I’m gonna be a middle-aged man playing matchmaker for the young’uns.</p><p>…Sounds like a pleasurable way to live out the rest of my life, right?”</p><h3 id="revival-31">Revival / 31</h3><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/jk0cEoI.jpg"></p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “<em>Hello!

It sorta makes me feel rewarded. Thanks a lot… Hero.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “…Sagami-sensei. How exemplary to leave the children to work hard while you rest.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/qJp3sIe.jpg"></p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Hey, that’s how the strategy goes. You’re too uptight; be careful so you won’t get back pain from working too much.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu. If that happens, I’ll have Dr. Sagami treat me. You don’t mind doing that much, of course? I went through a lot for you.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “You went and did that all on your own. …I’m kidding. Thanks a lot.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “My. I didn’t expect the usually bleak person to be so honest. Will it rain…? But I left all my laundry outside to dry.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “It’s not all bad; after a rain, a rainbow will sometimes appear. There’ll be something good as long as you hang onto life… that’s what the brats taught me this time.</p><p>Anyway. So I’m thinking to wrap this up like a nice, pretty story soon, so if you’re hiding something, you better spit it out fast.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Ah, my upperclassman is threatening me. I’m going to tell on you to the teachers, you know?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “…You seem to be in a strangely good mood, Akiyan.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I am. Didn’t I say before? It was my dream to stand on the same stage as you.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “And that’s why you formed Ba-barrier and intruded on this project?</p><p>You’re causing trouble for the kids you got wrapped up in this, you despotic teacher… the Ministry of Education’s gonna sue you.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “It’ll be fine. I’m sure those children will come out of this believing it was a good experience.</p><p>Because I would never invite children who couldn’t think that way; children with no hopes of growth.</p><p>Those children were excluded from the mainstream, either because of their peculiarity, or their sad past…</p><p>But they have talent, so making them experience being normal idols should have some meaning.</p><p>I don’t mind that Kagehira-kun and Harukawa-kun have people they look up to. But no matter how hard they try, they can’t become their admired heroes themselves.</p><p>I’m sure it’s better for them to have more options when they finally notice that fact in the future.</p><p>And there’s Mikejima-kun; he’s so stubborn about his own life’s direction despite being so young.</p><p>I want him to gain a wider perspective. So I thought Ba-barrier would be a good chance to give him that.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “And did you tell the brats directly? It’s 'cause you always play the bad guy that they all misunderstand you… thinking you’re a nasty teacher and all, ya know?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “But that <em>is</em> the job. <em>Our</em> job.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Fair enough. Forming a team with the students and standing on stage with them isn’t what our job is about.</p><p>… really, I wonder why things turned out like this.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I haven’t dug that deep, either. But it seems there is indeed somebody operating behind the scenes, in Project-Saga.</p><p>A conspiracy is really brewing behind all of this.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “…you’re kidding me. Man, this is awful, why does everybody love wargames so much? Shouldn’t singing, dancing, and cheerfully interacting with the fans be enough for idols?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I agree. That’s why, the ones pulling the strings here are mostly people in the position of administrating idols.</p><p>Such as Yumenosaki’s board of directors, and many more… people with power over the industry.</p><p>As a matter of fact, I’m accepting orders from the board. They told me to protect Sagami-sensei with all I have.</p><p>And the order even went as far as stressing that I must become your shield when worst comes to worst.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “As if you’d even make for a decent shield. …huh? Didn’t we have a conversation like this, loong ago?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “We did, indeed. But I’ve aged since then. I’ve become an adult; I’ve amassed life experience and matured, even just a bit…</p><p>So you’ll see that I make for a decent enough shield, Sagami-<em>senpai.</em>”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Right. I see. …Thanks for always, Akiyan.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu. You’re saying a lot of ‘thanks’ today, Jin.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I couldn’t thank people for the love and favors they gave me when I was active… so even if it’s too late, I feel like thanking everybody a lot now.”</p><h3 id="revival-32">Revival / 32</h3><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “All of that aside, what’s this conspiracy? Is it something we can do anything about?</p><p>It’s the powerful people of the industry we’re going up against, yeah? We got stomped pretty easily back in the day though.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/zYX5mnC.jpg"></p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Because you weren’t even motivated. Anyway, I investigated it personally, but I couldn’t grab hold of anything solid.</p><p>The only thing for sure is, soon after this… Project-Saga will undergo a huge update.</p><p>There will be a huge inflow of cash, turning it into a big affair for the industry.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah, I heard something like that too. I see, so it wasn’t just rumors.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Oh? I thought you’d be more surprised. It appears you’re acquainted with somebody informative.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. You know how it goes: heroes never let injustice slide.</p><p>Anyway, if Project-Saga’s going big, isn’t that great? What’s the problem?</p><p>I mean, besides the trouble of me having to shave every time?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Well. First of all, there will be many mentor-disciple units created across the country, as originally planned.</p><p>When a huge investment is made, the people involved will start moving towards their goal.</p><p>While that list from before may not be realized completely, I’m sure quite a lot of retired idols will be willing to take part.</p><p>So will the many agencies and idol training schools across the country.</p><p>Project-Saga will get the whole idol industry wrapped up in it, reborn as a large-scale event.</p><p>Our board of directors would like to make Yumenosaki stand out inside all of that.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Aah, and that’s why they ordered you to protect us.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Yes. It is wretched how desperate they are to cling onto glory of the past and keep up an image, but… I don’t suppose we have the right to say that either.</p><p>Anyway, Project-Saga will cause a huge tide, which naturally means changing the future balance of powers in the idol industry.</p><p>It’ll affect many things, including SS at the end of the year.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Oh-hoh. So if our work in Project-Saga turns out to be worth crap…</p><p>Yumenosaki Academy will be publicly proven to be not up to snuff, affecting our customer traffic and evaluation in the worst ways.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Yes. If we were a joint-stock company, our stock price would be crashing to rock bottom. Not something idols belonging to Yumenosaki Academy can laugh off.</p><p>That’s why it’s necessary to make Rain-bows grow, as you are something of Yumenosaki’s representative for Project-Saga.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “So you came to pick a fight. We would clash, polish each other, and grow…</p><p>'Cause in the present, when no huge investment’s been made yet, Project-Saga’s serialization belongs to just us.</p><p>If we can produce a result – a victory – in this state, we’ll gain high evaluation and kick off to a good start.</p><p>And instead of a solo live, a live battle between units will heat up things better, and make it clearer how well or badly we’re doing.</p><p>So you became props… nah, underdogs. You know I don’t have many good memories about that kind of method.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Nevertheless, it is effective. After repeating it many times, you transformed into a peerless super idol at the end, right?</p><p>I am an old-type idol just like you, so I don’t know any other method.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “You know more than I do. Plus, I feel like you don’t intend to just go down as props…</p><p>You’re seriously coming to wreck us, huh? Especially your kids.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Yes. I deliberated about it myself. About which I should choose…</p><p>Should I act as a prop to hype you up, or kick you down to replace you?</p><p>The children in Ba-barrier are not particularly active in the public eye right now.</p><p>If they replace Rain-bows, I’m sure they can focus entirely on this project.</p><p>But in your group, there is Trickstar’s Hidaka-kun – we’ll leave <em>fine</em>’s Himemiya-kun aside for now…</p><p>And also Ryuuseitai’s Morisawa-kun, who definitely doesn’t have a lot of free time. I’m sure he wants to spend the last year of his high school life without regrets, too.</p><p>Won’t it be difficult for them to give their all for both their original units and Project-Saga?</p><p>As a matter of fact, you have been able to gather only once a week.</p><p>Still, if it is indeed possible, having you all carry on with Project-Saga is the most natural end to this.</p><p>After all, you were specifically named to take the main role.</p><p>Whether it is truly fine for us to steal that role away and replace you…</p><p>And whether it is possible, I don’t know. Of course, if the need calls, I thought to use every strategy possible to make it happen.</p><p>That’s why I decided that I would test you using this live. To see what you all are worth.</p><p>In the end, watching you practice isn’t enough; I have to fight you myself to see—</p><p>I have to <em>feel</em> what you’re capable of, against my skin. Otherwise, I won’t be satisfied. That’s what I thought, so I tried throwing down the glove, despite my age.</p><p><em>If</em> Jin’s natural-born laziness in its full glory has dragged the group down to incompetence… I will fight you, take you down, crush you and replace you.</p><p>And I will participate in Project-Saga in your place. You seem to be worn out with being an idol, anyway…</p><p>So if you are suffering, I thought to take that heavy load off your shoulders.</p><p>Well, my head swirled with such difficult thoughts, but that seemed to be all needless worry – for now. We’re still in the middle of the show, so… I should stop with the presumptions.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Right. My brats are working a lot harder than I gave them credit for. Ahaha, maybe I have what it takes to be a teacher♪”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “&lt;No comment.&gt; …well, your group is proving to be on a higher level than I expected. If you keep this up, I am sure you’ll be fine going forward.</p><p>Though in the first place, if you were to be losing to our hastily-made group, I can’t imagine you competing on even footing with other mentor-disciple groups…</p><p>Plus, the mastermind behind the plot will likely send out their treasured piece to compete in Project-Saga.</p><p>If not, they wouldn’t have invested a large sum of money in it. …Do not let your guard down, or they may eat you up.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “The mastermind who…? Is there really anybody who’d go out of their way plotting such a large-scale scheme in these times?</p><p>Honestly, what with the long winter that froze up the industry, I’d almost want to have the back of a guy with that much fight left in him.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I wonder… I have a guess, but I can’t say anything definite yet.</p><p>I approached Tenshouin-kun and a few others for my investigation too, but this mastermind will not stick out their head at all.</p><p>The enemy is not truly on the move yet. Though looking at how Project-Saga has been progressing, I believe they will show themself of their own accord eventually.</p><p>Please keep your guard up. Let’s both try our hardest so the future of the children won’t be shrouded with dark clouds.</p><p>…oops. So it appears it is our turn next; excuse me as I sing.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Mmkay. … man, you got me~ I ended up chatting around with you because you said something that caught my interest. That’s part of the strategy, huh? Making me waste my part in the show, even if it’s a short one.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu. Can you really survive and win this like that?</p><p>Perhaps you’ve forgotten because you’ve been inactive for so long – idols are all about doing everything to win, you see ♪”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nope. I just remembered, but idols are about loving and being loved.</p><p>That’s what I think. Those who interfere with the love between an idol and their fans – between <em>us</em> and <em>them</em>… will be kicked down to the bottom of Hell.</p><p>Let’s teach that to whoever is behind this conspiracy, yeah?”</p><h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Winter</p><p><strong>&gt; Reimei Academy</strong></p><p>&lt; Approximately half a year later; a week after SS &gt;</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/RmUtCh4.jpg"></p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Jun-kun, Jun-kun!

But that sass is a sign you’ve regained some of your energy, so I’m also glad♪</p><p>Jun-kun, you’ve been looking dejected since what happened in SS…</p><p>I know you’re shocked from the defeat, but let us look at the future anew!

If I’ve been looking sour – sure, it’s partly because of SS, but it’s mostly because of, you know, that Project-Saga thing~?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ah, one of the agency’s… or rather Ibara’s many schemes, huh?</p><p>Unusual of that venomous snake, he hushed up the whole matter <em>very</em> thoroughly just so Jun-kun, and <em>only</em> Jun-kun, wouldn’t find out! Right?</p><p>Well, I was informed of the matter normally…</p><p>So I was laughing inside the whole time you were fuming and cursing at Sagami Jin without a single clue☆”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “…If I were to kill a person, how many years would I have to spend in jail? Maybe it’s on Wik*pedia.</p><p>But I’m a minor, so I won’t get a death sentence, that’s for sure~ Let’s see…”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Come now! Stop fiddling with your smartphone and look at me!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “…&lt;GODDAMN.&gt; Well, I understand why you guys would be hiding that from me.</p><p>If I were to know about Project-Saga, I definitely would’ve chosen that instead of SS.</p><p>I mean, Sagami Jin’s actually participating as an idol for that one, right?</p><p>I’d be able to fight on even footing with him, on a stage… If it was the me from before, I would’ve jumped on the chance watering from the mouth.</p><p>In fact, I’m <em>so</em> itching to join in and thrash that piece of garbage even <em>now</em>, y’know~?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I know. And it <em>is</em> possible to take part – didn’t he say? That’s why we are heading to school so early in the morning on our day off!</p><p>To be accompanying Jun-kun on his personal matter – I’m so selfless!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “If it’s that much trouble for you, just go home~ I’ll do this on my own.</p><p>When I saw Sagami Jin cheering for me during SS, I thought it kinda put me at rest—</p><p>But nope. My life so far has been spent thinking of only him. If I don’t put an end to it myself, I can’t see myself moving on ever~”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ehh~? You should be thinking of only <em>me</em>! Well, it’s rare for Jun-kun to be so fixated on someone… so it has piqued some of my curiosity too♪</p><p>It’s been such a long while since I last did work unrelated to Eden or Eve, so I’m looking forward to it.</p><p>I wonder what our other members are like? A new meeting means the beginning of a new happiness♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Who knows… We’re gonna go meet them now.

I’d take anyone but my old man.</p><p>The one with any connection to Sagami Jin is the old man, not me, so he’ll probably happily join if we ask,</p><p>but I prefer to just let him retire for good, ya know~?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I’m not sure; I’m quite interested in meeting your father, Jun-kun♪</p><p>… but for some reason Ibara, and even <em>that</em> Nagisa-kun gave quite strange reactions when they heard of this matter.</p><p>It’s just a feeling, but I think there may be an unbelievable trump card prepared.</p><p>In fact, that will make it more interesting if it’s true!

Because I’m a big fan of yours, Sagami-senpai♪”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay… but work has been killing me these last few days and I’m dead tired right now. Feels like I’m gonna fall asleep anytime now.</p><p>I think I’ll just show up for the stage at the end to at least fulfill my duty…</p><p>So can you tell the Ryuuseitai guys to hang on by themselves?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Eh~? Please say such things in person instead of having other people pass on the message.</p><p>Why do you look so worn out? You’re still young, so please hang in there♪”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nah, I’m pretty much an old coot by this point… Lately kids a lot younger than me, especially girls, have started making appearances on TV.</p><p>And I mean the type of kids you’d still see with a backpack until a while ago. They’d be saying ‘Let’s both do our best♪’ with the face of a working adult…</p><p>Boy, it’s like we’re ‘playing house’.</p><p>I start thinking it’s dumb to take this job so seriously. Really.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Ahaha. It seems you are worn out body and mind, Sagami-senpai.</p><p>…If that’s the problem, I think you can take breaks from jobs you have no passion for.</p><p>Personally, I wish for Sagami-senpai to sparkle on top of a stage always.</p><p>But it definitely isn’t worth destroying your body over.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “And you’re my what, Akiyan…? You got a lot of free time, huh. Stop chasing after me and work harder for yourself.</p><p>I’d have less burdens if everyone else also put in the effort and made a name for themselves. I’m the only one being forced to slave away right now; it makes no sense.</p><p>The times have come that even brats who only know how to crawl get thrust into the limelight. The business has a serious shortage of hands.</p><p>It’s almost painful to see. Normally, don’t kids that age feel the happiest frolicking around with their school friends?</p><p>But they’re being made to work around the clock, spending grey-colored youths.</p><p>Maybe they’ve been made to believe that it <em>is</em> their youth – but me, I just feel pity.</p><p>I mean… they’re just getting exploited until they wear away like erasers, and they’ll be thrown away by the end of it.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah… Sorry 'bout that, Akiyan. I always seem to wind up whining when I see you.</p><p>You’re one of those who see dreams in idols, so I bet you don’t like to hear this kind of reality check.</p><p>Sorry, sorry. Why don’t we talk about something fun? Just a while ago, there was this really sexy lady who started stripping outta nowhere while I was singing on stage–”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Sagami-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Eh, what? Sorry, you’re prim and proper so… I guess sexy topics are out too?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “There’s a rainbow.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Rainbow? Ah… you’re right. How many years has it been since I last took a good look at a rainbow? Stars and sunsets too; they get hard to notice when you’re busy.</p><p>Do rainbows always look like that? Looks pretty blurry to me.</p><p>You think there’s really seven colors? God definitely got lazy and skipped out on a few colors there… One, two, three?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu. Speaking of, you’re Ryuusei Rainbow, aren’t you, Sagami-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn? Yeah, actually, they asked ‘What color would you like?’ when I helped out at Ryuuseitai, but…</p><p>When I said I’d be fine with whatever’s left, that somehow got me rainbow.</p><p>I’m kinda being sold as the manly and simple type, so I don’t think rainbows suit me.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Really? I think it’s the perfect color for you~ Super Idol Sagami Jin, releasing seven-colored shines…☆</p><p>…even moreso since it feels like you’ll disappear if I take my eyes off you.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ Did you say something? You’re a loud guy for the most part, so it’s hard to catch what you’re saying when you suddenly drop your voice…</p><p>Sorry to ask, but can you say that one more time, if it was important?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “No, never mind. It’s nothing, really.</p><p>You know, I like rainbows. When the gloomy, cloudy sky clears, a seven-colored bridge forms across it as if to bless the end of the rain…</p><p>It’s like a miracle. So I think it suits you, Sagami-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I wonder about that… As you can see, I’m more a cloudy sky type of person, aren’t I?”</p><h2 id="roundabout">Roundabout</h2><h3 id="roundabout-1">Roundabout / 1</h3><p><strong>&gt; 2-A Classroom</strong></p><p>&lt; Present time, spring.

Feel free to ask me anything you don’t understand.</p><p>Nn? <em>Thanks for always</em>? What are you saying? I’m the class rep… It’s my responsibility to look after you, as you’re a transfer student.</p><p>Our homeroom teacher told me to do so too.</p><p>Plus, our revolution succeeded thanks to you. I owe you, and a lifetime won’t be enough to repay it.</p><p>I’ll do anything for you… Grandma told me to never become an ingrate.</p><p>Fufu. Happenings have been rolling in like a storm since you transferred…</p><p>Neither of us have had much breathing space, but now that things have calmed down some, we can finally catch a break.</p><p>For the time being, I believe you should slow down and get used to life at Yumenosaki.</p><p>Even if it may be too late to say that. But you <em>are</em> a transfer student – you probably haven’t fully adapted yet.</p><p>You guided us to victory in DDD a while back, and achieved high evaluation in your capability as a producer.</p><p>You’ve become highly sought for, so you’re probably busy.</p><p>But that’s why you shouldn’t be hasty; consider your options carefully before taking action. I’ll answer to you with my all if you seek a word of advice or assistance, so feel free to count on me.</p><p>Not just me; Akehoshi, Yuuki… and Isara, I’m sure they feel the same. We’re comrades. I would be happy if we can continue to support each other like this.</p><p>I’m counting on you, Transfer student.</p><p>…♪ (<em>shakes hands with Anzu satisfiedly</em>)”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ooi, Transfer student, you there?

In the middle of something <em>fun</em>, eh Hocchan? The young’uns have it so nice… I’ll pretend I didn’t see anything, so take your time♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Wait. Stop getting weird ideas. We were only verifying our friendship.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Oh what… you guys are so boring. You’re both still in your adolescence, why not try to have a good time every once in a while?</p><p>And not just by stirring up a storm over taking down the stuco or revolutions.</p><p>If you don’t play around more while young, the regret will come back to bite you when you’re old.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Huh… Is that a warning based on experience, Sagami-sensei?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nope, more like nonsense I’d normally grumble over drinks. Anyway, class rep, can I borrow the transfer student for a minute?</p><p>Why are you here anyway? The transfer student is the only one on class duty, right?</p><p>Class duties are supposed to be done in pairs, but she doesn’t get a partner because she transferred later – am I wrong?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, but it’s a lot of work to do alone… and I thought since she just transferred, she may not be used to class duties, that’s why I’m helping out.</p><p>Trickstar’s on a break period, too, and I have nothing else to do.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Hmm, I see. You guys just finished with SakuraFes, after all. Man, that was fun. Had a session of flower viewing while drinking myself wasted.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t get wasted; have some shame… Your old fans will cry if they see you now, Sagami-sensei.</p><p>Anyway, what do you need her for? I’m just repeating myself but I have nothing else to do – I can help, depending on what you’re asking.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ooh, too much of a good boy, as ever. You must’ve gotten a great education at Hidaka-san’s place…</p><p>Then you come too. You’ll be enough help just by hearing me out and sharing your opinion.</p><p>I retired ages ago. I’ve forgotten how it feels to work in the field.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…? I’m not sure, but I’ll accompany her there, then. Do you mind, Transfer Student?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Right, then come over later, you two. Don’t forget to lock up. See you~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…What was that about, really?</p><p>That good-for-nothing teacher went out of his way to look for you… I have a feeling that it’s pretty important, but I’m not sure.</p><p>I’ve known him for a pretty long time, but I still don’t know what goes on in his head.</p><p>…Mmn? Yeah, Sagami-sensei is on pretty close terms with my parents. They’re very sweet to him, apparently, so he often dropped by our house to play when I was small.</p><p>Sagami-sensei and my dad were both super idols who dominated their eras… so they could probably connect in some way;</p><p>a way that’s still beyond my imagination.</p><p>Fufu, the Sagami-sensei of those days was so cool. I even admired him somewhat.</p><p>Not that there’s any trace of that anymore.</p><p>Oops, we should stop chatting around. Let’s lock up and head to the faculty office. You haven’t forgotten anything, have you, Transfer Student?”</p><h3 id="roundabout-2">Roundabout / 2</h3><p><strong>&gt; Faculty Office</strong></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Excuse us.</p><p>So?

Oh well… Will you two sit down on this sofa?</p><p>I’ll get some drinks. Tea or coffee?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’ll take tea. You should have tea too, Sensei. Not beer.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Even I wouldn’t drink in the faculty office~ I don’t wanna get chewed out by the big guns.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Heh, so even Sagami Jin the Super Idol has aged. Didn’t you use to clash blades with the top brass to correct the rotten side of the entertainment industry, when you were active?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “That’s why I was made to quit… Well, it was mainly my own fault, actually.</p><p>You guys have been kicking up a fuss over revolution and what-not too, but I say that if you can’t beat them, you better join them.</p><p>Those bigwigs can crush you easily if you get on their bad side.</p><p>Well, whatever I say, I doubt you’d listen. I guess that’s youth for you…</p><p>But make sure to keep out of trouble, okay? Cleaning up after you is a pain.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. We’re sorry for adding to your burdens, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “It’s okay~… At the end of the day, it <em>is</em> my role as a teacher – nah, as an adult.</p><p>Anyway, sorry for calling you two all the way here. Will you do some things for me?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, that’s what we came for. Like I said before, I’m pretty free; I can do you the favor of helping with what I can, I suppose.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I think it’s not my imagination that you sound uppity, Hocchan… but I should expect as much from the son of His Majesty the King who rules over our entertainment world.</p><p>I dunno how Hidaka-san does it, still so active and hanging on even now.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Even my father doesn’t make as many appearances as he used to, though. He was grumbling about not having enough life left in him anymore.</p><p>On the other hand, Mother gains more energy the older she becomes. What a pain in the neck.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Do <em>not</em> call your parent a pain in the neck. Are you rebellious or what?</p><p>…Boy, we went off on a royal tangent there. Anyway, I’m relieved that you’re willing to help out.</p><p>To be frank with you, I’ve no idea what to do by myself.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Are you fine like that? It’s your role as a teacher to teach and guide your students, isn’t it?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, kids often get the wrong idea, but we teachers – adults in general really – aren’t omnipotent gods, okay?</p><p>Either way… we’re going nowhere like this, so I’ll get down to business.</p><p>Transfer Student. If it’s alright with you, I want you to produce me.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…</p><p>I never thought you’d stoop so low, Sagami Jin.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Eh? What’s up with that face as if you’re looking at a pest? I don’t get what ticks youngsters off…!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You disappoint me. I can’t believe you so <em>shamelessly</em> said that you want her to <em>produce</em> you…</p><p>You want her to take care of you for life, in other words? <em>Marry</em> you?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “You have some really weird misunderstandings sometimes, Hocchan… Nah, nah, I was an old-type idol so I don’t get married.</p><p>I’m simply asking her to produce me as an idol like she’s doing for the other guys.</p><p>There’s no other producer in Yumenosaki right now, so the transfer student’s the only one I can ask.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…As an – idol? You’re coming back, Sagami-sensei?</p><p>That’s great news. I was a passionate fan of yours, as a child.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No, no, it’ll be a temporary comeback… I got handed a pretty troublesome job, you see.</p><p>I don’t intend to ever become an idol again, and I don’t think anyone wants me to.</p><p>But the one asking is my benefactor, who picked me up when I was running away after retirement.</p><p>That person was the reason I get to act like a somewhat-proper working member of society like now.</p><p>I’d been in his care quite a lot during my active days too, so I want to repay the favor.</p><p>He’s this huge magnate with a lot of power over magazine companies and such, you see. When I got into a scandal, he defended me all on his own.</p><p>I see him like my other dad. He’s very old, constantly bedridden, but he came to me and lowered his head for this, claiming it to be his ‘last wish’.</p><p>No way I could refuse <em>that</em>. If you ask me, I’m more of a lowlife and a good-for-nothing, and I’ve no intention to act like a good kid so late in life, but…</p><p>If I were to crush the dying wish of such a good person underfoot, there’d really be no value in my having been born. Better strangle myself to death on the spot.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “That’s how it is, so I’m being pretty serious here, for <em>once</em>. My life’s been pretty much like dregs, but this could be its last major topic.</p><p>You guys don’t have to think about it so heavily, though.</p><p>Just like what I’ve been doing for you – you can lend me a hand with what you can do, when you feel like it.”</p><h3 id="roundabout-3">Roundabout / 3</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Project-Saga?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah, a project by that name is just starting to move, it seems. Majestic name, don’t you think?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m more bothered that the name tells me nothing about the content. What is it about? Land development project for the Saga Prefecture?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “What the heck.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Splendid, Super Idol Sagami Jin.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No idea what that praise is for… but anyway, I’ve been made the center of that program. By the recommendation of a certain bigwig, as I was saying.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. So to be more specific, what is the project about?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay, the content kind of loses out to the name, but it’s a low-budget project that’ll be carried out on a magazine, mostly.</p><p>The bigwig I was saying about, he still has power over many things even now, but he retired a long time ago. Seems like he doesn’t wanna meddle with the business too much and consequently make a mess there.</p><p>So we’ll do things discreetly, in a corner. It’s gonna be embarrassing if we stand out too much but fail, so I do prefer it this way.</p><p>The point of this project is to revive past idols who have retired.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Sagami-sensei, for example. Hmm, hence the title Project-Saga… taken from the name ‘Sagami’.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “And from the word ‘saga’… meaning heroic epic, apparently. Heroes? What heroes? It sounds so shameless and silly.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, I think you were as a matter of fact a hero of the entertainment world.</p><p>When a long winter had frozen the industry, you restored the life it lost even if temporarily, didn’t you?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ Maybe for a moment. But then again, the current youth don’t have that much energy either, so I guess they wanna toss me out there again to buck up the industry?</p><p>Your generation’s got a force to look forward to, but it still hasn’t reached the industry’s core…</p><p>So they need a stopgap until you guys are fully matured.</p><p>This plan is prolly that temporary measure.</p><p>The bigwig’s got a lot of life left in him, talking about resuscitating a legend, ‘Decree of the Restoration of Imperial Rule!’ and what-not…</p><p>But I think the guys still actively working in the field don’t expect that much from the project.</p><p>Great haul if it succeeds, but no problem if it fails. Any criticism or scandal isn’t gonna hurt or tickle me at this point either.</p><p>That’s about how much this loose plan amounts to.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… I feared for the worst since you got all serious, but it doesn’t sound like such a big project.</p><p>Though personally, if they’re going to revive you, I think they should make a far bigger deal of it.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nah, I’ve got no energy for that anymore.</p><p>If they’re gonna pour money on someone, the younger generations like you guys should be priority. Investing on <em>me</em> this late into the game isn’t gonna bear any fruit.</p><p>Well anyway, so they’re gonna temporarily revive all the once-famous idols across the country, starting with me.</p><p>I saw the list, and it’s full of famous artists everyone has heard the name of.</p><p>Well, they’re only gonna start proposing the plan to the other idols now, so I think we won’t have the exact same members as in the plan, by the end of this.</p><p>They all retired long ago and became common people, after all.</p><p>It’s absurd to kick old men’s butts and expect them to actually go on stage. I don’t wanna either, I’m just gonna disappoint my old fans.</p><p>So these ‘Legendary Idols’… says the project proposal.</p><p>These retired old coots will be grouped with two to three young kids.</p><p>So that in the worst case if we Legendary Idols end up being a waste of resources, the young artists can work hard to put up an appearance, at least…</p><p>Or that’s what I believe the project leader is thinking.</p><p>So, the deal is, we Legendary Idols get positioned as mentors, while the young artists with future potential… become disciples for us to raise.</p><p>They wanna write a master-disciple story like often seen in <em>shounen manga</em>, I take it.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. I don’t read <em>manga</em>, so I have no idea. So they have that kind of cliche.</p><p>Then you’re perfect for it, Sagami-sensei. You <em>are</em> presently a teacher, even if a lousy one.</p><p>You’re already in the position of a ‘mentor’.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah, I bet they got the idea from my occupation~ This plan’s almost sickeningly tailored to center on me.</p><p>Talk about annoying. The commissioner probably had the wrong idea about me…</p><p>When I told him I’m a teacher, he shed manly tears and went all ‘You’ve grown up so much, Jin-kun!’ on me, y’know.”</p><h3 id="roundabout-4">Roundabout / 4</h3><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, that’s how it is, so as a ‘Legendary Idol’, I’ll need to take a few disciples under my wing.</p><p>I was thinking to call out to whoever looks like they have a lot of free time.</p><p>But would you like to do it, Hocchan?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… I can’t make a decision right away, but I <em>am</em> interested. It depends on the working hours, the reward, and what experiences I’ll gain, though.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah, expect to be paid chicken feed. I said this is a low-budget plan, didn’t I?</p><p>But if we can convince the student council, the academy may be willing to pay more on the side.</p><p>If possible, I want to leave the job of such negotiations to you, Transfer Student. And I want your cooperation for a bunch of other things, actually… as a producer.</p><p>I have my day job as a teacher, so I can’t pour that much time into Project-Saga.</p><p>To be honest, it’s such a pain in the butt. I’d dump the whole deal on the transfer student if I could.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Why do you have so little motivation, Sagami-sensei…? And the transfer student’s still not used to the academy, so stop giving her more burdens.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, you don’t have to work too hard for it. I just need your help with what you can do, and when you feel like it.</p><p>It’s a low-budget plan with no stress, so it’s not gonna hurt your work history if it fails.</p><p>In fact, I think it’ll be good practice for any actual producer work you’ll be doing in the future.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You can reject him, Transfer student. From what I’ve heard, it’ll bear too little fruit to justify the time and effort you’ll have to put in.</p><p>Time is finite, so it’s wiser to spend it focusing on matters of more importance.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yup. He’s not wrong about that. Until you came, we teachers were in charge of the producer-like jobs, and we still are, actually.</p><p>I <em>can</em> deal with it on my own, for the most part.</p><p>Take it home with you and think it through at your own pace. I got the proposal copied, so I’ll hand one each to you two.</p><p>If you’ve decided to help, or not help, you can quietly come up to me after homeroom or something.</p><p>Also, if you can introduce me to anyone who looks like they’d be interested in Project-Saga, that’ll help me a bunch.</p><p>I need around two or three kids to become my disciples, after all.</p><p>By the way, the commissioner wants to spread the age of the disciples apart, I heard.</p><p>It isn’t a must, but ideally, we’d like one person from the first year, second year, and third year each.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. That’s a weird request to make. What’s the meaning in spreading the ages?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No idea… The Legendary Idols are varied in age too, so the young guys being all of the same generation will make it seem unbalanced, I think?</p><p>The commissioner said having representatives from various generations will portray the history of idols more comprehensively or something… a knotty reasoning of that line.</p><p>Well, it sounded like tall tales so I just let it in one ear and out the other.</p><p>But I’m thinking since you’re all the same age in Trickstar, it’ll be good to let you interact more with the other grades.</p><p>Even just one year’s gap can result in huge differences, and I bet it’ll be good stimulation.</p><p>Of course, I dunno yet if you will or won’t take the offer.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… Well, I’ll consider.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay, think it through for me~ You guys can go home now. Sorry to keep you.</p><p>If you don’t understand anything about the proposal while reading, you can ring me and ask. I’ll give you my number too, Transfer Student.</p><p>You know, it doesn’t have to have anything to do with Project-Saga – you can gimme a call if you need something, anything. I <em>am</em> your homeroom teacher.</p><p>If a boy sexually harasses you, call me ASAP. You’re surrounded by dudes in the heat of their youth and all~ I’m so worried for your purity.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Except <em>your</em> words already constitute as sexual harassment, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dLI16JtOa_T65NZeegpw-T5bmHbVP94V0qj9BpjORywus-478DMDYY6qeg8zxbJTloPC8Gw9geexXB77Mij5grBAgtmnQNl9DkciGq5Cy84vpvMwlUgqOP42ZShl9TMBK7IiCixjiUv2qqx_svxXt1NJUotEL6FaaHz3RpntO9BARs0tcQcT2O3bbB9ngbqM0IsOwAJp86mdyQBaUSs32obGNkMq6obWprK5lCfmXBt5gHWC4lisPVIIoXHbyUqKiV2_AxTxICN-k1erKAs4koNIdn94U8dVcueEyRdf2tB7f15HiciYuvDGCkxAyx_UEELltEcFqDeubWsbHWg-f6IDb9eSNRhNnK6js0xChukZGbhqMn5pko8tXfojoJMEUsDX6tQNKdvW3e6z3HAVZ3SD4UUVLLvpSnAj8RT4iZmkBsc9TQdO8GnvTIBoyo8ahsOVWaiDo7ScJnbY7QERWtTrSBX_3rZDAeUWCluG85loSX5BIXRpxWbNNkOAVGDMhkHFhcGM6WNvGVrlVxm63F2LcBXOsnFDTAOvNnSXc1Ye2EB7BTDBhDeqdkCmt4lb7JS5h6h8Tqv1gCeXIh_hu07B5k3xFq4YYkJUQHvVEfXIhccsuL-BFQmAFBf7tdw6G6fj7W1PUvZ_d5O1Nh54Hy1UBtyAMFiFS3tgnu2oZ9LT=w1136-h640-no"></p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “…Oh?

Then I need to find a first year and a third year next.</p><p>Unfortunately, I’m not too familiar with students from the other year levels… I’ve neither an idea nor a mark on where to look.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Oh… So they’re recruiting a kind of ‘representative player’ from each grade, huh?</p><p>How about the Light Music Club?

But he added a favorable response at the end, saying that if I <em>really</em> insist, he’d be willing to reconsider in exchange of a personal belonging of yours, Yuuki.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yup! That’s why I tried to steal your personal belonging – your glasses – before this!</p><p>That’s the entire story!

But the reality is that Sena-senpai… or the entire Knights are still in a steep situation.</p><p>I think he meant that as a subtle rejection, so there’s probably little hope he’d help me out with Project-Saga.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No, I mean it – I <em>really</em> advise against taking him, okay~?</p><p>If Izumi-san joins Project-Saga, it’s possible that he’ll hang around Hidaka-kun a lot under the pretext of discussing the project, right?</p><p>I’m going to skip school?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That would be trouble. Hmm… but I really have no idea on who to ask. Must I really seek the Light Music Club’s – Sakuma-senpai and the twins’ – help?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hey hey. That Project-Saga thingy’s going to center on Sagami-chan, right?</p><p>Then how about asking Chii-chan-senpai? He’s said many times that he’s a big fan of Sagami-chan, even when no one was asking.</p><p>If he joins Project-Saga then on top of it helping Sagami-chan, he’ll get the chance to study under him as a disciple, right?</p><p>I think he’ll be very thrilled to accept, maybe♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm? Chii-chan… senpai? Who?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ryuuseitai’s Red-and-Annoying Morisawa Chiaki-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Aah, that person. We’ve never really spoken; so he’s Sagami-sensei’s fan, huh.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yup. Sagami-chan appeared in a tokusatsu movie in the past or something…</p><p>Chii-chan-senpai loves that stuff, so he’s been a passionate fan since the movie aired, or so he says.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. I see; he sounds like the perfect person for this. If I recall correctly, he’s the leader of Ryuuseitai, so he’s definitely pretty busy,</p><p>but I want to try asking anyway.

He’s a strong boy.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Not everyone is as strong as you, Mikejima-san.

Have some restraint, Mikejima-san.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. I’m helping someone out, though. There’s a bakery in the neighborhood worried about the recent slump in sales, you see. So I’m selling their commodity in their place.</p><p>The school store has gotten fancier in their product line-up, and that’s put the other stores in the neighborhood at a disadvantage.</p><p>When one goes up, the other goes down. That’s the law of nature.</p><p>When one person laughs, another cries. And I can’t stand the guys currently laughing. That’s why I’m siding with those who are crying. Got any problem with that?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…No. Not if that’s your justice, Mikejima-san.</p><p>Rather than that – Mikejima-san, will you be flying to another country soon?

This way, you can warn me <em>and</em> ask something from me at the same time! Nice judgment!</p><p>Okay, let’s hear out this request of yours, Chiaki-san!</p><p>You’re a good person. Acting as you want me to will allow even someone like me to seem like an ally of justice.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “You’re already a ‘hero of justice’ on your own, Mikejima-san. You were the only one worthy enough to introduce yourself as such in the old Ryuuseitai.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “You think too highly of me… Ah well, I’m planning to stay in the country for some time.</p><p>What do you want me to do? I’ll answer within my power.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right, well, I think it’s weird to ask this from you when you’ve resigned from Ryuuseitai, but…</p><p>Will you look after the Ryuuseitai kids every now and then?</p><p>I want you to give them guidance when I’m not around.</p><p>Kanata and I are the only seniors in Ryuuseitai right now, and Kanata doesn’t seem used to dealing with the kids yet.</p><p>So I want to leave them in the hands of someone I can trust. I can’t look after them all the time; there’ll definitely be times I have to take sick breaks and such.</p><p>Even today, an underclassman asked to meet up with me.</p><p>I’ll have to set aside time for him after school. So I need someone else to substitute for me, when things like this happen.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hmm? Should you really trust me? But if you ask whether I can or can’t, it’ll be the former.</p><p>I <em>can</em> give guidance to the kids, and I don’t dislike caring for people. If you really insist, I’ll take responsibility for the kids and protect them during your absence, Chiaki-san.</p><p>But I can’t praise your thinking. I’m somewhat at odds with Ryuuseitai, and both the student council and the teaching staff keep a watchful eye on me.</p><p>If I get involved, it’s likely that I’ll end up being trouble for Ryuuseitai.</p><p>Instead of asking me, you should wake Kanata-san to his duty as an upperclassman and get him to work…</p><p>Or ask others completely unrelated to Ryuuseitai.</p><p>Even if it isn’t a third year, you can ask the teachers or the producer of fame.</p><p>There’s a meaning in my acting as a solo unit, so I actually prefer to not mingle with groups too much.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm… A ‘lone hero’ may have a cool ring to it, but don’t you get lonely?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “I do. People don’t believe me when I say this, but I love humans.</p><p>Well, maybe that’s fair. I couldn’t protect those precious to me at the important time, and let them die – so I don’t have the right to love.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…I don’t think Kanata blames you, Mikejima-san.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “No. Even if that’s true, this is my way of taking ‘responsibility’.</p><p>Oops, I’ve left my customers waiting.</p><p>I’ll think your request through, so you should go back to class before lunch break ends… honor student.</p><p>Walk down the right path, Hero.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yes… You should show up for class too, Mikejima-san. Everyone’s worried about you.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha.

Humans and machines are the same – they rust away if they go on not in service nor maintained for a long time.</p><p>In fact, it would be unnatural if you could function like the presently active children or better in that state.</p><p>No matter that you were once a peerless prodigy.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “You make so much of me, huh? My times were the winter of the idol industry – a rare period of bad harvest…</p><p>That’s the only reason I stood out.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “The modesty. Anyway, work hard for a little longer instead of throwing in the towel so soon.</p><p>Regressed you may have, but you were Sagami Jin the Super Idol. You will eventually recall the knack of it if you continue.</p><p>No – that’s the reason you sought my company and started doing lessons, right? You must be thankful, as I don’t have so much free time myself.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Right, right. You’re a lifesaver, Kunugi-sensei. I’ll treat you to a drink later.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “No need. Alcohol isn’t good for health, and I’m personally happy that you’re making a comeback as an idol.</p><p>…Even if I can’t wipe away the question of ‘<em>why now</em>?’ since so much time has passed.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I explained it to you already. There’s a low-budget plan named Project-Saga which is about reviving past idols.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Yes, and I’m happy about that. Male idols generally have a long career in the industry, like Hidaka-daisenpai…</p><p>So I’ve always thought that you retired too early.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Same with you. Anyway, you talk about a long career, but it’s more that the old men are being made to work because there’s no one else to replace them.</p><p>It’s not good to be stealing the limelight from the youngsters. The world is moving forward.</p><p>So the entertainment industry gotta renew their lineup too. …not that I care about where it’s heading after all this time.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Why are you a teacher at an idol training school, then?</p><p>You had other options – choose a different job, build a family, and become one with the common people.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I hate that term, the <em>common</em> people~ Then what are idols? Gods? Objects of faith to be looked up at and worshiped from the distance?”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Hmm… something lower, I believe. Like slaves.</p><p>During our times, we didn’t have the freedom to work or marry – no, there was a pressure disapproving of such choices.</p><p>Ah… this isn’t good at all. I’m growing to whine more with age.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahaha. It’s okay, it’s okay. Kunugi-sensei’s still young by society’s standards.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “So are you. …You just diverted the topic, didn’t you, Sagami-sensei?</p><p>If you no longer have an attachment to showbiz and idols, then why do you remain in this kind of place?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nah, other lines of occupation just wouldn’t take me, is all.</p><p>I gave my entire youth to being an idol; that’s all I devoted myself to, and I learned nothing else.</p><p>I’m valuable as crap. All I had to do when young was to give my all for what’s in front of me, but I regret that a little now.</p><p>I wish I’d played around more, studied other things.</p><p>I learned at my family’s hospital once, but the experience isn’t enough to allow me to become a proper doctor this late…</p><p>I have my connections and people’s pity to thank for allowing me to become the school doctor I am.</p><p>Well, I have the savings built up from my idol work, so I could’ve played around till I’m dead without lifting a finger for work, really.</p><p>But I’m gonna run to waste if I don’t meet with people at all~</p><p>I actually secluded myself for a bit after retirement; it felt like I aged overnight.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Fufu. Despite looking annoyed when people bother you, you start longing for company if we leave you alone… A troublesome person you are, goodness.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “What are people if not troublesome? Even if human resources that carry out their role endlessly like robots may be preferable as workforce.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “The times have changed, you know. The world is moving in a new direction.</p><p>This is about another school, but there’s a student who manages various companies despite their young age, and many more.</p><p>The future of the children is broader and freer than we may think.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Huh, a high school CEO – sounds like a little kid playing house. Too much has changed, this old man can’t keep up with the times anymore.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Now, now… don’t say that. Let’s try hard for a little longer. I have your back, Jin.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “…Thanks a bunch, Akiyan.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Don’t mention it. And stop idling around; let’s make better use of the time we have. I’ll restart the lesson, Sagami-sensei.</p><p>You need to at least restore some of the ability you had at your peak.</p><p>You’ve always acted like you’re better than the kids, as their teacher. Surely you’d like to save face?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Right, that’s why I asked you to hold a lesson for me. You gotta join me every now and then, after this too. I’ll do something to thank you later.</p><p>Practicing solo is nice and all, but I’ll <em>definitely</em> end up skipping if I’m on my own.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “You’re a lazybones, after all. I wonder where you found the resolve to partake in this project – even if it was a plea from your benefactor.”</p><h3 id="roundabout-12">Roundabout / 12</h3><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Umm, the originator of this project is <em>that</em> magazine company magnate, right?</p><p>I thought he’d decided to retire completely to spend his old days in peace, but there seems to be a lot of life left in his aged body.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. Talked with him a few times, and he sounded pretty full of vigor still.</p><p>And here I was worried because he asked me to ‘grant his last wish’ and stuff.</p><p>…You were prolific as a model, so you know the magazine industry better than I do, don’t you?</p><p>Are we actually playing a dangerous game here? It’s smelling fishy at some places, y’see.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “I wonder. I’m a traitor who turned against the magazine industry and the modeling world…</p><p>Even if there is some hidden intent, no one there likes me enough to tell me.</p><p>In fact, since I caused quite a mess there, I fear for the children. What if they’re bearing the brunt of my actions?</p><p>People seeing them and thinking, '<em>Aah, it’s a Yumenosaki kid. Must be Kunugi’s student, then.’</em></p><p>'<em>Then, they’re probably going to turn on us like Kunugi did’</em>—and such.</p><p>That’s why I think I shouldn’t get too close with the children currently active in modeling.</p><p>…or am I being too self-conscious?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nah. It’s true that people drag out grudges and hard feelings longer than you expect.</p><p>There are guys who’ve never quit bugging me even after I retired.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Ah, you mean that person who sent you a ‘cursed video’ in this day and age? In the end, what was that?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Who knows… it creeps me out so I don’t think too deeply about it. I asked Hasumi to burn the so-called cursed video for me.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Hmm. What was the name of the underdog who appeared in that video?</p><p>Have you contacted him? He <em>is</em> still alive… isn’t he?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Underdog, he says… Nah, why’d you expect me to contact him?</p><p>If he had nothing to do with it, then I’d be a nuisance just by bringing up the topic. And if he turns out to be the culprit, I don’t even wanna converse with him.</p><p>…but y’know, his name is in the list of retired idols planned to be invited to join Project-Saga.</p><p>The rotten business exploited him and he was stuck as the ‘eternal second place’ since I debuted…</p><p>But he was still a pretty famous idol, with a history of success behind him.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Oh. Then it may become a long-awaited reunion for the both of you.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “God, spare me… I don’t have the face to meet him after all this time. I mean, how could I? It’s not like we have pretty memories to recollect either.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “But he was a rival of Sagami Jin the Super Idol.</p><p>People may be fired up to see your long-awaited reunion and rematch.</p><p>I was a fan as well, so I’d <em>love</em> to see it – it’ll be a nice trip down memory lane.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, it’s basically a project for middle-aged people and above to take a nostalgia trip. Rubbish…</p><p>I’m sure the old coots would be thrilled to see that ‘old rivals’ face-off’ if it actually happens,</p><p>But plans are no more than plans. We dunno yet how many retirees are willing to come back for this low-budget project.</p><p>I mean, a look at the list made me laugh, y’know? Felt like some little kid’s ‘<em>original list, don’t steal!</em>’ deal.</p><p>Made me feel that probably, the list wasn’t made by that magnate, but the hard work of a young kid who got ordered to put it together by their boss.</p><p>There was Hidaka-san’s name when he isn’t even retired, and ‘that Akehoshi’ who can’t possibly return to idol work anymore.</p><p>Whichever kid wrote it probably just copied down what he saw in some idol encyclopedia.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Eh – <em>that man</em> is alive!?</p><p>To have Jin on stage with Hidaka-daisenpai and Akehoshi-senpai would make for a true all-star cast of dreams.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No, he’s deceased. The showbiz killed – nah, <em>all</em> of us let him die.</p><p>We loved an idol together and strangled him to death together.</p><p>…We can’t romanticize that, nor pretend it ‘never happened’.</p><p>With the fact that a sinless man died there, any love, dream, and hope that showbiz promotes just sounds like hypocrisy.</p><p>It’s all like a bad joke. A bunch of horseshit.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “But shunning what our predecessors worked hard to build, simply due to a single tragedy…</p><p>…would be what true insincerity – futility – is like, wouldn’t it?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Idols have always been a gamble, an exercise in futility. The white-collar workers working to the bone out there are the better guys, they contribute more to society.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Why is your outlook so bleak…? Well, I guess you can’t help that. But will you be fine like that, ‘Sagami-senpai’?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Who cares. I just gotta save face until the project ends. My duty ends, I step down again.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Ahaha. Well, thank you for the hard work, then. …You have absolutely no intention to make a real comeback, I take it?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “I didn’t retire for nothing; I doubt anyone still wishes to see me there. This is such a weird project. I just hope there’s really no hidden agenda…”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Hmm, if you’re really bothered, should I pull a few strings to see what I can dig up?</p><p>My relation with magazine companies is hopeless, but I do have a bigger network with industry people than you do…</p><p>A new fact may come to light if I probe a little.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~… I don’t think it’s anything that big, but it’d help if you could look into it whenever you’re free.</p><p>We gotta avoid causing trouble for the brats, after all.</p><p>A~ah… Why did things turn out like this? I’m getting lazy.”</p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Don’t say that. For the first time in a long while, this is a story with you in the main role.

Tomoya was my last hope, but he… or rather Ra*bits just seemed very busy.</p><p>Their achievement in DDD gave them the boost they needed to take themselves to the next step.</p><p>This is an important time for them. I’d feel sorry to dump an extra worry on him by getting him involved in this job.</p><p>That’s what I thought, seeing the excited looks on those kids.</p><p>Ra*bits seemed to be having a lot of fun, doing lessons while arguing over this-and-that.</p><p>It’s a good thing. Almost enviable, because you wouldn’t think to see such a sight last year…</p><p>If those children can now enjoy their life as idols with smiles, I can believe that we didn’t rebel against the academy for nothing.</p><p>Like our efforts paid off. …But I feel that we’ve hit a snag with Project-Saga.</p><p>They said they wanted a participant from the first year, the second year, and the third year each.</p><p>But it isn’t a <em>requirement</em>, so at this point, maybe I should just ask my fellow second years… either Yuuki, or Isara.</p><p>It doesn’t feel right though, sticking with familiar faces all the time.</p><p>…mnn? What’s wrong, Transfer student? Do you have a question?</p><p>You seem to be a quiet person in nature, but I’d appreciate a few hums in response while we’re talking. It feels weird, like I’m talking to myself.</p><p>Anyway, so what is it? Tell me anything; I’m completely at loss with Project-Saga so… I’ll even grasp at straws now.</p><p>Huh? So you’re wondering why I didn’t bring up Akehoshi even though I mentioned Yuuki and Isara?</p><p>Even though I seem the closest with Akehoshi?</p><p>Really? We’re never on the same page, and all we ever do is argue.</p><p>…That conversely makes it look like we get along really well? Does it? I guess it’s not something I can tell on my own.</p><p>I think relatively highly of him as an idol… but I can’t respect him at all as a fellow human. We’re like oil and water.</p><p>…Mm? Aah, so I haven’t answered your question.</p><p>Before that, do you, umm… I don’t know how to phrase this—</p><p>Would you happen to know of any idol named Akehoshi besides our comrade, Akehoshi of Trickstar?</p><p>Mmu. I got you puzzled, huh. Sorry for phrasing it in such a weird way.</p><p>It’s a topic I prefer not to touch. Not just me… anyone would probably feel the same.</p><p>Hmm. So it seems you don’t know about ‘that Akehoshi’.</p><p>You’re faring very well as a producer, so I tend to forget but…</p><p>Come to think of it, you were a complete amateur who didn’t know the first thing about idols.</p><p>So of course you wouldn’t know about ‘that Akehoshi’. He was from a different generation and that was pretty long ago, so he might’ve faded into history.</p><p>Plus, the entertainment industry had scrambled to erase it all like ‘it never happened’.</p><p>Nn? No, it’s fine if you don’t know. The explanation shouldn’t come from me; if you’re really curious, you can directly ask Akehoshi.</p><p>Though I don’t think he wants to talk about it either.</p><p>Anyway, so Project-Saga is about reviving past idols…</p><p>…and explaining the history of idols and showbiz extensively, right?</p><p>The project’s all about raking over the ashes. I hesitate to get Akehoshi involved in that.</p><p>As you know, Akehoshi’s a big ball of perkiness and innocence, a guy like a main character who probably won’t lose out to anyone…</p><p>But he’s also carrying something hazardous inside; a bomb that may burst with just a single touch.</p><p>And the way he is now, I don’t know if he’s strong enough to hang on when it explodes. His surroundings will take damage too, and I’m sure Akehoshi doesn’t want that.</p><p>We won DDD and brought a revolution upon Yumenosaki Academy… You can say it’s been smooth sailing, yet it’s still a very thin ice we’re walking on.</p><p>It’s better to keep that in mind and be very cautious with the action we take. …or am I being a coward?</p><p>Fufu. Anyway, Project-Saga is, to the end, a detour for us. I prefer to get things done fast, instead of dragging it out.</p><p>First, we need to get our current hurdle over with, which is gathering comrades.</p><p>Yes. That’s why I called Morisawa-senpai over, as he is the likeliest to become our third-year participant.</p><p>We arranged a meeting here, so I plan to have a face-to-face with him now.</p><p>…though it appears Senpai is slightly tardy.</p><p>I wonder if something happened? He doesn’t seem like the sort of person to break promises or rules without reason.</p><p>I barely ever spoke with him so I only have a vague idea, but he’s probably a serious honor student-type, right?</p><p>I think he didn’t cause any trouble last year…</p><p>No, he didn’t seem very involved in the disputes either, so I don’t have much to go on.</p><p>Hmm, Akehoshi often speaks badly of Morisawa-senpai. But Akehoshi and I don’t hit off well, so perhaps I’ll turn out to get along with him.”</p><h3 id="roundabout-15">Roundabout / 15</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Nn? What’s wrong, Transfer Student?

I cursed the people I admired.</p><p>For being liars… Dreams will come true if you believe? Love will save the world? A hero will come running if you cry for help?</p><p>They were lies, all of it. But that’s why I don’t want those kids to have to experience the feelings I did.</p><p>If there are no heroes in this world, I will become its first hero.</p><p>I will make the dream I believed in come true, save the world with love, and run to the people who cry and embrace them!</p><p>If I become such a hero, the heroes on TV won’t be liars anymore!</p><p>That would mean the heroes I admired and loved truly exist!</p><p>I can believe that they were right all along!

D-Did you forget something?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “No, but the downcast look on your face bothered me!</p><p>I thought that my words and attitude might’ve hurt you…!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Umm. That’s needless worry, Morisawa-senpai; you didn’t do anything wrong. I’m just down over my own incompetence.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I see! That’s good!</p><p>Wait, no it isn’t! I want children to always smile! If you’re feeling down, that falls under our responsibility as your seniors!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t treat me like a child. We’re not so far apart in age, are we?</p><p>Anyway, just go back to your lesson, Morisawa-senpai.</p><p>This is an important time for Ryuuseitai, right? You don’t have time to mess around here.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yes. And it’s probably the same for everyone, because it’s the start of a new school year… a new era.</p><p>It’s time for all of us to be strengthening our foothold, paying utmost caution to our path so we don’t stumble as we walk forward.</p><p>Yet!</p><p>You’re moving for the sake of somebody else, when your days should be far more hectic than mine, having stood at the maelstrom of the revolution!</p><p>You’re shaving time off your precious days of youth and giving the best you have! That’s admirable! Not everyone can do that – I’m so touched!</p><p>No. When everyone gave up, thinking nothing could be done and acquiescing to the huge current…</p><p>Only you guys defied it and arose, acting on the thought that things couldn’t stay that way.</p><p>And you caused it, a revolution! Because that’s what you guys are like!</p><p>Perhaps you were thoughtless children selfishly kicking up a fuss, but none of us could do the same thing you did!</p><p>I respect you! What you pulled off has value!</p><p>So don’t cast your gaze downward, Hidaka! There is absolutely no reason for you to be feeling down!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Morisawa-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Alright, that decides it! Let me take back my previous words!</p><p>I’ll join Project-Saga, Hidaka! I’m happy to help! Just say the word and I’ll do my best to answer!</p><p>No actually, let me into your team! Please!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Eh? Huh – is that okay?</p><p>I’m grateful if you’ll join, Morisawa-senpai, but… your reasoning <em>did</em> satisfy me, you know?</p><p>You are right that you should prioritize Ryuuseitai, your own unit.</p><p>That’s the natural thing to do, and I’m the fool here. For pointlessly circling on a roundabout…</p><p>Project-Saga is a low-budget project; it’ll be a lot of work for little pay. Getting involved is just taking extra burdens.</p><p>Anyone will come to that conclusion if they stop to think for a bit.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah. But we’re children; we shouldn’t rack our brains over profits and losses so much.</p><p>A young idler is an old beggar, they say; I’m sure it’s better to do whatever we like on impulse, every once in a while.</p><p><em>We</em> couldn’t do that for a long time…We got swept into the easier way, and as a result, we couldn’t stop Yumenosaki Academy from rotting.</p><p>We thought we were living smartly and quietly, when we were just being worked conveniently by those with ill intent.</p><p>But the era has changed. <em>You guys</em> changed it.</p><p>I’ll do whatever I want this time! And right now, my instinct is saying that I mustn’t walk out on you!</p><p>It’s shouting that I must fight alongside you and put a smile on your face!</p><p>That’s my show of thanks towards you for bringing a revolution upon this school…</p><p>And a necessary step in my life! Or so I believe! This isn’t circling pointlessly on a roundabout – not at all!</p><p>So make me one of you!</p><p>I’ll stick around by force even if you say no! A hero never turns their back on a child with such a gloomy look!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Well… I’m happy you feel that way, but are you <em>really</em> sure?</p><p>I’d feel sorry to cause trouble for Ryuuseitai – for another unit.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Too late to say that, you know? You guys don’t live on your own; you give birth to frictions just by going about like always. Someone will get hurt, and it will be part of the trouble you caused.</p><p>Not everyone consented to your revolution.</p><p>Some are saddened by the change, others probably resent you for triumphing over them.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “But, in order for there to be less people hurt and dejected!</p><p>In order to save as many as possible and put smiles on their faces! What we can do is never cease thinking, keep giving our best efforts!</p><p>That’s what I want to do! So please, make me your comrade! That way, at least I may be able to make <em>you</em> smile!</p><p>With this method, I’ll spread smiles one by one!</p><p>If it is the way of the world that when someone smiles, another has to cry, then I’ll take on all the tears in the world!</p><p>Don’t worry! You won’t be causing trouble for Ryuuseitai! Whatever it takes, I’ll make time to care for the kids!</p><p>And I’ll help you at the same time!</p><p>Maybe I’ll have to spend my days in constant fatigue for a bit, but that’s fine by me! I just need to hold on and give it all I’ve got, and there’ll be no problem!</p><p>Heroes will make any painstaking effort if it means everyone can smile!</p><p>Even if we heroes become so hurt and exhausted that we collapse, as long as the world is peaceful by then, it’s our win! Fuhahahaha☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Uh, huh… I <em>think</em> I get what you’re trying to say.</p><p>But are you sure? I feel sorry since it’s like I’m imposing the burdens on you, Morisawa-senpai—”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Oh what, don’t worry about it! Relax! I wished for this way of life!</p><p>In fact, I have to thank you! Thanks to you, I managed to take a step closer to my idea of a hero!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Fufu. You’re such a strange person – exactly as Akehoshi said.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fuhaha! Of course! The kid loves me, after all☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I don’t think we’re having the same conversation, but oh well… I’m very happy that you consented to become one of us. It makes everything worthwhile.</p><p>It may end up being hard on you, but still… we’ll be in your care, Morisawa-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Sure! Same here!

Did you have a job as Ryuuseitai from the morning?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yes! I was standing on the side of the school road to do morning greetings!</p><p>Also, I wear this outfit for no reason sometimes because I’m just so happy to be Red!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Huh.

Does Yumenosaki just have so few staff?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. I’m sure it’s because they think you can be counted on, Sagami-sensei. That’s why they keep giving work to you. No rest for heroes! ♪”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nah, I’m no ally of justice so I wanna have my rest.</p><p>…I could’ve refused if I really wasn’t up to it though; I guess I still can’t leave the habit of making rash promises.</p><p>But refusing people is also such a mental drain.</p><p>Sometimes, it’s just easier to accept and make ends meet somehow by exerting yourself.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fuhaha♪ As I would expect from you, Sagami-sensei! So kind! Unable to reject people who seek help – you truly have the qualities of a hero!</p><p>That’s why you are the Legendary Hero… Ryuusei Rainbow☆”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “You’re about the only one who still remembers that name. And honestly, if you want it so much, I’m more than happy to have that silly title off my hands.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “No, no! I like being Red!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “That so.

Since I get injured a lot!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “You bet you do… Are you okay? You’re not being bullied, are you?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “No, it’s because I’ve been taking more stunt work these days. It’s my way of laying the groundwork, since I want to network with industry people.</p><p>And I thought I might be able to get more jobs for Ryuuseitai if I got along better with people in the field.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Hmm. Stunts, huh. As an idol, you’re the one who should be substituted by a stuntman, y’know?</p><p>You might’ve got off with light injuries so far, but no one knows what can happen. Be extra careful, you hear me?</p><p>It’s harder on some people to have to resign due to accidents, injuries or illnesses, instead of being dismissed for failures.</p><p>Kunugi-sensei’s an example. He complains about it in the pub all the time.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Oh, is that so? I’m not very familiar with Kunugi-sensei, so I had no idea!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Thought so. Children, please have more interest in Akiyan.</p><p>The masses are cruel, huh. They won’t even bat an eyelash, whatever happens to people who didn’t take first place…</p><p>Especially people from other industries, I think they’re not even aware of the incidental details.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I understand!

How many are there anyway? Aren’t there too many Kamen R*ders out there…? I feel bad for the villains.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu.

I just noticed, but you’ve got a really huge scrape there.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yes. Actually, I came to get this treated.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Say that sooner.

Then I’m very happy to have put that smile on his face.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Really. But if your exhaustion gets to you so much that you get into an accident and wind up with a serious injury… he’ll blame himself for the rest of his life.</p><p>Take good care of that body, Morisawa.</p><p>I’m telling you this as a doctor, a teacher, and an individual.

Head to your class, Morisawa. Take care.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Okay… Before that, may I ask a question?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn? Sure, what’s up? If it’s not too important, can it wait until after school?</p><p>Mornings are always so busy, I can’t keep dealing with just you.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Well, it’s about Project-Saga. Is it really an insignificant, low-budget project?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. Just a plan some old man I know made on a whim.</p><p>It’ll be serialized in a small corner of a magazine; a trivial story that doesn’t matter either way… or so I think. What’s bothering you?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right, so while I was doing stunt work, I overheard industry people bringing up the name ‘Project-Saga’ a lot.</p><p>It has a direct connection with me too now I’ve been officially welcomed into the team, so I leaned closer.</p><p>Apparently, they were talking about how a production agency somewhere is really interested in Project-Saga and may invest a lot of money in it.</p><p>Like, on the level of affecting stock prices and stuff. They were all treating the gossip very earnestly.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “An agency? I haven’t heard anything like that…</p><p>The writer that the magazine company sent for Project-Saga didn’t say anything of the sort either.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ah, they sent someone like that?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yeah. I mean, the project is led by a magazine company, so we can’t just carry out things as we like.</p><p>There’s this kid from the company who’s gonna visit us periodically to check how we’re doing and write a report.</p><p>And then they’ll spruce up the report into an interesting article for the magazine. That’s all Project-Saga is.</p><p>A huge investment, huh… That’s more trouble than help.</p><p>We don’t even have anything to spend it on, no plans for huge spectacular live shows… I think that’s just baseless gossip.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Well… the people talking about it didn’t seem very certain, and it doesn’t sound realistic…</p><p>But when I brought this up in a conversation, the topic seemed to pique my classmate’s, Tenshouin’s, interest.</p><p><em>I knew they were making a move; time to come up with something on my end</em>…</p><p>…or so he said. I don’t know what he meant, though.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Huh. So Tenshouin said that… He’s been quiet these days, and I thought it’s because he was either sated or tired by DDD – but he’s started scheming again?</p><p>I’m feeling a little uneasy.

What’s wrong, children? Not feeling well? Should we go to the infirmary?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, there’s no need. We’re fine. It’s just different from what I know, since Trickstar’s meetings don’t go like this.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ooh, so you guys <em>do</em> hold proper meetings. Just based on impressions, I thought you always go into things blind.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, that’s not wrong. But in our case, we usually just gather around and chat and it somehow ends up being a meeting down the line.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. It’s great how well you guys get along, but… that won’t work outside of your circle, so you should get used to the normal way.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, I thought the same. …again, I’m happy to have you in the team, Morisawa-senpai.</p><p>I’m still very much inexperienced, so I ask for your guidance and support.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Why, thanks for the warm welcome. But I’m busy with Ryuuseitai too, so I may end up participating for some days but not others.</p><p>I’ll drop a note when I can’t come, so for those times, I hope you’ll share what went on in the meeting or the lesson afterward.</p><p>I want to match my pace with the team, after all.</p><p>Mmu? What’s wrong, Transfer Student? You’re raising your hand… what are you trying to assert?</p><p>Oh, so you’ll be in charge of correspondence. That’ll be a huge help.</p><p>Aside from that, we should also create a chatroom for Project-Saga in the school SNS.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah, I leave those things to you kids. They’re too difficult for an old man like me, so teach me the ropes later.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yessir! Leave it to me, Sagami-sensei! ♪”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Full of spirit you are… I’m mostly belittled by my students, so your attitude is actually refreshing and a little awkward for me.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmph. First of all, there’s something wrong with students belittling you. Be someone of respect, as a teacher should be.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Sure, sure… Anyway, we’re hectic from the get-go, but can I start the meeting already? Since everyone’s gathered.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah, I was wondering about that. If following the original plan, there should be a first year participant for Project-Saga, right?</p><p>I’ve had difficulties scouting, but don’t we still need to search for a first year to invite?</p><p>I was thrown off, hearing we were going to hold a meeting without a full team.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ah actually, we’re all good now. I got us a first year to be part of the team.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ooh… You’re so dependable, Morisawa-senpai. I’m glad to have you on our side.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hehe. But don’t praise me too much; I didn’t have a hand in this.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What do you mean? Since you said you got us a first year, I thought it might be someone from Ryuuseitai… am I wrong?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “It’s not one of my kids. As I said before, I want the Ryuuseitai kids to prioritize getting used to their new life and idol work.</p><p>I don’t want to risk getting them involved in Project-Saga, since it’s not part of our original course.</p><p>They’re gonna end up with half-hearted results in both and fall between two stools.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm, I don’t understand. Who did you choose to be our comrade, then?</p><p><em>No</em> first year is used to their new life, that’s why they’re difficult to scout—”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right. I already spoke to Tenshouin, so ‘the kid’ should head to this classroom as soon as his own classes are over…</p><p>But he’s not showing up. Did he get into trouble?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Te-Tenshouin? The student president? To be honest, I don’t want to get too involved with him…”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Don’t be so wary. Tenshouin’s a human like you and me. It’s not like crafting schemes is meat and drink to him or anything, I don’t think.</p><p>Tenshouin seems to be suspicious of a hidden agenda behind Project-Saga.</p><p>He really wants a bite into the whole deal, so he sent us a kid from his place to gather intel for him.</p><p>A spy, in other words. But well, we’ve been looking for a first year too, so don’t our interests align?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What the – that’s so fishy… So the student council president sent us his protege, is that it? Who?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Wait. I’ll try calling him, Tenshouin told me his number anyway.</p><p>Uhh, should be in H…i… It’s hard to look for names if I don’t sort my list every once in a while.</p><p>Ah, there it is.

It seems Himemiya is in a better mood now that he’s eating the sweets the transfer student prepared for the meeting…</p><p>Let’s pick up where we left off, then.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…I’m not in a better mood. Ah geez, this is the worst thing ever.</p><p>You’re wrong if you think you can sweeten me up with this one piece of candy! Offer up something that matches my nobility or you’re not really trying!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “So the candy isn’t <em>sweet</em> enough to <em>sweeten</em> you up.

I haven’t forgiven you, I’ll have you know!”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “There, there… Don’t be so crabby, and just stick with us for the time being, okay Himemiya? Look, here’s a cookie♪”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “I-I said you won’t convince me with sweets! Don’t treat me like a kid!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t say that. Look, we have konpeito too.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…? What is that? I’ve never seen it before. Don’t try to feed me something weird like… con-pei-toh? Which country is it from?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Fufu♪”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “W-Why did you laugh!? It feels like I’m being made a fool of! Gee~eez! I can’t stand this!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay okay, let’s end the games here. You guys came here in the middle of your busyness, so let’s be efficient and make the best use of the time we have.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right. Himemiya, I know you don’t like this, but sit tight and listen like a good boy. Tenshouin sent you here with something in mind, right?</p><p>So if you don’t carry out the role like he wished, you’re gonna be betraying his expectations of you. …or is it unfair of me to say that?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…Mmu. But I am absolutely not happy to do this, okay!? I don’t know what this Project-Saga is, but it’s so like circling on a roundabout!</p><p>Ahh geez! I just wanna get this over with and go back to <em>fine</em>’s lessons!”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yeah. And for that, we need to discuss our plans forward. Here, have more of these sweets♪”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Hey, why do you keep trying to feed me? Morisawa-senpai, right? You’re stepping out of line! Back off!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (Hmm, but that’s Morisawa-senpai for you. He’s skillfully leading Himemiya on. So that’s how you deal with his type… There’s a lot to learn from this.</p><p>Is it something like how I give Akehoshi ten yen coins to make him listen?</p><p>No… that only works because Akehoshi picks up on the cues and plays along. It’s something like our own little ritual.</p><p>It won’t work with just anybody.</p><p>I need to study up more on the sure-fire methods that work outside of Trickstar, or I won’t be able to survive in this harsh industry.</p><p>Project-Saga should be a good chance. Let’s see what lesson it can offer me on the know-how of idols.)</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “…Yeah, I see each of you have your own thinking. But since you’ve decided to partake, I’ll need you to work hard to some extent.</p><p>I pray that Project-Saga won’t really end up being a roundabout detour for you kids.</p><p>Once again, thank you very much for choosing to help out with this project.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmph. You’re being unusually upstanding, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Got to be, sometimes. Lowering my head is part of my job as an adult, and you guys gotta cultivate the habit of acting polite where it’s due, too.</p><p>Anyway, since this is our first meeting for the project… we’ll have introductions and discuss our plan going forward.</p><p>And there’s one more thing to decide first of all.</p><p>But wait, are you guys really fine with me at the helm? If anyone wanna be the coordinator, I don’t mind stepping down?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, you do it, Sensei. You’re the originator, so lead properly at least this once.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Right. And a teacher is of course superior to students. Having one at the top and leading is the safest bet – or just the most natural way of things.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Mmu. Well, I’m still the most superior around here.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “On what basis? You put up a sweeter front back when you just enrolled; is this your true face?</p><p>Ah well. Then I’ll be leading. First things first, you guys have the basics of Project-Saga down pat, of course?</p><p>What about you, Himemiya? If you don’t know anything, I can give a loose summary.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “I’m okay… sir. I studied the proposal firsthand and asked the president and Yuzuru for things I didn’t know.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “The two of us were involved since the start of the project, so of course we grasp the overall idea.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I also don’t have any problem so far, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah, honor students. I could just sit back if every student were half as dutiful as you guys.</p><p>Anyway, you seem familiar enough with Project-Saga’s general idea, so I’ll be omitting some explanations.</p><p>First, I’ll go through our plans for the future, so if you have any questions, just pick a good time to speak, and say it.</p><p>Project-Saga is a whimsical project to be serialized in a weekly magazine by a staff member of said magazine company.</p><p>He isn’t here right now so I’ll have to leave his introduction for later, but I’ll be referring to him as our ‘Mr. Writer’ for convenience.</p><p>Mr. Writer will be visiting once a week to collect data for the week’s article or take photos for it.</p><p>Then he’ll write an article and finish it before the deadline, give it to us for the final check, and if there’s no problem, it’ll be put in the magazine.</p><p>The articles will be about the Legendary Idol… well, me.</p><p>About retired idols like me making a comeback and guiding the younger generation. He’ll be making a story out of it – a dramatization.</p><p>Like an inspirational teacher story? Or mentor-disciple story, was it?</p><p>Anyway, something like that will be held in several idol training schools and agencies all over the country, at the same time.</p><p>But for now, I’m the only Legendary Idol… the only retiree participating. So we’ll be the only ones featured.</p><p>If the negotiations go well, there will be more and more ‘mentor-disciples’ out there later.</p><p>And considering the number of pages, we’ll be less and less featured.</p><p>In other words, we won’t have to work too hard, eventually.</p><p>But since we’re the only ones right now, we need to come up with some sort of drama.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Even if you tell us to make drama… how does that happen, specifically?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ Hidaka, I heard you had a hard time gathering comrades. I think he’ll be making a dramatization out of that for starters.</p><p>Mr. Writer will probably visit you to ask some stuff later, so respond to him properly then.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. All right, I understand.”</p><h3 id="revival-5">Revival / 5</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “By the way, what kind of person is this writer?</p><p>We’ll probably be in for a long ride, so I’d like to know his basic profile from the outset.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Uh, he’s a young kid from a magazine company? Sorry, this little old man can’t tell apart kids of that age anymore.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Then how did you become a teacher, Sagami-sensei? Doesn’t your job demand an eye for people?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ When I was active, I could remember the face and name of each of my fans.</p><p>I think my head exploded from that and it shaved some cells off my brain. That’s why I’m so bad at remembering things now.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Hmph, I can’t believe you’ve gone senile at this age… sir.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “No need to force yourself to speak politely. We’re kinda a makeshift, ragtag group here, but we’re still a team that’s gotta support one another.</p><p>Let’s speak frankly; that’s easier on me.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That helps me too, but is it really okay to be so… not serious?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “It’s fine, 's fine. This is a silly low-budget project, we’re just gonna tire ourselves out being stiff.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Mmu. Why do <em>I</em> have to get involved in such a cheap event…?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm. So this writer only visits once a week?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yup. Well, it’s always been common knowledge that magazines don’t sell; and they seem to have their human resources cut due to the publishing slump.</p><p>The magazine companies don’t have enough people to write their articles.</p><p>Mr. Writer seems to have it tough, writing a bunch of other articles despite being presumably a newbie.</p><p>So he can’t pour all his attention on just us or Project-Saga.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Hmph. Cheap plan, meager staff; this project can’t look any more low-budget.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Isn’t that nice though? Gives us a chance to work our way from square one. I think this kind of hard work is important too, Himemiya.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Smartypants… Anyway Morisawa, I still don’t get your previous question.</p><p>What’s wrong with Mr. Writer only coming once a week?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “No, it just sounds hard, writing an article based only on the data he got on that day.</p><p>If possible, how about we make our own activity report to be handed over when he comes?</p><p>I have only layman knowledge on magazines and articles so I’m not too sure, but wouldn’t the writing process be smoother with more materials?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Aah, right. Maybe we’re meddling too much, but when you put yourself in the shoes of the guy who has to write…</p><p>Having access to that kind of report sounds super handy.</p><p>Transfer Student, can you put together something like that – even just whenever you have time?</p><p>The rest of us need to actively work to have anything written at all, so it’ll help if we can leave this to you.</p><p>Well, we can’t decide this on our own, so we gotta confirm this with Mr. Writer first, of course.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Oh, the transfer student seems thrilled. Do you like writing this kind of thing?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. Come to think of it, you always scribble in your notepad for every little thing, Transfer Student.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Nn~ Well, that sounds like a job for servants. …Write me in a cute, positive light, okay?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahaha. We need to do proper work first before any reports or articles get written, though.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm. It’s a weekly magazine, so we’ll be serialized weekly too… and that means we need to do at least one thing every week, huh?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Yup.</p><p>Well, we can also do one big thing that gets split up into several articles to save us a few weeks’ worth of work.</p><p>That, and your respective unit schedules, will be set for later discussion.</p><p>Let’s try to gather once a week… or at least somewhat regularly, if that’s hard.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Geh~ So this isn’t just a one-time thing? I’m sick of it already.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Don’t say that. I think it’s pretty fun, like gathering in a secret hideout.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, just enjoy the ride.</p><p>The content of our work is free for us to decide, as in the company didn’t make any particular demand, so… whaddya guys want?</p><p>I personally want us to do something relatively idol-like.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s incredibly vague. What’s idol-like? Live shows?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Lives are difficult, budget-wise… but a pseudo-live is possible.</p><p>All we need is to borrow the auditorium when no one’s using it and sing and dance there, after all.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Nn, but if we’re holding a live show, I wanna do it big and call lots of people in.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ohh, that’s great, Himemiya! Keep at it and assert your opinions more!”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “You’re such a pain! Stop getting in my hair!”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. Anyway, having a teacher for a member makes us an unusual case, but…</p><p>How about we register ourselves as a temporary unit?</p><p>Then we can submit proposals and receive funding from the student council when they’re accepted.</p><p>We can hold small live shows, so I think it’ll widen the variation of what we can do.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn~ I think budget should go to students, but that’s not a bad idea.</p><p>Honestly the funding from the magazine company is worth so little I don’t think it’ll take us anywhere.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Umm? Wait a second, what’s a ‘temporary unit’? We can only be part of one unit at a time, right?</p><p>Y-You’re telling me to resign from <em>fine</em>? I’m <em>never</em> doing that, you hear me!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Aah… that’s a term I miss. You don’t hear it a lot these days, but ‘temporary unit’ is a system that exists, huh.</p><p>It’s a unit formed temporarily for jobs that last for a limited period, right?</p><p>So we can be part of one without having to resign from our current units.</p><p>We still need to register for formation and get officially approved by the school, though.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Mm-hmm. Might be a good idea to give it a careful consideration. Heck, it’s convenient for moving along with Project-Saga.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…because…?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well. I said we have one thing to decide first of all, didn’t I?</p><p>Actually, the company asked us to decide on a name, a word to depict our team.</p><p>Which translates to ‘come up with a unit name!’, obviously.</p><p>‘Sagami Jin and His Disciples’ is unappealing on top of a mouthful, so apparently, it’s not ideal for writing articles.</p><p>So let’s take the chance to come up with an official name and make ourselves a temporary unit; write up a formation document, submit it, and get us that budget.</p><p>I bet that’s going to make future activities a whole lot easier.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fufu. And it’s kind of idol-like. Stories about idols typically start with the characters coming up with a name, after all.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Do they? So you watch dramas other than tokusatsu, Morisawa?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha. TV dramas and books, actually… Consuming novels and comics – old or new, western or eastern – have been my hobby for a long time.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s a surprise; I guess you can’t judge a book by its cover… I also often read books on the the train to school, so maybe we’ll have a lot to talk about, Morisawa-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Oh, really? What genres do you like, Hidaka?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “…I think we’ve strayed from the topic. Weren’t we thinking of a unit name?</p><p>I wanna get this over with so I can return to <em>fine</em>’s lesson, so focus!”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha, we got scolded. But Himemiya is right; let’s come up with a unit name first.</p><p>Anyone have a good idea?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… this is hard. I’m not very good with creative work.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Umm. I had almost nothing to do with idols until I enrolled here, so I don’t know much. How do people usually decide on unit names?</p><p>Do they all discuss it like this?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I wonder?</p><p>Ryuuseitai already existed since long before I enrolled, so I didn’t name it… I’m not too sure.</p><p>Hidaka, how did you guys decide on ‘Trickstar’?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Huh? I can’t remember.</p><p>We just had the name somehow. Who came up with it again…?</p><p>I think we were gathering like always, our talk heated up like always… and we just went ‘Let’s make it Trickstar!’ along the way?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha. That sounds like you guys alright.”</p><h3 id="revival-6">Revival / 6</h3><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm. You’re a freshman, Himemiya; I guess you don’t know where <em>fine</em> got its name?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Eh? I-I dunno… I think the members talked about the origin of the name <em>fine</em> in an article somewhere.</p><p>Something like ‘putting an end to the old era to create a new world’?</p><p>Fufu. When I first saw the name, I thought it was read fine as in <em>fain</em>.</p><p>I thought it sounded encouraging, optimistic and nice… For a while, I didn’t pick up that it was a musical term.</p><p>I practiced violin, so I <em>did</em> know the term.</p><p>But once you’re convinced something is read in a certain way, it sticks, and can be hard to fix.</p><p>Actually, I catch myself almost introducing myself as <em>fain</em> sometimes… Keep this a secret from President and the others, okay?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. …So you practiced the violin, Himemiya? My parents made me do it too.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Really? Wait Hidaka-senpai, are you actually from a well-off family? I’ve never seen you at social parties, though…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah, my parents probably go sometimes.</p><p>But we’re outsiders who moved in, so my parents probably hesitate to show up at events held by the prestigious families…”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Nn~ The people around here get pretty cliquish, yeah. My family is a newcomer too, so it can be uncomfortable.</p><p>They’re all old houses who insist they’ve owned the place since mythical times or something.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ooh, what a high-class conversation… And Sagami-sensei is the son of a big hospital too, so I’m the only one from a lower class. The difference in status hurts.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahaha. Aren’t people about how they live their life, not how they’re born? No idea though.</p><p>Anyway, we’re supposed to be thinking of a unit name. You guys really don’t have a good idea?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Nn~ Shouldn’t we come up with a name that suits our goal, like <em>fine</em>?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right. We have nothing in common after all; we can’t come up with a name based on the image of the members, the way Ra*bits did.</p><p>It’s hard to come up with a word that can describe our untidy group.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm, if we’re thinking backward from our goal…</p><p>We were gathered for Project-Saga, so… what? ‘Master-disciple’ but in English?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Nn~ It doesn’t strike a chord with me. The center of the project is Sagami… -sensei, so maybe we should start with him?</p><p>Sagami-sensei, what was your unit when you were active?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Nn? Nah, idol units weren’t a thing at all during my time.</p><p>Prolly hard to believe for you guys, who are completely saturated by the unit system, though.</p><p>I worked solo. Under the name ‘Sagami Jin’, so my real name.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Oh, so things used to be like that…?</p><p>I thought we can play around with Sagami-sensei’s unit name if he used to be part of a unit…</p><p>…since Project-Saga is all about reviving old idols for nostalgia effect, right?</p><p>So I thought it would be fitting to attach the name of the legendary idol; like, the fans might love it.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. Then why not pull it from Sagami-sensei’s name instead, or a title he had?</p><p>…Fufu. This kind of thinking game is fun, like a puzzle.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Eh~? But I don’t wanna arrange my name to sound cool and end up looking like a narcissist…</p><p>Isn’t it embarrassing? Like those usernames chuuni kids come up with.</p><p>Well, the name Project-Saga isn’t much different, though.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hmm. On the topic of Sagami-sensei’s title – that would be ‘Super Idol’, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right… We can make it plural into ‘Super Idols’ maybe?</p><p>But save for Sagami-sensei, we’re not exactly super idols yet, so we won’t be living up to the name…”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Eh~? That sounds so lame. Make it more like, fashionable and fancy!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahaha. I think idol stage names sound better cheap and over-the-top, though… or is this sentiment ancient?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ah, I got it! You were the Legendary Hero ‘Ryuusei Rainbow’, Sagami-sensei—</p><p>So how about we call ourselves ‘Rainbows’!?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Sounds lame!? What are we, a baseball team!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…I like it though. I mean, it’s the rainbow; doesn’t it sound pretty?”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “Eehh, what’s wrong with these people’s naming sense…? These are the guys I have to work with?</p><p>I don’t wanna keep worrying over the name though, so I don’t mind going ahead with that if you guys are sure.</p><p>Just don’t write it in katakana, 'kay? I think it will look <em>somewhat</em> better in alphabet, at least.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “…hmm? The transfer student is holding up a notebook – I think she wants us to see.</p><p>Ooh… I was wondering what you’ve been fervently scribbling there… so you immediately put together a report, huh?</p><p>But since you’re a producer, you should join the discussion more instead of doing secretary work.</p><p>Mm-hmm. So you wrote down the unit name in alphabet as a test?</p><p>And even designed mockups for the logo already…?</p><p>That may be too soon. But a help anyway; we need to get a feel of how it looks.</p><p>…Mnn? ‘Rain-bows’? Where did the hyphen come from?</p><p>Ah, so it’s just a half-erased trace. But I think it’s nice; cutting it in the middle like that makes it seem meaningful.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Meaningful without an actual meaning. But that may be like us, in a way.</p><p>As if alluding to how we encountered each other by coincidence on the roundabout path we took.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Then we’re officially Rain-bows, is that okay?</p><p>If that’s decided, I’ll report it to our writer. And I’ll also do something about the formation proposal for our temporary unit on my end.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I have no problem with it, Sagami-sensei! However, I think we mustn’t trouble you with the proposal, so please let me do it!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, the transfer student says she wants to try her hand at it. She seems interested in writing a formation proposal, since she’s never made one before.</p><p>I think it’ll be good experience for her too, so please give her the chance.</p><p>Fufu. Rain-bows… will probably be the first unit you’ve truly made, won’t it?</p><p>And I’m honored to be part of it – even if I feel bad for Akehoshi and the others.”</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> “I’m not too happy with the lame name, but…</p><p>Ah well, who cares. Can we end it here if there’s nothing left to discuss?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Sure. We decided what had to be decided, I said what had to be said.</p><p>Let’s gather again in a week or so. That’s all for today.</p><p>This should be enough circling on a roundabout; go back and move on with your original course. Thanks for today, everyone.</p><p>And I’m counting on you from now on, Rain-bows. Haha, to think I’ll have my first unit experience at this age, eh?”</p>]]></content>

But if Sora-kun says so, it must be true.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Umm, you shouldn’t be chilling out, Aoba-senpai… Sorry, but can I ask you to fill these documents?</p><p>Since Anzu got the proposal approved, the Star Spirit Festival became an official DreamFest. There’s a bunch of miscellaneous things to take care of before we can participate.</p><p>By the way, official DreamFests need student council members to supervise them, but this time I’ll be both a participant <em>and</em> the stuco supervisor, so…</p><p>Frankly speaking, we can go pretty free with the program.</p><p>There’s not much time until the Star Spirit Festival, so let’s get the program and other planning done with so we can move onto the other hurdles… Wait, huh? Where’s our key person, Sakasaki?&quot;</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> &quot;Natsume-kun is still at work.</p><p>Nn~ Please give me the forms. There’s limit to what we can do without a leader, but I’ll start by filling what we can answer on our own.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Ah, right. The leader of Switch isn’t the third-year Aoba-senpai.</p><p>Even looking at the units in whole, it’s rare for an underclassman to be the one at the top and leading.&quot;</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> &quot;Isn’t it~? But I do think that seniority shouldn’t matter when it comes to leadership, and the one with the right attributes should take the role.</p><p>And I’m not the type who can bring a group together and pull them forward, either.&quot;</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…In the old <em>fine</em>, you seemed like their representative, Aoba-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> &quot;Ah~ I was in charge of middle management, more like. Acting as a pipe to connect top and bottom with left and right? That’s what a leader amounts to, in the end.</p><p>But with Yumenosaki’s unit system, the leaders are granted quite huge rights, and burdened with as heavy responsibilities to even it out.</p><p>So it <em>does</em> sort of make them feel more like kings governing their own small nations.</p><p>But it’s probably better to think of leaders as more like coordinators, in charge of smoothing out the human relations.&quot;</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…I see. I learned a lot; so there’s that way of seeing things.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Yuuki-sensee<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>, play against Sora! Pretty please~♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No, we came to have lessons, so let’s leave the gaming for later… But I’ve been meaning to ask, why do you attach ‘sensei’ to my name, Harukawa-kun?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> &quot;&lt;HiHi~♪&gt; Because Yuuki-sensee is the high score expert! In the memory cards left behind in the Game Club, there are quite a few records Sora still can’t reach~</p><p>Sora really respects you!&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Thank you~ I’m often told that scores aren’t everything there is to games,</p><p>But when games give you scores, of course you’d want to aim for the highest, right? It’s really easy to understand too.&quot;</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> &quot;Fufu. That’s why Eichi-kun and the rest created the DreamFest system. They set it up so victory and defeat would be easy to understand, by assigning scores.</p><p>Without that being made clear, the conditions of victory would become vague…</p><p>…which gives people little reason to try harder. So showing hard scores is effective in preventing that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I don’t like them too much though; numbers.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> &quot;Because numbers can seem heartless and cold, I suppose. But that’s why numbers have their benefits. It may still be hard to understand for you guys.</p><p>Eichi-kun discovered numbers – currency – and introduced them. And we still use them even now, living in the society he built.</p><p>That’s an amazing thing. Everyone needs to be more grateful to Eichi-kun.&quot;</p><h2 id="naming-a-star-6">Naming a Star / 6</h2><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Of course, I totally respect Eichi-senpai.</p><p>But anyway, Blue-senpai, so I guess you’re… pretty close friends with him, after all?

But just because of that, I won’t speak badly of him like we’re strangers or even less.</p><p>Akehoshi-kun, I’m sure that even if in the distant future you and the rest of Trickstar go on separate ways… you won’t want people to speak badly of the dream you’re currently chasing together, either?</p><p>Even if we’re no longer friends, even if the parting had been sorrowful… that dream we saw together in that distant past continues to shine like a star to the present.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nn~ I don’t really wanna think about us going on separate ways, though.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> &quot;Ahaha, you guys will probably be fine. Not that I have any basis for that.</p><p>Let’s leave that aside for now; we should change and start the lessons instead of chatting idly. Oh, suddenly I’m talking like I’m in charge… I’m sorry.</p><p>Officially, Trickstar as an SS qualifier should be above us in rank, so can you guys take charge?&quot;</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> &quot;No, even if Switch doesn’t leave much track record in the public eye, I believe we’re on equal footing in terms of skills. As the most senior member, I’d appreciate if you’ll take lead, Aoba-senpai.</p><p>Switch is the main role this time around, while us Trickstar are the extra. Or more like, we’re only helping out because some aspects of this concern us.</p><p>As the class rep, I wish to help my classmate through hard times. And we’re secretly hoping to get a TV-related job through our connection with Sakasaki.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Yup, 'cuz we’ve got an overriding necessity to be raising our name right now!</p><p>Well, though we’re planning to savor the main role if we catch you unmotivated or unguarded! Ahaha☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> &quot;There you go, saying things you don’t even mean. You’re such good children, really… Well, frankly, we’re still in the middle of waiting for Natsume-kun’s reply.</p><p>We discussed it over during lunch break, and decided that Switch would participate in the Star Spirit Festival.</p><p>But we still don’t know if <em>Natsume-kun</em> is included in that.</p><p>I’m sure you’re aware, but that child is very busy right now.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Mmu~? Shisho <em>absolutely</em> has to join us!”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> &quot;You don’t get to decide that, Sora-kun.</p><p>But then again, if that’s your wish, Natsume-kun will probably grant it for you.

Wow, it’s so rare to see Kitagawa-san with a smile…♪”</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> &quot;Sorry, I guess that was rude. But, it was funny how your brows jerked as you gulped down the melon soda. I couldn’t hold my laugh, sorry.</p><p>Ca-Can you do it again? I want to see your brows turn up and down like before.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “Eh, eh!? I did that? How did I do it… Nn~ Nnggh~?”</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> “No, they’re not moving at all. Maybe I got the commands wrong; that’s interesting. Don’t be so nervous, relax… Here, drink some melon soda♪”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> &quot;I-If I drink that much soda, I’m going to burp. And I can’t drink up what’s yours, Kitagawa-san.</p><p>Umm, Kitagawa-san… T-Thanks.&quot;</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> “…Why are you thanking me?”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “Well, I was happy you came up to talk to me… Did you need something, Kitagawa-san?”</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> “No, I was just wondering what you were doing alone.

I’m ‘all alone’ too.”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “But Kitagawa-san, aren’t you on good terms with your… classmates?”</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> &quot;Well. At school, everyone is starting to talk to me a lot.</p><p>But the girls in 1-A are all good girls, it’s hard to invite them to play at the arcade. Plus, I’m the only one really good at games, so I don’t know if I can so casually ask people to play me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> &quot;Oh~ B-But you can ask me out anytime! I’m probably gonna get in your way since I’m bad at games, but you can invite me if you’re feeling lonely, okay?</p><p>I want to be friends with you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> “Th–Thanks. You’re hard to ask out too though, since you seem busy with your club.”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> &quot;That’s not entirely true~ I can’t play instruments, so I barely have anything to do at the club. Though in exchange for that, I work hard on composing the songs.</p><p>You’re good at games, aren’t you Kitagawa-san? I’m so jealous, that you have something you’re good at. I mean, I know I just have to work hard to learn a skill myself, but…&quot;</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> “Yup, leveling up your skills is important. …Can you come over here?”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> &quot;W-What is it? Wawa – don’t pull my hand~?</p><p>Kitagawa-san, your hand is so soft and squishy. You’re like a hardcore gamer, so I thought your hands would be hard from pushing buttons too much.&quot;</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> “Same with you – soft and squishy. I thought people who play music get a lot of calluses. Oh, but you said you don’t play?”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “I’m practicing it, I guess… Ehehe, I’m holding hands with Kitagawa-san. I’m so happy♪”</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> “Nn… Um, if you have some time, can you spend it with me?”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “What is it~? Are we playing games together?”</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> &quot;Yeah. Please, can you play with me? I don’t know if they changed their management or what, but there’s been an increase in machines for couples here.</p><p>They’re for normies and girls who don’t usually play games. So the difficulty level is so casual. I don’t like it.</p><p>But, I sort of made it my mission… to gain the highest score and place at the top of the ranking, in every machine in this arcade that records player scores.</p><p>I want to be the highest scorer even for the casual games. But I can’t play them on my own, since they’re for couples.</p><p>I mean, I <em>can</em> be a kill-joy and play two roles on my own, paying for two and all… but I want to go by the rules when I can. Will you help me?&quot;</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “S-Sure. If I can be of help to you, I will.”</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> “Thanks. Ah, all the machines here are the for-couples games. Which do you like? I guess Tsukinaga-san would prefer rhythm games?”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “Ah, I want that car one! You know, my big brother drives a car… and he always looks so cool doing it, so I wanna get a driving license when I grow up. This is for practice~♪”</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> “I think you can’t practice real life stuff with games… but racing game it is. OK. I asked you, so I’ll pay your share too. I’ll be inserting the coins then.”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “Ah! I want to pay my own share. I can’t enjoy the game from the heart if the money didn’t came out of my own pocket. Umm, I just need to sit here, right?”</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> “Yeah. …ah, so we’re sitting side-by-side. Well, it <em>is</em> for couples. It says one will be driving and the other will be assisting. Which do you want to do?”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “Can I drive? I wanna go at top speed~ I’ll try not to get us into accidents!”</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> “Mmn~… I’m pretty good at racing games, so it’s better that I’m the one driving if we’re aiming for a high score… but oh well. You can drive. I’ll assist with all I have.”</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “Okay. Ah! We can pick a car. I wonder which one’s good~ I want a cute one.”</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> &quot;Pick based on its specs, not looks. The ones tailored for beginners are usually not ideal for scoring.</p><p>But I guess it’s okay. That’s what techniques are for; to cover up what the specs lack.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ruka:</strong> “Ah, it can take our pictures, Kitagawa-san! Make a peace sign! Peace~♪”</p><p><strong>Yuki:</strong> &quot;Peace…♪</p><p>Ahaha. Maybe I should forget about scores and enjoy games for what they are once in a while…♪&quot;</p><h2 id="seira-suzu">Seira &amp; Suzu</h2><h3 id="seraphim-and-lucifer">Seraphim and Lucifer</h3><p><em>Title note</em>[^2]</p><p><strong>&gt; Empty Lot</strong> (Night)</p><p><strong>Seira:</strong> “~…♪”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Sera!”</p><p><img alt="suzuseira" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HWzxLUhEyWtJ3j5ohifNQZPqYu4rZplb0YKTSjGjpEpQGnwUPxPkvE1N-bONhuzynRNEGzjJx_n6_KAjSiW1K5ti7d56XPfXMJreO-T6yY9e_Ll-oldC2n-E37X-_5cnL5wLY-Wk0_U6Rr_O6jdHC2fHwpv5vzXYO-a0LiCEQhnp0O8q1FRJy0TMien8RxTIjj897m16UkUdv4GQn6NFEe2whm9fC9lKOwzOWrXgtUYnBJUbih3mu-kP-xZq0IF0kTTuHm0YKDLPr8lZZONP-7rf-6B_l__39yn_FnOHbGFeW6cw5KW6Z0Donnw9f0m5YeExlw1EConzFfw8bdHxkLpe-JqJYhIyh8HqQicB1D3T8Zl51BMi3Hw3YEB1eedvTr1gyiDSaIJKa-3ZltuuQbGH6PvtwL_SOJOLhUhX3009cKWTfrcXsddR4cHMoXm9g7xbOZdkno3nHcOA5HOYY0hDYwY8uPfvBObL7VA29OMYJla8lK1jQe9l0sgUW78pME6n7DDd3gZpXWMwqQEIzfEgQi8XyvLJk9-aSeG2MSbnp2paoMWXXX3pCU_om3i9bew8r_am-lVrb7e20hFvQygOIAaWG8YQBZqTlNfuKOWsUrDuJCNkTceq35plnk9BLvuQ2drkIfX0sxFuWgNbBJvQmVcL1LTfxPfxIA1bamD8JHi84Qa5rVS5A37Yv70dmroStw0ghOt-IgmVHg=w1051-h591-no"></p><p><strong>Seira:</strong> &quot;Mmn?

Didn’t you mention that on your last visit, Kuro-chan?</p><p>But I saw the music sheets, you know… and some parts looked pretty difficult, so I’ll teach you how it works! Kuro-chan, I thought you may be having trouble with it since you don’t specialize in singing~♪</p><p>So <em>I</em> will teach you! Cuz I’m the leader of the band! Hehe…♪</p><p>Let’s sing, sing with me! Hey, Kuro-chan…♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> &quot;Sera… Sorry, gimme time to catch my breath.</p><p>Huff, haah… Aah, I’m beat. I was looking all over for you. I searched all the places I thought you’d be; I didn’t think I’ll end up finding you at the empty lot right beside the hospital.</p><p>Don’t make us worry too much. I’m not your family or your lover, so I don’t have the right to demand anything from you. But I’ll still say this:</p><p>Treasure yourself more. Please, Sera.</p><p>You’re sitting down at this kind of place because you couldn’t move after escaping out of your room, right…? That’s a given. You’re in no condition to be up and about.</p><p>Let’s go back to the hospital. You need to rest on a bed.&quot;</p><p><strong>Seira:</strong> &quot;Mmn? Go back – to the <em>hospital</em>? You say such strange things; the Rock Band Club is my home! Because I’m the leader of the band! Ahaha! ☆</p><p>Oh, you’re such a worrywart, you know, Kuro-chan! I’m fine! Look, I can probably even fly right now…☆ Look at my wings flapping! Flap-flap~♪</p><p>Hau!? Oowww, I fell! I hit my head! Ahahaha! ☆</p><p>Ahahahaha! Is it because I’m also a broken-winged Lucifer that I can’t fly, since my wings are broken? I completely forgot! Ahahahahaha…☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Sera…?”</p><p><strong>Seira:</strong> &quot;Aha, haha… Oh Kuro-chan, why are you wearing that kind of face? We’re going to hold a live! It should be the happiest feeling ever, right?</p><p>It’s been a while since I last stood on a stage, so I’m worried that I might not sing well! That’s why I practiced! I have the lyrics and everything down pat now! ♪</p><p>You see, my doctor kept stopping me when I tried to practice. So I did my best to get out of there, many times. I couldn’t bring the instruments though, so I’ve only practiced my singing, you know~?</p><p>I’m good at singing, after all! I’ll let you hear! Lalala~…♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “Sera…!”</p><p><strong>Seira:</strong> “Kya~ Oh Kuro-chan, don’t embrace me so tightly! You’re suffocating me~ (<em>cough, cough</em>) What’s wrong? Geez, have you regressed to the old baby Kuro-chan~? ♪”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> &quot;Sera… I feel bad for you, but I can’t let you stand on stage.</p><p>When I hug you like this, I can tell. You’re cold as a corpse. Your face is white as sheet too – it’s because your organs aren’t doing their job.</p><p>You’re gravely ill. It’s almost a miracle that you’re alive.</p><p>You may be temporarily ‘feeling okay’ thanks to your medications.</p><p>But I asked your doctor. He said your illness is worsening… Your medications increased, so the side effects must be tormenting you. You can’t stand properly with all the nausea and dizziness, right?</p><p>Do you really think… you can stand on stage, perform, and sing in that state?</p><p>Sera, listen to me. We can hold live shows anytime. So can you give up on this one?&quot;</p><p><strong>Seira:</strong> &quot;…</p><p>…Why?</p><p>Ufu, fufufu… You ‘<em>can’t let me stand on stage</em>’, Kuro-chan? ‘<em>Give up on this one</em>’? Who do you think you are~? Kuro-chan, you’re my sub-leader, right?</p><p>And I’m your leader, right? I taught you everything! Songs, music – <em>everything</em>!</p><p>You couldn’t even do anything! Just a freaky girl who only ever stared at me from the corner of the classroom!</p><p>So why are you being so mean to me… hey, Kuromori-san?&quot;</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> &quot;Sera… Yeah, it’s just as you said.</p><p>I can’t do anything without you. You were the one who clasped my hand, hugged me… and led me to that shining stage.</p><p>I bet my middle school self wouldn’t believe even if I tell her. That I would get to be treated like a friend by the radiantly sparkling girl I admired… I’m the luckiest girl.</p><p>I’m so blessed… So I want to split my happiness with you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Seira:</strong> &quot;Kuro-chan… I-I’m so sorry. That’s not it, I didn’t mean to say such cruel things to you! I love you, Kuro-chan! I love you, love you so much…!</p><p>So… okay? Don’t take it from me! Please! These days, I can barely even stay awake! I have nothing but singing anymore! Singing, playing music… and then nothing!</p><p>They’re the only things connecting me to this world! Do you know my middle school friends won’t even visit me anymore!? Can you believe that? And I was so popular back then!</p><p>Like I was the center of the world. Always smiling and enjoying my days… But it’s aaaall gone now! Ahahahaha☆</p><p>All I have now is Kuro-chan… and the Rock Band Club! So… okay, Kuro-chan?</p><p>Let me sing! I want to sing! I want to siiiiiiiing…!&quot;</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> &quot;Ngguh… Stop kicking about, Sera! Uukh, my eyepatch got torn away.</p><p>I’m asking you, calm down! It’s not me I’m worried about – you’re hurting yourself! I can’t stand to watch… Please, listen to me, okay?</p><p>I love you too, Sera. Love you so, so much… When Anzu-chan went away, I couldn’t accept reality. I said so many cruel things to her, after all.</p><p>I didn’t even get to say sorry… and yet, she left. But it should’ve been the hardest on her, not me. I’m so useless. I can’t do anything, I have no worth living.</p><p>But then you picked me up, Sera. You invited me to the Rock Band Club… and gave me somewhere to belong. I could heal the scars in my heart little by little.</p><p>Now it’s your turn – no, I’ll save you this time, Sera. I’ll do anything, even offer up my heart for you. You can hit me, insult me, do anything you want if it makes you happy.</p><p>So please, hang on for a little longer and focus on your treatment… Even if it takes years or centuries or millennia… I’ll keep waiting for you. I’m with you even to the bottom of hell.</p><p>Please. This is the only thing I’ll ever ask. Don’t take Sera away from me. I’m the same; I only have my songs and music and… the Rock Band Club.&quot;</p><p><strong>Seira:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> &quot;Sera? Did she tire herself out and fall asleep…?</p><p>I’ll carry you to the hospital, okay? On my back… You’ll probably be angry with me later, though.</p><p>Huff. Uukh, she’s actually pretty heavy. I should build more strength. So that I can support Sera, Ruka and Shizu… so at least we can walk forward even if we can’t fly.</p><p>I’ll get stronger, too. So Sera… there’s no reason for you to be feeling anxious or scared. Someday, we’ll all definitely hold a live together with smiles.</p><p>Let’s make sure our song and performance reach the heavens. Throw all the curses we can think of at that nasty God. Sera, wouldn’t that be very… rock’n roll?</p><p>You were the one who told me that looong ago, Sera.&quot;</p><h2 id="azusa-himeno">Azusa &amp; Himeno</h2><h3 id="baby-pigeon-and-bear-cub">Baby Pigeon and Bear Cub</h3><p><em>Title note</em>[^3]</p><p><strong>&gt; Shopping Mall</strong></p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> &quot;I’m on a date with Himeno-chan~☆ Date with Himeno-chan~☆</p><p>…Huh?

Geez, you’re not a real infant, you knoow?”</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “_Babble, babble_♪ Mama Himeno, please coddle Azusa☆”</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> &quot;Ehehe. There, there, you good girl. You’re my treasure, Baby Azusa…♪</p><p>But I fear I’ll end up ‘squashing’ you if I’m not careful, so… I’m sorry about it really, but walk on your own, okaay?&quot;</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> &quot;Yees. Azusa doesn’t want to end up minced meat, so she’ll walk on her own☆</p><p>But I’m scared of being separated from you, Himeno-chan. So Azusa will be hugging you, okay? It’s fine as long as you don’t hug back, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> “You’re making it hard to walk, Azusa-chan. What’s wroong? You’re being more touchy-feely than usual. Did something happen? I can hear you out if you have any problems.”</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> &quot;Ahaha. Azusa just doesn’t fare too well on rainy days. They make her feel a little downcast.</p><p>There’s no Tennis Club activity on rainy days, after all. There’s nothing to do after school… Azusa feels lonely~ so very much.</p><p>So Azusa is saved that you’re coming to shop with her today, Himeno-chan ☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> “But Azusa-chan, you look like you have lots of friends. Isn’t there anyone else who’ll play with you? This is your hometown, right? So you should have middle school friends around.”</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> &quot;No, Azusa wasn’t a very sociable girl back then. Especially as a third year; all Azusa did was study. She had a very gloomy youth.</p><p>And Azusa has changed a lot from middle school, so she ended up growing distant from the girls she used to be close to…</p><p>I haven’t heard from them since we decided to head to different high schools.&quot;</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> &quot;Hmm. So you made your huge debut in high school, huh Azusa-chan?</p><p>Come to think of it, you were more fidgety when we first met. You’d stammer and fall silent sometimes, I think?</p><p>During Tennis Club practices, there were times I’d be left without a partner because I was too slow… so I called out to you, since you also got left out, right?</p><p>That’s how we became friends, wasn’t it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “Ehehe. You’re always taking care of Azusa, Himeno-chan! Azusa loooves you! Let’s be friends forever! _Chu-chu_♪”</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> &quot;You hug me and kiss me… Azusa-chan, you’re really physical, huh? I’m so strong it scares people away from me, so this is new to me♪</p><p>I’m happy. I love you too, Azusa-chan…♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “Yaay, our love is mutual! It’s okay, Himeno-chan, you can give me a kiss too! Come on, don’t be shy! Azusa will let herself be kissed, with a sparkling smile! ☆”</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> “Nn~ I’ll end up making a dent on your face if I kiss you, Azusa-chan. Stop being silly and look in front of you when you walk, okay?”</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “Yees. Tch, you always put some distance between us, Himeno-chan. It’s so lonely~ Azusa knows it’s because you don’t want to break your surroundings, but still.”</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> &quot;Ahaha. Yeah, especially in this kind of crowded place with a bunch of merchandises lined up… Feels like I might break something by accident. So I end up walking more slowly than usual.</p><p>Sorry that I’m slowing you down…&quot;</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> &quot;It’s fine. Azusa has no particular plans – so let’s have a relaxing stroll as we shop☆</p><p>There should be a sports equipment shop this way! Azusa’s a local, so she knows her way around this mall☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> “Right. The racket and everything else you’ve been using so far were borrowed from the Tennis Club… but you wanna buy your own equipment now, right?”</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “Yes. Azusa has become a true Tennis Club member body and soul! So Azusa wants her personal racket and ball! She’ll name them and tuck them in bed with her every night ☆”</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> &quot;Use your racket like a racket, please…</p><p>I’ve been playing tennis for longer than you, so I’ll see which one will be good for you. You don’t have much arm strength, Azusa-chan, so I think something light would be nice.&quot;</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “Perhaps so ☆ There was that time Azusa tried out your racket and fell from the weight on her hand, after all!”</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> “Anything lighter than that and it feels like I’m not carrying anything, which makes it conversely hard to use for me… The ones off-the-shelf are really light, so I usually wrap stone weights around them.”</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “Ahaha. Maybe if Azusa and Himeno-chan’s arm strengths are added together and then divided by two, we’ll both have ‘just about right’. Unfortunately, that’s not how it works.”</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> &quot;Maybe we can be pretty powerful if paired for doubles… Mmn, what’s wrong?</p><p>Azusa-chan, why are you looking down? Does it hurt somewhere? I’m sorry, did I break your bone where I touched you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> &quot;No, umm… There are my classmates from middle school. Azusa isn’t very good with situations like this. Back then, Azusa was a really gloomy, plain girl in glasses, you see—</p><p>It wasn’t exactly bullying, but all the flashy kids made fun of me in middle school… It will be a pain if they call out to Azusa, so let’s go to another floor before they notice.&quot;</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> &quot;It’s okaay, Azusa-chan. I’ll kick up a storm on your behalf if they say anything. So puff out your chest and hold your head high. You’re just making yourself look suspicious like that.</p><p>You haven’t done anything wrong, Azusa-chan. You don’t have to run away, or take the longer route for safety. Let’s walk straight. I’m with you, so relax.&quot;</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “Yes… ah, no I can’t! They’re whispering something about me!”</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> “Nn~… Ahaha. ‘<em>That girl is so cute. Is she a celebrity?</em>’, they said.”</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “What…?”</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> &quot;They don’t seem to notice you were their classmate. Just try waving your hand; they’re not ridiculing you, they’re looking at you with envy.</p><p>That’s amazing, Azusa-chan. You’re changing in a good direction. I have to learn from you and grow myself, on my own pace.</p><p>Instead of closing my eyes or looking away… I should face my fear and mature like you have. Hey, can we hold hands?</p><p>I’ll treat your hand with care so I won’t crush it. Can I, Azusa-chan?&quot;</p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> &quot;Himeno-chan… You’re right, thank you. Let’s hold hands ☆</p><p>As long as you’re with me, Himeno-chan… Azusa can always put on a sparkling smile ☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Himeno:</strong> &quot;Right. Your hand is so warm, Azusa-chan. It really is silly to put a distance because I’m too afraid of hurting people.</p><p>Can you tell me about your past properly, someday? Like what you said – I can accept everything with my strength…♪&quot;</p><hr><section class="footnotes">[^1]: It’s originally “Poemer and Gamer (ポエマーとゲーマー)”, which rhymes better, I guess [laughs].

This should be the end of the speech. From here on, I’ll be asking for your activity reports.</p><p>I’ll start with you, Kijishi-san. How’s your progress with the creation of the glasses that we, the student council, commissioned you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sumire:</strong> &quot;Reporting. The entire Art Club have exerted their best efforts to create a new-type glasses, and all there is left to do is the mass production.</p><p>Lightness, endurance, and design – I assure the glasses are perfect from every angle.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> “I’d expect no less from the Art Club! Surely with Saeki-san’s genius art skills and the innate power of glasses combined, the final product would rise as the first star of the glasses world.”</p><p><strong>Sumire:</strong> &quot;It’s an honor.</p><p>But is it all right? That I am bestowed the title of a student council officer, instead of my seniors in the Art Club… I’m worried that they don’t think well of me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> &quot;You don’t have to worry, Kijishi-san.</p><p>I did not choose you as a member of my student council because you’re in the Art Club. The fact that you are here right now… was because my first sight of your glasses had electrified me so.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sumire:</strong> “Hmm. I don’t believe I truly comprehend, but in other words, is it all thanks to glasses?”</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> &quot;Precisely. That is simply the way of things… My will was of no importance; we are all puppets dancing atop the lenses of the great eyeglasses.</p><p>Next, Konan-san. It’s time to hear your report.&quot;</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “…The Theater Club held a performance last weekend. A love-romance play about a non-glasses boy falling for a glasses girl. Well, it seems like we did pretty well.”</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> “And yet, you do not seem very thrilled. Is something bothering you, Konan-san?”</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> &quot;Hah! I’m sure you don’t need me to tell you.</p><p>I won’t let you say you’ve forgotten about her. My close friend, who was forced to transfer after the persecution she experienced because she didn’t wear glasses…</p><p>You know, Student Council President? Each time a play that glorifies glasses succeeds, I think this:</p><p>If this regime, this ideology had spread earlier, I wouldn’t have to lose a friend…!&quot;</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> &quot;…!</p><p>I thought so. You are chasing after her shadow, even now…</p><p>The shadow of our friend, Anzu-san.</p><p>…No, <em>Lenzu</em>-san. That was our affectionate nickname for her; our friend who’s no longer here.&quot;</p><p><strong>Hotori:</strong> “Zzz, zzz…♪”</p><p><strong>Sumire:</strong> “E-Excuse me. Who is this ‘Lenzu-san’?”</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> &quot;…I will tell you when the time comes.</p><p>Our first priority now is to spread the wonders of glasses even deeper, as to strengthen our regime.</p><p>I don’t want to create another victim like Lenzu-san. Never again.</p><p>…Konan-san. It pains me to keep making someone with an artistic soul like you to do plays that propagate glasses, but—</p><p>Please, lend me your strength for a little longer, for the sake of our common desire.&quot;</p><p><strong>Yako:</strong> “…Hmph.

My vision is suddenly a lot clearer, for some reason. T-That’s strange… The test says I should have no problem with my eyesight.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> &quot;Fufu. You must be surprised. I was as well, upon hearing Transfer Student-san’s story.</p><p>Apparently, your friend from the same Volleyball Club – Hotta-san has been bothered by something that happens during offense drills with you.</p><p>Even though you are supposed to have good eyesight, you would sometimes fail to follow the ball during attacks.</p><p>At first, she thought it was simply due to your lack of skills. But recalling that there was no such trouble when you were first years, she rejected this possibility from the outset.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kana:</strong> “W-Why, of course! It’s absolutely impossible for <em>me</em> to suffer from lack of skills. Geez, I can’t believe that Hotta!”</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> “Then why couldn’t you throw your attacks properly? Isn’t that strange?”</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> “That’s true. You’ve been incessantly throwing attacks at me, Umezono-senpai, but none of them managed to hit. And you’re definitely not the type to miss on purpose…”</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> “Fufu. Exactly. I have been watching since a while ago, and it did not look like she was trying to miss on purpose.”</p><p><strong>Kana:</strong> “Can you get to the point? I still have no idea why these glasses fit me.”</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> “…The answer is simple. Umezono-san, you have astigmatism.”</p><p><strong>Kana:</strong> “…Astigmatism?”</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> “Indeed. This is what the school nurse told me, but Umezono-san ― it seems you were diagnosed with astigmatism on your eyesight test.”</p><p><strong>Kana:</strong> &quot;Ah… That’s right, I forgot. But even with a little astigmatism, I never had problem seeing, so I didn’t let it bother me…</p><p>This means I need glasses too, huh?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> “Yes, exactly. And as long as you believe in glasses, they will never betray you.”</p><p><strong>Kana:</strong> “T-Thank you very much, President. Thanks to you, I feel that I can finally try my hardest to take that regular spot.”</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> “Fufu. It’s fine. The one you should thank is him – he picked a pair of glasses that would suit you immediately after hearing about your astigmatism.”</p><p><strong>Kana:</strong> &quot;…T-Thank you, transfer student.</p><p>Fufu. I’m feeling a lot better now. Hey, Nekozuka, you’ll keep accompanying me through the attack drill, won’t you?</p><p>Brace yourself; this time, I’ll keep my glasses on the ball and aim straight at you♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> “Eh! S-So I’m being sacrificed either way!? That’s not fair!”</p><p><strong>Sakura:</strong> &quot;Fufu. We can deem the case closed, then…♪</p><p>Our propagation of glasses have been a smooth sailing, thanks to you.</p><p>Only a little more until our plan comes due. Let’s brace ourselves… no, our glasses, and persevere♪</p><p>…As it happens, Transfer Student-san—</p><p>…No, never mind.</p><p>Rather than that, we should return home for the day, before it’s dark. Omnipotent glasses may be, they are powerless before the darkness of night.</p><p>Transfer Student-san, I thank you for your excellent work today.

That girl likes to vanish sometimes.</p><p>Probably just patrolling the school for anything that may catch her glasses. To see if there’s any scoundrel planning something bad out there.</p><p>No matter how bad someone is, there’s definitely purity somewhere deep inside their heart. That’s what the student president believes, that people are bad because their hearts’ glasses become clouded.</p><p>Just like how you saved that Volleyball Club gal, people will surely see the right way if we can wipe their inner glasses clean. So she’s trying to help with that.</p><p>Does that come as a surprise? Well, gotta admit we dunno what the president’s thinking either, despite being part of her student council. But she won’t ever suppress people for not wearing glasses.</p><p>She’s only protecting us from anti-glasses people. The whole stuff about glasses-ifying the entire student body is just a way for her to keep the glasses extremists on her side.</p><p>So she won’t ever force glasses on people. She just gives the students glasses to clear up their grievances.</p><p>Even if said student has strayed too far from the path. But you change glasses, and your entire life may change in the process.</p><p>So ‘<em>Keep calm and have these glasses</em>’, she’ll tell 'em.</p><p>Well, no idea how the other stuco officers besides the president and I feel, though.</p><p>I mean, Konan-chan looks to me like she’s gonna do a coup d’etat one of these days☆</p><p>Ahaha.

Look, loOK! I’ve got you a kusogE~☆”</p><p><img alt="Natsume &amp;amp;amp; Sora" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/d7NTV6F.jpg"></p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “&lt;HaHa~♪&gt; Sora is happy to see you look so happy, Shisho!</p><p>And that’s perfect timing~!</p><p>Sora invited Yuuki-sense over today! When you think of kusoge, you think of Yuuki-sense, right~?”</p><p><img alt="Makoto" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/QDljlLB.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eh, what does that mean!? I don’t know but I feel like I’ve been dissed!?”</p><p><strong>Natsume:</strong> “Of course NoT, Yuuki-kun♪</p><p>You possess steely endurance that enables you to play on tirelessly and aim for completion, even when faced with bugs and hell-like button smasHiNG.</p><p>Isn’t that rigHT, former Game Club member, Legendary High Score Expert… Yuuki-kun?♪</p><p>I know that until now, you’ve played through a great many kusoge, that normal people would have given up on within minuTEs…</p><p>…and cleared them, while giving an impression that’s dubious of your saniTy: “Eh? I thought that was pretty fun?”</p><p>And so valuing your accomplishments and abilities, today I have brought you a special kusoge to plAY!</p><p>Now, will you be able to clear this onE…!?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “&lt;HiHi~♪&gt; There’s nothing to worry! Yuuki-sensee will definitely see it through!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Uh, guys, I’m not <em>that</em> bored!?</p><p>Why is that each time you find a new kusoge you force me to play it!? What meaning is there in this bullying!?</p><p>M-Maybe Sakasaki-kun actually hates me?”</p><p><strong>Natsume:</strong> “Of course nOT. Let me make it clear: That’s a misunderstandiNg. I have a fair amount of respect and interest towards you guys, you knOw, Trickstar♪</p><p>Well, it’s your freedom to feel like you’re being bullied, thouGH!</p><p>You are greatly mistaken if you think I am a virtuous maN, I am one of the Five Oddballs who once plunged this Yumenosaki Academy into chaOS!</p><p>Using every vicious method possible, I will kick you down to the abyss of miseRy! Fuhahahaha…☆”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “&lt;HuHu~♪&gt; Shisho is acting weird because he hasn’t been getting much sleep~”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eh, really? You need to take proper sleep, Sakasaki-kun. Our body is our tool of the trade in this industry, right?”</p><p><strong>Natsume:</strong> “I knoW. But when I’m taken in by my research, potions and all that, I kinda forget the time, you seE…</p><p>I was thinking that love potion, which has been a persisting subject of research since the old times, might be of use for my idol activitIEs.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eehh!? Love potion?</p><p>I-I think love caused by drugs isn’t true love!”</p><p><strong>Natsume:</strong> “I wonder. Love is in the end a physiological process that can be chemically explaInED… Haven’t you read <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>?</p><p>That’s okay, thouGH. Different people have different definitions of loVE.</p><p>…Anyway, I think I seriously need that sleEP, so I’ll go ahead and take my rest, okaY?</p><p>I’ll be taking a nap at my secret studY, so I’ll let Sora deal with the gueST.</p><p>As the head of this club, I know I should be the one to welcome you, thoUgH.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, don’t worry about me. I just happened to bump into Harukawa-kun in the corridor, where he then invited me to come over and play for a bit… that’s all.</p><p>I’m not exactly a guest, and it’s not that I had any particular business. Get your sleep, Sakasaki-kun.</p><p>…You really look like you’re having a hard time.”</p><p><strong>Natsume:</strong> “Are you actually sharp or dense… I wish you’d pick one and settle with iT.</p><p>Well, whateVeR. Then I’ll take you up on the offer and get some sleEp~♪</p><p>FarewelL. Don’t hesitate to wake me up if there’s trouBLe.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “&lt;HeHe~♪&gt; Sweet dreams, Shisho~!”</p><p>&gt; <em>Natsume leaves.</em></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. Just when I thought he finally showed up, he left in no time, that Sakasaki-kun. He’s really a tough one to grasp.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Really? But Shisho is always oozing a different ‘color’ from other people――</p><p>Umm, I mean ‘color’ as in for smell! Anyway, he’s always oozing that, so Sora finds him easy to grasp~”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah… Come to think of it, I guess Sakasaki-kun always has this strange fragrance coming from him.</p><p>Is it from some aromatics? He gives off different scents at different days too, doesn’t he?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Yes! He’s a little tired today, so he’s wearing a really strong ‘color’ to hide it~”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Sakasaki-kun is looking pretty busy, isn’t he~? Switch has been frequenting even in official matches lately… Should you really be playing games, Harukawa-kun?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “It’s okay! Clubs are part of the ‘ordinary life’! It’s exactly because of the ordinary that the unordinary can shine!</p><p>That’s what Shisho said! Impurity and purification and something-something!</p><p>So Sora will play a whole lot today too! With a sparkling smile…☆</p><p>First, let’s get to the kusoge that Shisho brought for us!</p><p>It seems it can be played by two, so can Sora play too?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Of course. I’m not part of the Game Club anymore, so the game consoles and their softwares and everything else belong to you guys.</p><p>You don’t have to ask my permission for anything. Just do as you like, Harukawa-kun~♪</p><p>I’ll do my best for our co-op play so I won’t get in your way.</p><p>I’m so excited~ Kusoge are like, almost physically impossible to beat, so I can play them on and on♪”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “&lt;HoHo~♪&gt; So that’s why it’s become that ‘when you think of kusoge, you think of Yuuki-sense’, huh~?</p><p>Because Yuuki-sense beats normal games too fast!</p><p>But Sora thinks beating it isn’t all there is to enjoy a game~? How about taking the time to enjoy the light and sound more?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Different people have different ways of enjoying games ― just like with definitions of love, I think…</p><p>Aha, I just tried to say something deep by borrowing Sakasaki-kun’s words♪”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Yuuki-sense seems very excited~ He looks like he’s having fun! But that’s a given~ because ‘games’ are ‘play’!</p><p>We’re still children, so we love to play! Just like Shisho and Sense, Sora also loves games very much!</p><p>Let’s all play a lot! Let’s play, forgetting the time, for as long as that’s allowed for us! &lt;HaHiHuHeHo~…♪&gt;”</p>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Desc:</strong> Ran Nagisa substories unlocked for free before Revenge Match.</p><p><strong>Written by:</strong> Akira<br><strong>Timeline:</strong> Fall</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="first-substory">First Substory</h2><p><strong>&gt; Front Gate</strong></p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/qtRohrz.jpg"></p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> (… …</p><p>…It’s been so long, Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>…You haven’t changed one bit. No, maybe it’s more lively compared to when I was here?</p><p>…Everyone is smiling.</p><p>…That’s great.</p><p>… …)</p><p>“…? Do you need something from me? Yes, you.</p><p>…Eh, Anzu-san? The producer, Anzu-san?</p><p>…You came here to pick me up?</p><p>…Wait.</p><p>…(<em>intently reading from some kind of booklet</em>)</p><p>…Thanks for waiting. Umm—</p><p>‘Good work coming to get me.’</p><p>‘I am the ruler of Shuuetsu Academy, Ran Nagisa of Adam.’</p><p>…Pause.</p><p>‘All idols besides me shall fall to ruins.’</p><p>…Ah, wait.</p><p>…It says I should make the most intimidating face I could muster. And laugh loudly too, it seems?</p><p>…I’ll redo. Sorry, okay?</p><p>‘Fuhahahaha! All idols besides me shall fall to ruins!’</p><p>‘There is no path before me, for my trail <em>makes</em> the path! I am the most sublime king! The eternal idol!’</p><p>‘Kneel, plebeians! Before the radiance of Ran Nagisa! Fuhahahaha!’</p><p>…Nailed it! (<em>victory pose</em>)</p><p>…Ah, sorry. I must’ve surprised you. You see, I’m in the middle of forming my character.</p><p>…But since I’m not used to it yet, I’m practicing.</p><p>…I resigned from idol activities for a while, you see.</p><p>…Wandering around foreign countries for a little self-seeking journey.</p><p>…But that made me lose sight of my ‘self’ instead.</p><p>…To the point I even forgot how to speak Japanese.</p><p>…But Hiyori-kun told me. ‘Let’s do our best together again.’</p><p>…So I came back. To this country.</p><p>…Honestly, I don’t feel like it.</p><p>…Now and then, the idol industry is always so brutal.</p><p>…I dislike participating in feuds, you see.</p><p>…I wonder why we can’t all be friends.</p><p>…I wonder, why we can’t all love and sympathize with one another.</p><p>…Even though we’re all family, born to the same planet.</p><p>…Maybe it’s because we’re weak?</p><p>…Ah, sorry. That’s not something I should ask you, Anzu-san.</p><p>…Umm, will you lead me to the student council room?</p><p>…Yeah, I was thinking to drop by for a greeting before Autumn Live.</p><p>…It seems it’ll be held in our territory,</p><p>…so maybe it’s more suitable that <em>they</em> come to greet us.</p><p>…But I wasn’t in the country for some time.</p><p>…So I wanted to see, feel, and grasp the current state of Yumenosaki.</p><p>…And I thought it’s just proper to be coming for a greeting since we’re going to borrow the Yumenosaki kids.</p><p>…I need to see Eichi-kun, too.</p><p>…He’s kind of a schemer, that one. I need to have a look at his face myself, to find out what he’s thinking.</p><p>…Plus, it’s going to be awkward to meet him after everything is over.</p><p>…So I’m thinking of apologizing <em>before</em> the event.</p><p>…Trickstar, is it? The group we’re doing a joint live with.</p><p>…I want to tell him – I’m sorry if I end up breaking those kids.</p><p>… …</p><p>…What’s wrong? Please, lead the way to the student council.</p><p>…I used to go to Yumenosaki too, but I’ve forgotten most things about it.</p><p>…If you won’t take me there, I’ll get lost.</p><p>…I get lost easily – no, I get swept easily.</p><p>…Maybe I’m too empty? I seem to be missing many things.</p><p>…So, I trust you to lead the way.</p><p>…Come on? Let’s go.</p><p>…Umm.</p><p>…Sorry, what was your name again?”</p><h2 id="the-fruit-of-knowledge">The Fruit of Knowledge</h2><p><strong>&gt; Adam Personal Parlor</strong></p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Pardon!</p><p>Saegusa Ibara, arriving to relay a message! Do excuse the intrusion during your busy time!</p><p>However, I ask that you lend me your ears for five – no, even just a minute!</p><p>I promise no loss! Salute~!”</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/9I3thQQ.jpg"></p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Ibara.</p><p>…What’s wrong?</p><p>…I don’t get it, but wait.</p><p>…I’ll finish reading in a little while.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Understood! I shall wait!</p><p>Except Your Excellency’s ‘little while’ can last up to three days or even a week, so standing at attention until you are done does bring me quite a few worries!</p><p>However, if that is an order! Then Saegusa Ibara, your humble servant, shall wait even if it rains water or spears!</p><p>Subordination! Fealty! Service! A-ha-ha♪”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I don’t need servants.</p><p>…What I want is an equal I may love.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Copied! If that is your wish, then I shall work hard to behave like so!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…You’re a hard worker, Ibara.</p><p>…Okay. Sorry for the wait. I’m done reading so I’ll hear you out. What is it?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Ooh, wonderful! Fine weather comes to those who wait…☆”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Fine weather – is that about Hiyori-kun? He’s coming?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “A-ha-ha♪ I’d expect no less, Your Excellency – such interesting things you say! Ahh, my stomach hurts! I’m dying, I’m dying~!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…When you exaggerate like that, it feels like you’re making fun of me.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Pardon! It’s a habit! In this country, where weapons are banned, the act of non-violence and subordination are the greatest strategy to survival!</p><p>Slay with praise and kill with looks! The customer is god! A-ha-ha♪”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Do you want to kill me?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Ridiculous! I need you to live a long life, Your Excellency! For the sake of my long term plan <em>and</em> the future of the idol industry!</p><p>In any case! I would feel sorry to waste your time with idle chat when you prematurely ended your reading for me!</p><p>So I shall state my business!</p><p>As per usual, I have finished coming up with Your Excellency’s lesson schedule to match with Eden’s coming plans!</p><p>Please run your eyes through it! Here you go~☆ (<em>offers a booklet</em>)”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Ah, thanks for always, Ibara.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Oh no, no need to thank me! To be of service to Your Excellency is my joy! Nay, I was born for that very reason!</p><p>Anyway, to sum it up, I came up with this training menu based on Your Excellency’s recent state and Eden’s schedule!</p><p>Steps are taken and all is set!</p><p>Your muscle ratio has slightly deviated from measurement, so let us work towards returning the balance!</p><p>Take a look at this line graph! See? We must accentuate your abdomen more and slim down your shoulders!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> &quot;…Aah, so I did end up gaining more muscle on my shoulders and back.</p><p>…Just recently, I unearthed some interesting things from a dig site neighbor, you see.</p><p>…As the discoverer, I was given a chance to examine just one on my own.</p><p>…I thought I mustn’t break it, so I carried it myself, and I guess I gained muscles because of that.</p><p>…I grow up very fast, after all.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> &quot;How wonderful! You are undergoing growth spurt even at this age, Your Excellency!</p><p>But I still don’t understand that hobby of yours.</p><p>That excavated artifact you speak of is <em>that</em>, yes? That thing in the corner, which appears to be a stone pillar carved with mysterious writings?</p><p>It does look to have cultural and historical value, but no artistic or monetary one, as far as I can see?&quot;</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Archaeology is romance. You can’t assign value to dreams.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> &quot;A difference between our sense of values, then? Archaeology requires money anyway, and instead of digging up layers of the past, I wish to build a bridge towards the future!</p><p>Not that I desire to object to Your Excellency’s hobby!&quot;</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> &quot;…Yes. It’s work, and you did your best thinking up the schedule and such, Ibara.</p><p>…So I’ll do my best to obey. But personally, I want to use my time for my hobbies more.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> &quot;<em>Obey me</em>? You jest! All I wish is to aid Your Excellency to reach greater heights, for you are the entertainment industry’s greatest asset!</p><p>I wish that you don’t doubt the sincerity of my feelings – my <em>loyalty</em>!&quot;</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…It’s fine, you know. I don’t mind being used as you see fit.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> (Hmmm. Servile as ever – or rather, he has none of the pride or dignity that tends to come with gift.</p><p>He readily obeys me without having to be talked into it, just like a baby.</p><p>Yet his work rate, output quality, and learning ability are far more than the average human can dream to have.</p><p>I see books piled up high in the corner that I don’t believe were there when I checked up on him in the morning…</p><p>But he must’ve finished perusing them all and even has their entire content remembered.</p><p>What an average man needs years to learn, he can digest in the span of a day or so.</p><p>Yet, he uses that ability to examine an artifact of no value.</p><p>Aah, what a waste! I must utilize his natural attributes, his talents, more beneficially!</p><p>I must give them back to the world! He is sitting on a gold mine!</p><p>Fortunately, this fearsome ‘weapon’ is in my hands!</p><p>I, Saegusa Ibara, shall utilize you to the fullest! With all my love and utmost caution…!)</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…What’s wrong? You’re grinning; did something good happen?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “No, no! I am merely relishing in the joy and fortune of having met you, Your Excellency! Aah, what a blessed man I am…☆”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> &quot;…I see. Few have told me that, so that makes me happy.</p><p>…I hope you’ll stay my friend, Ibara.</p><p>…Also, the documents here aren’t enough. Go and supply me with the books I’ve listed in this memo.</p><p>…Until they’re delivered, I’ll train like you tell me to.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> &quot;Yes! Then please do that!</p><p>All for the sake of our brilliant future! Charge! Raid! Conquest! A-ha-ha ♪&quot;</p><h2 id="former-kings">Former Kings</h2><p><strong>&gt; Near the Fountain</strong></p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Hello.</p><p>…I seem to run into you quite a lot. Umm… Anzu-san, was it?</p><p>…It seems we’re tied through something.</p><p>…Ah, can you wait a bit? I might need to redo; I forgot to act in-character.</p><p>…Eh? I don’t need to? It just confuses you?</p><p>…Does it. I’m glad to hear that, actually. It’s tiring to force myself to act like somebody else.</p><p>…Anyway, I’m sorry, but can you take me to the student council office?</p><p>…Yet again, I forgot how to get there. I’m sorry for troubling you again.</p><p>…A chauffeur Ibara assigned to me took me until the Yumenosaki front gate.</p><p>…But if I recall correctly, it’s against rules to bring vehicles within the school grounds.</p><p>…Eh? It’s fine to bring motorbikes and cars inside now?</p><p>…Ah, I see. They reformed the rules. That slipped my mind completely.</p><p>…I’m so hopeless. I need to remember to renew my memory more often.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Oh? Uwaah! Is that you, Nagisa-kun?”</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/kQnQB44.jpg"></p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Nn? Ah, it’s you, Tsumugi-kun.</p><p>…It’s been a while. I’m glad; you seem well.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “That’s <em>my</em> line! I am so glad to see in you good health~ Nagisa-kun♪</p><p>What are you doing here? Don’t tell me you’re coming back to Yumenosaki because you’ve had enough with Shuuetsu?</p><p>As if, huh? Adam – no, Eden seem to be really thriving…</p><p>I’m getting a little anxious honestly, since it feels like being left behind by old teammates.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I wonder? I don’t know about social reputation, and I don’t really care.</p><p>…Rather than that, I have business with the student council, you see.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ah, so you’re lost like always?</p><p>That’s not good at all~ You need to learn your way around your own daily needs! You can’t leave it all to other people – it’s them who’ll have a hard time being around you!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Yes. I know, but I can’t bring myself to care.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. You haven’t changed, Nagisa-kun~ I guess that’s fine; if you’ll have me, I can show you until the student council office. Let’s go, it’s this way~♪”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Thank you. You haven’t changed either, Tsumugi-kun; ever so kind.</p><p>…That’s how it is, so… Sorry, I’ll have Tsumugi-kun take me to the council room.</p><p>…You can go, Anzu-san. I’m sorry for taking your time.</p><p>…See you again – perhaps? At a different place, if we do have ties.”</p><p><strong>&gt; Student Council Room</strong></p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Excuse me~”</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/X8UyHkF.jpg"></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Nn?—Huh! Tsumugi… W-What’s the matter? Do you need something from the student council?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “What’s with the suspicious behavior, Eichi-kun? I don’t need anything, but I found Nagisa-kun in the school grounds so I showed him the way!”</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/EJSXHod.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Nagisa-kun? Nagisa-kun is here? Uwaah, what a fine weather…☆”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Huh, Hiyori-kun!? Why are you here!? Are you guys holding an ex-<em>fine</em> reunion party or something?</p><p>I-I wasn’t told about this…!”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “No no, it’s pure coincidence. I think. At the very least, I didn’t plan this… What sort of trick of fate is this, in fact?</p><p>Well, no matter. Nagisa-kun, don’t stand around; come on in.</p><p>I just prepared some tea, so perhaps we can rekindle old friendships while taking a few sips? Let’s have a fun chat over tea about the good old times.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Eeh~? That sounds like it’ll get dark, so no thank you!</p><p>Let’s talk about brighter things, things that have more love! Like my secretly raising this little puppy Jun-kun picked up the other day!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Pets are allowed in your dorm, Hiyori-kun?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Well, no, actually? But that little puppy is just sooo cute!</p><p>Since it was so pitifully frail, it didn’t feel quite right to kick it out, so I’ve been raising it in secret, doing everything to hide it from the dorm mother!</p><p>Look, I took so many pictures! The name is Bloody Mary…☆”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Breaking rules is no good. I think. Not that I can talk down to others about that.</p><p>…This is why you’re stuck in Reimei forever.</p><p>…I want you care for the rules more to allow proper evaluation, so you can join me in Shuuetsu, Hiyori-kun.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Well, putting me aside, Jun-kun doesn’t fulfill the requirements yet, you see?</p><p>Until he’s ready for it, I shall deign to look after him from close!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Who’s more important, me or Jun?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “A difficult question, since you’re both equally important to me! Well, at least we’re together when we work as Eden―so bear with a little loneliness, okay?♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. You two are still so close.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Like the lifelong partners we are, of course! On the other hand, I see things between Eichi-kun and Tsumugi-kun have grown strained? You two won’t even meet eyes since a while ago! A foul weather…!”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “You’re touching a sore spot there. Well, we haven’t spoken like this in a while, so there’s no helping a little awkwardness here and there… right, Tsumugi?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Yes, well, I suppose? Rather than that, can we hear the reason you’re here, Hiyori-kun, Nagisa-kun?</p><p>It’s been bothering me ― this isn’t another of your strange schemes, is it… Eichi-kun?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “So little faith in me. No, apparently Hiyori-kun just came over because he happened to be nearby.</p><p>I was surprised by the sudden visit too. I wish you would say a word or two beforehand.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Why, it’s because I came up with the idea on pure whim! I happened to hear that Trickstar is doing a live in the academy today!</p><p>So I came to see how much they’ve grown since summer.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…That’s right, Trickstar. I’m here to see their live show, too.</p><p>…Since we’ll have work together soon, I want to see for myself how much worth they have.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ahh, I believe their worth would be hard to grasp at a single glance, though! Those children have quite the potential to look forward to―they’ve turned into a favorite of mine♪”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Yes. I’m curious because you said such good things about them, Hiyori-kun.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. Then, since all of us are gathered, why don’t we go see them together? I’ll book us some VIP seats.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Uhh, excuse me, don’t tell me I’m included?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Of course. The key people of <em>fine</em> who once reformed Yumenosaki, all gathering to watch the protagonists of the current era…</p><p>What a tasteful picture, don’t you think?</p><p>Even the thought is tying my stomach in knots, and perhaps Trickstar, being the ones on stage, will be even more bothered…</p><p>But well, why don’t we put some pressure on them as their predecessors?”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I’m good at oozing pressure. Or rather, I’m practicing it because Ibara told me to.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ahaha☆ You’re giving your all for something indecipherable yet again, Nagisa-kun!</p><p>But the way you properly absorb it when others would feel lost is where you’re a rare gem!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I don’t dislike putting in effort or learning. Probing an uncharted domain for a path forward is fun.</p><p>…I think it’ll be nice if I can spend forever doing that.</p><p>…It was no longer possible to do in <em>fine</em>, so I resigned.</p><p>…Because my conquest of the small world by the name of Yumenosaki Academy ended, and there was nothing left to discover.</p><p>…After judging so, I decided to put an end to it, but—</p><p>…It seems a fun story has started once more in this place of learning where dreams bloom.”</p>]]></content>

C’mon, don’t run around, Leon.</p><p>You’ve got short legs, so you’re gonna trip on the sand and fall face first if you’re not careful.</p><p>If you got sand on your fur, it’s gonna take time to wash them off, and you don’t wanna fall on seashells and get injured, do you?</p><p>'Kay. Don’t go too far now~ Can’t have the sea sweep you away.</p><p>And there! I have you now~♪ We’re going home. I bet you’re hungry, yeah?&quot;</p><p><img alt="Kaoru" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/T7pHvJa.jpg"></p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> “… …”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> (Huh? Is that the playboy?</p><p>What’s the idiot doing staring off somewhere at a place like that?</p><p>Well, not that I have anythin’ to do with that. I mean, as long as he’s not causing trouble for UNDEAD, he’s free to do as he likes.)</p><p>&quot;Whoa… Don’t struggle, Leon.</p><p>I let you run around because there’s no one at the beach, but I can’t put you down on a road without a leash.</p><p>Even if I don’t want to bind you too much. But nothing we can do about that, right? That’s the rule in human society.</p><p>Okay, there ya go. Let’s go home~…</p><p>Sorry I haven’t taken you on walks these days. UNDEAD’s been really busy, you see~ Guess whining about that is luxury, though.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> “… …”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> (Nn~… That guy really bothers me.</p><p>Doesn’t it sorta feel like he’ll just drown himself if I let him be?</p><p>‘Sakuma-senpai’ looked just like that, for a period of time.</p><p>Despite being a bubbly and frivolous idiot for the most part, he’d make that kinda face every once in a while, huh?)</p><p>“Oi, Hakaze… -senpai? What are ya doing here?”</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> “… …”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Stop ignoring me if you don’t want me to kick you, dumbass.”</p><p><img alt="Kouga &amp;amp;amp; Kaoru" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/8noFAmY.jpg"></p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> &quot;Owah!? What’s the point of the warning if you <em>already</em> kicked me?</p><p>You’ll have to learn more of the ways of human society, Wan-chan♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Don’t call me ‘Wan-chan’, I’m not a damn dog… Stop making me repeat that; you guys are a pain, all of you.”</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> &quot;What’s wrong? You seem to be in a foul mood, huh~? Actually, don’t you get tired being so angry all the time?’</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Hah. It’s healthier for me to yell all the time, y’know.</p><p>And whose fault is it that I’m always angry, anyway? Haah?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> “Eh? Sakuma-san’s, right? Wan-cha… Should I call you Kouga-kun? Kouga-kun, I don’t really talk to you, right~?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Your existence in itself is a source of stress for me, I’ll have you know…</p><p>I don’t mind if you talk to me more; we’re still comrades of the same unit.</p><p>Well, not that I’ve approved you as one of us.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> &quot;Eh, what the – that makes so little sense? So should I act like we’re comrades or strangers? Which is it?</p><p>I hate having to be tactful for the sake of a man, so can I get the right answer upfront?</p><p>Sorry~ It must be because I’m barging in on the love nest of you and Sakuma-san, right?</p><p>I’ll leave if you think I’m annoying. I have no particular affection for UNDEAD anyway.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Haa? Did you just say you have no affection for UNDEAD, you shithead?</p><p>Who the hell says you can sing with us with that kinda half-hearted stance!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> &quot;Hmm, he gets angry with me whatever I say… Feels like treading on eggshells~ Or maybe Kouga-kun and I just aren’t compatible the slightest?</p><p>But I don’t like arguing or being yelled at, so I prefer not to be making waves~?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Look, it’s true we’re not a circle of friends, so you don’t have to act closer than you want to. I’m not good with that interpersonal relations stuff either.</p><p>I don’t get etiquettes, so if I did something that offended you, then I’m sorry, Senpai.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> &quot;Eh, why is he suddenly acting so upstanding? I don’t get this kid at all…</p><p>The corgi – is that your dog, Kouga-kun?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “My dog, or more like my <em>family</em>. The name’s Leon. Handsome, yeah?♪”</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> &quot;How am I expected to tell a pretty dog from an ugly one~? And getting introduced to a dog doesn’t make me happy. I’ll welcome your beautiful mom or sister, though.</p><p>…This little guy doesn’t bite, does he? Can I pet him?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Sure. You like animals?”</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> &quot;Yeah, pretty much. They don’t speak, and they take a liking on us just for feeding them, right?</p><p>Plus, liking animals makes for a gentle impression apparently, so it scores me points with the girls~♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;That’s all you ever talk about…</p><p>Rather than that~ In the end, what were you doing here? The sea breeze ain’t good for your health. When you get sick, it’s the whole group that bears the brunt of it, y’know?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> “Nah~… I wasn’t doing anything in particular. I was looking at the sea.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;The heck? Well, you did say you like marine sports ― I think it was in an interview job.</p><p>But it’s still too early into the year to play at the sea, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> &quot;Yup. Cold, isn’t it~? In many different meanings. To top it off, Wan-chan just <em>had</em> to up and talk to me. Ahh, worst day ever.</p><p>I wish I’d gone straight home instead~♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “…You got a reason for not wanting to go home? You’re pretty much saying that. Did you get in a fight with your parent?”</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Not gonna force you to talk or anything.</p><p>…Senpai, want to drop by my place?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> &quot;Eh, why? Was I bringing about this lonely vibe that tickles your motherly instincts?</p><p>I use that technique all the time, so I’m probably doing it out of habit~ Ahaha♪</p><p>Getting invited to a guy’s house doesn’t make me happy the slightest, so I think I’ll politely decline♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;What the hell’s wrong with your head, playboy?</p><p>I’m gonna wash Leon since it’s been a while, but he likes to struggle so it’s gonna be tough doing it on my own.</p><p>I was just thinking I could use your help.</p><p>Better use of your time than daydreaming on the beach, right? I’ll cook you dinner in return.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> “Eh~… While that may be the best reward ever had you been a girl, Kouga-kun, I’m not happy at all due to the existence of the thing attached your crotch, sorry~♪”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;It’s not like I could choose my sex. Stop complaining 'bout something we both can’t help.</p><p>Just come already. Leaving you here like you are now just feels eerie, y’know.</p><p>I’ll forcefully drag you outta here even if you refuse. Got any complaint, twit?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> &quot;I have nothing but complaints, but… oh well.</p><p>I’m losing so much face getting my underclassman to worry about me like this. This feels so pathetic. I <em>do</em> kind of want company, so I guess I can go along with you.</p><p>Kouga-kun, where’s your home?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;That way. I’m gonna shop for livingwares on the way, so you’ll have to carry the bags for me.</p><p>And stay with Leon while I’m inside the shop. He seems to be softening up to you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> “Eh~… What the heck? That sounds like such a pain. Rather than being liked by millions of boys and dogs, I wanna have the love of just one girl~”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Never said a word about <em>liking you</em>.</p><p>Who cares, just get moving! What are you, a damn jellyfish? Is it because you’ve got no bones that you’re being all wishy-washy like that?!&quot;</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> &quot;Okay, okay. Stop barking at me, Wan-chan…</p><p>Ah geez. I can’t even stare at the sea in peace. Woe is me, ahaha♪&quot;</p><h2 id="aoi-hinata">Aoi Hinata</h2><h3 id="a-spell-of-change">A Spell of “Change”</h3><p>Title note<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>.</p><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Summer</p><p><strong>&gt; Downtown</strong></p><p><img alt="Hinata" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/7HVpNRa.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> &quot;Ooi, Anzu-saan♪</p><p>Hello there! What are you up to~? You look like you’re lost; I’m familiar with the streets around here so I can show you the way if you want?</p><p>Hehe, you’re wondering why I can tell that you’re lost?</p><p>Then allow me to explain! Get ready for the great deduction of Aoi Hinata, the smart Onii-chan of 2wink~☆</p><p>Hnn? ‘So you’re Hinata-kun’? Ah, you had no idea, ma’am…?</p><p>Keep in mind, I’m the energetic one. You need to be able to tell us apart, okay~?</p><p>I might not care much, but Yuuta-kun does.</p><p>Fufu, anyway… Anzu-san, you kept staring at a map, so I could tell at a glance that you’re lost. Elementary, my dear Watson.</p><p>Ahaha. Look at you, clapping your hands all impressed~ Sure feels like being treated like a kid, which pisses me off♪</p><p>Ah well. Where do you want to go, Anzu-san?</p><p>Mm-hmm. A place that sells the necessary tools for making costumes? Kiryuu-senpai recommended it to you?</p><p>Ah~ this store? It’s hard to find since it’s on a backstreet, huh. I’ll show you the way~ Follow me! Over here, over here♪</p><p>Nnn? Ah, I came here to buy ingredients for dinner, that’s all~</p><p>So I’ll tag along with your shopping, Anzu-san. Wouldn’t hurt to make the Producer owe me♪</p><p>Right. Our dad isn’t really the housework type, so I do most of the work around the house, since I’m the Onii-chan.</p><p>Even chores can be pretty fun once you’re used to it, don’t you think~?</p><p>Fufu! Commendable, right? Most Wanted Idol to be Made Husband~? But sorry!</p><p>You can’t fall for me~ 'Cuz I’m gonna marry Yuuta-kun☆</p><p>Oh? Hey, Anzu-san, are you listening?</p><p>Sorry. I seem to have this habit of speaking really fast. When I talk with someone that’s not Yuuta-kun, I sometimes end up leaving them behind in the conversation.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “~…♪”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> &quot;Oh? That’s Sora-kun! So you were just busy staring at him, Anzu-san~?</p><p>I wonder what Sora-kun is up to. He’s sitting on a chair by the roadside~ Ever the weird boy♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> &quot;Hmm~? Huh, Hina-chan♪</p><p>Hello! Sees a friend, so greets!&quot;</p><p><img alt="Sora &amp;amp;amp; Hinata" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/nTb8Erc.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Hello~♪ What are you doing, Sora-kun?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> &quot;&lt;HaHa~♪&gt; Sora is watching the place~</p><p>Ahem! Shisho sometimes does fortune-telling by the roadside! Sora is helping him~&quot;</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Wow, that’s commendable of you. There, there♪”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> &quot;Thank you! When petted, pleased!</p><p>&lt;HiHi~♪&gt; There hasn’t been any customer today, so Shisho went to attract some~</p><p>It’s boring to just sit around, so how about a session of fortune-telling?&quot;</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Hmm? So you can do fortune-telling yourself, Sora-kun?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Yes, but still in-training~♪ Oh, Anzu is here too! Anzu, how about getting your fortune told?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Wait, why do you call her with no honorific? I think it’s necessary to be respectful to your elders~ Not that I’m one to say, always being so casual with her.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> &quot;&lt;HuHu~?&gt; Is that so? Was Sora acting disrespectful? What do you think, Anzu?</p><p>&lt;HeHe~♪&gt; It’s okay to keep calling you Anzu? Thank you! Anzu is so nice~</p><p>As thanks, let’s see your fortune~ Look, tarot cards! Sora will tell your fortune with these, okay~?&quot;</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> &quot;I think Sora-kun is just eager to tell someone’s fortune.</p><p>Well, a chance like this doesn’t come by often, so why not have our fortunes told… Anzu-san?&quot;</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “&lt;HoHo~♪&gt; Then sit over there! Commencing fortune telling!”</p><p>(&lt;HaHa~♪&gt; Is Hina-chan on a date with Anzu?</p><p>Then Sora must support him like a good friend~ Senpai said that you must support people in love!)</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “? Sora-kun, you don’t happen to be up to no good, do you?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> &quot;Hm-hm-hm… Ta-da! Here are the results☆</p><p>Hina-chan and Anzu are ultra compatible! Destined lovers, meant to be together from your past lives!</p><p>Your lucky color is pink, and your lucky item is confection~♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> &quot;No, wait, why did it turn into a compatibility match for us? And that result sounds kinda fake… Sora-kun, aren’t you getting the wrong idea?</p><p>Saying something on the go, about us being ultra compatible… Don’t tease us like that. Sora-kun can be a piece of work, huh Anzu-san?</p><p>…Huh, Anzu-san? Why are you looking at me with those, uh, moist eyes?</p><p>O-Ooh my~? Are you actually the type who falls easily for fortune telling?</p><p>You’re a girl like every other, I guess. But uh, I think Sora-kun was just saying random things there? You shouldn’t take them at face value…?&quot;</p><p><img alt="Hinata" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/c8atrY6.jpg"></p><p>(W-What’s this? Feels kinda weird… I never really viewed Anzu-san as a love interest, or even a woman, but…</p><p>I think she bought Sora-kun’s fortune telling; she’s staring at me with <em>that</em> sort of eyes… I’m starting to get all self-conscious too, or more like…</p><p>…My heart’s racing.)</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> &quot;Hina-chan? What’s wrong? Did Sora say something strange…?</p><p>Hmm, was the fortune telling a failure? So as expected, Sora still has a long way to go, huh~?&quot;</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Y-Yeah. You need a great amount of time and effort to master a skill, and I think it applies to fortune-telling too. Continue your endeavors, Sora-kun!”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Yes! Sora will work super hard so he can become a magician like Shisho!”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> &quot;…Then we’ll be on our way. The shop that Anzu-san’s looking for tends to close early, so we need to hurry.</p><p>Let’s go, Anzu-san. Come on. Over here, over here♪&quot;</p><p>(Huh…? I was thinking to hold her hand to lead the way, like always, but…</p><p>I-I can’t bring myself to touch her for some reason…</p><p>Why? Did Sora-kun accidentally cast a weird spell on me when he told my fortune?)</p><hr><section class="footnotes"><ol><li>I translated it as “change”, but the 変 kanji in the title is likely a pun. 変 by itself can mean “weird” or “change”, or something unexpected occurring suddenly. The title reads 『変』の魔法 <em>“hen” <strong>no</strong> mahou</em> while in the last line Hinata says 変な魔法 <em>hen <strong>na</strong> mahou</em> for “weird spell”. 変 is also visually similar (somewhat) with 恋 <em>koi</em> which means “(romantic) love”, sharing the compound 亦 as the top. <a href="#fnref1">↩</a></li></ol></section>]]></content>

Let’s go home, Subaru.&quot;</p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/66p46iQ.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Geez, I can’t believe we had to stay out so late training for the sports festival with Chii-chan-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Whoa, it’s gotten pitch-black outside, huh?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Because we were training for like <em>three</em> competitions at once: ball-toss, scavenger hunt, and bread-snatching race. Feels like my entire body’s screaming.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Same. Training this hard right after summer break is really trying, isn’t it~?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;What was that scavenger hunt training about even? Won’t it all depend on the list we get <em>on</em> the competition?</p><p>What are we practicing if we don’t even know what we’ll get? I don’t get it~!&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yeah, and the captain came up with the most troublesome items. What was he expecting us to bring when he wrote ‘world peace’?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;I couldn’t help nodding when Takamin said <em>‘We’ll have world peace if you disappear, Morisawa-senpai.’</em></p><p><em>That</em>’s peace, alright.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Don’t say that. Captain’s always trying his best ― he’s just a little over-the-top.</p><p>But it was nice that we got to eat bread while training for the bread-snatching race♪ After school, your stomach just feels sorta empty, y’know?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Eeh~? I got sick of eating anpan!</p><p>Okay! I’m gonna ask Chii-chan-senpai to add jam bun and melonpan to the variation tomorrow!&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “C’mon now, don’t sponge off of the captain~”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…Nn?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “What’s wrong, Subaru?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Did you hear voices just now?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ehh? Don’t say spooky things. You think anyone else would stick around at this hour…?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? Wait, Sally, are you actually bad with scary stuff?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Nah, I’m pretty fine with it in manga and movies. I’m just reminded of that scary story the captain was recounting.</p><p>Doesn’t it sound realistic and creepy, coming from someone you know?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Aah, <em>that</em> story!</p><p>The one where Chii-chan-senpai saw Anzu in the school at night, and talked to her but she vanished without warning?&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “The captain ― he was trying to hide it, but he was really creeped out, wasn’t he~?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh, that was hiding it!? But it was so obvious that he was scared.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Yeah, but I think he was under the impression that he hid it well.</p><p>Anyway. It just sounded all the creepier to me that he told the story looking all scared, so――</p><p>Eek!? Is that a shadow there at that turn!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Wah~! It’s Anzu! Yahhoo, yahhoo☆”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “What, so it’s you guys. Akehoshi and Forehead.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “So you two are still at school too.”</p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/1eef4h7.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “And Gami-san and Occhan! Fancy seeing the three of you at this hour☆ What’s going on, guys?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Well, y’know how UNDEAD’s been having a bunch of live shows lately?</p><p>So we were practicing even more intensely than usual. We bumped into Anzu just as we were about to go home.&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Anzu said she came to get something she’d forgotten in the classroom. We are accompanying her because it’s late.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh~ Then we’ll tag along with you too, Anzu! ‘<em>In travelling, companion; in life, compassion</em>’, isn’t it?♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Not exactly a ‘travel’ considering the distance, but they’ve started to turn off the lights in some places, so it’s probably better that we all stick together.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I can see well in the dark, but it’s true that it is safer with more people. Having you all around will be reassuring.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Then, let’s just get moving.</p><p>Tch, man, it’s so much more annoying with a crowd. Hey Anzu. Don’t be forgettin’ your stuff! Are you a dolt?</p><p><em>‘I’m sorry’</em>? Well, can’t do nothin’ about what already passed. Just don’t repeat it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;That’s what Kouga said, but――</p><p>What he actually means is ‘<em>The night streets are full of dangers, so a girl shouldn’t wander without company</em>’. Don’t sweat it, Anzu.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Wrong! Forehead, stop pulling shit out of nowhere!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “There you go, you’re so not honest with yourself, Gami-san~♪ Poke, poke♪”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “True. Oogami has a kind heart, but it is hard to see because he is not honest.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Adonis, you bastard! And Akehoshi, stop poking my side!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “But Gami-san, you almost don’t say it anymore these days, right? That ‘<em>Are we friends? We’re not, right?</em>’ stuff. You used to say that everytime.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “That must mean he considers us friends now.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Uuuugh! Gaaaaaaah! Stop getting the wrong idea!</p><p>I’m a proud, lone wolf! I’m not gonna get touchy-feely with anyone!&quot;</p><p>.</p><p><strong>&gt; Hallway</strong></p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/OF6kZdW.jpg"></p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “There ya go, Anzu. We’re in front of the classroom. Go get your stuff.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Stay safe, Anzu☆ We’ll wait out here!”</p><p>&lt; Ten minutes later &gt;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;…</p><p>Say, Anzu ― isn’t she taking her time in the classroom? Does picking up something you forgot usually take this long?&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I guess… she <em>is</em> taking a little long.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Haa? Isn’t she just having trouble searchin’ for her stuff?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;…You don’t think she vanished on us, do you?</p><p>She can’t be the ghost Anzu that the captain was talking about…?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eeh~? You don’t say~!”</p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/0RlFD85.jpg"></p><h2 id="chapter-2"><a href="#chapter-2">¶</a>Chapter 2</h2><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, there she is! You’re so late, Anzu~ We were worried.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I see. You couldn’t find what you forgot where you thought you left it, and you had trouble looking. I’m glad you found it in the end.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Hey, you’re the real Anzu, right?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Gee, Sally. You made Anzu confused with your question.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Oi, what’re you guys going on about? What’s the whole deal about Anzu vanishing?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Well, Chii-chan-senpai said he ran into Anzu in the kitchen of the garden terrace one night, but then Anzu vanished on him.</p><p>And suddenly too, like a ghost.</p><p>That’s why we thought that Anzu might’ve vanished in the classroom.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Sounds dumb. You sure he wasn’t just sleepy and seeing things?</p><p>The vampire bastard often mistook me for his lil’ brother when he’s half-asleep too, draggin’ me into his coffin and stuff.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Ahaha, those two brothers are horrid sleepers, huh~</p><p>Anyway, don’t make such a difficult face, Anzu.</p><p>I’m sure you’re curious about a ghost who looked exactly like you, but it really might’ve been the captain seeing things.</p><p>I shouldn’t be saying that since I doubted you? Okay, so I was wrong. I won’t doubt you again, I swear.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Gami-san and Occhan don’t seem to get scared by ghost stories, huh?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Nope. One of the twins from the light music club… Hinata, he tries scaring me with ghost stories all the time, but it’s all fiction anyways.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I am concerned that physical attack may not work in case of ghostly encounters, but… I am not afraid of ghosts themselves.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Uh, don’t try to get into fight with ghosts.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha☆ You’re hilarious, Occhan♪”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “But it was in the garden terrace that the Anzu ghost popped up? Today, Hinata was sayin’ about a rumor of fireball sighting in the garden terrace, too.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I have heard of the fireball rumor as well. It seems to be part of the ‘Seven Mysteries of Yumenosaki Academy’. A classmate was talking about it.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh? What’s that, what’s that? Lemme in!”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;So, there’s this student who saw a fireball floating around the garden terrace at night.</p><p>But then the fireball suddenly came flying at him at great speed.</p><p>He closed his eyes before it hit, but even though he waited, he couldn’t feel any heat.</p><p>He opened his eyes and the fireball was already gone.</p><p>Though he got out unharmed, the hem of his uniform had a mysterious burned mark, they say.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “O-Oi, cut it out~ I’m getting chills listening to a ghost story in this darkness.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “You scared, man? Gyahahaha, what a loser!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Shut up. I can’t help what creeps me out.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Hmm, the garden terrace, huh…</p><p>Hey, let’s go see what the rumors are about!</p><p>Nah, let’s not just see but <em>catch</em> the fireball! I bet it’s all shiny and sparkling!&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;A fireball won’t exactly be sparkling but <em>blazing up</em>, y’know…? No, wait. That’s not the important part.</p><p>Subaru, I’m begging you, stop coming up with weird ideas on the spot. For real.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Hah! What a pain in the ass. Count me out. I wasn’t too excited about this whole chaperoning business in the first place.</p><p>Akehoshi, if you really wanna take a look, you can go on your own.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “No way, I wanna go with you guys! You don’t come across a fireball twice, right? What if you let this chance slide?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “I’d rather not come across it for life, seriously.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Geez, don’t be so boring, Sally. Wouldn’t you like to see it, Occhan, Anzu? The fireball!”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> &quot;Hmm. Fire is considered holy in my motherland, I believe. If I do manage to see it, it may bring me fortune…</p><p>But it’s already late. Is it not dangerous?&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;He’s right, Subaru. We have Anzu with us right now. Let’s give up for today.</p><p>Right? You wanna go home, don’t you, Anzu?</p><p>Eh? You’d like to take a look? Since you might find out the truth about the ghost who looked like you?</p><p>Well, it’s true both stories happened in the garden terrace.</p><p>Seriously~? Hey, Anzu, can’t you think it over~? I get that you’re probably curious about it, but… You’re surprisingly a stubborn one, aren’t ya?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Anzu, I love you~♪ Let’s hug! <em>Gyuu</em>-_gyuu_☆ Right!? Of course you’ll be curious, right?</p><p>Leave it to me, Anzu! I’ll definitely catch both the fireball <em>and</em> the ghost Anzu!☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;C’mon, let go of her, Subaru. Sexual harassment <em>is</em> sexual harassment regardless of your intention, 'kay?</p><p>(<em>sighs</em>)… Okay, you win. I can’t let Subaru and Anzu go by themselves. I’m going too.&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Then I will also come. It will be safer with someone to protect you. I’m the most suitable for that role in this group.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Haa!? So you’re all going anyway!?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “You can’t stop Subaru and Anzu when they’re like this. ‘<em>In for a penny, in for a pound</em>’, I guess? Aah, spare me the troublesome stuff, really.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I love you, Sally, Occhan~♪ I’ll give you a hug!”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> &quot;Don’t mind it. Fortunately, I have called home to say that I will be late because of practice. I don’t have to hurry home to do the chores today.</p><p>I will protect all of you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Subaru, don’t lean your entire weight on me~ You’re heavy.</p><p>You’ve really got to stop acting on whims. I’ll have Hokuto scold you if you’re too selfish, got it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Sally, you meanie!</p><p>Well, so we’re all heading for the garden terrace, but what about you, Gami-san~?</p><p>Are you going home alone? Or are you coming with us? I wish we can all go together~&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Stop looking at me like you expect me to come with you.</p><p>Aaugh, fine, blast it. I just need to go, right?</p><p>I’m going. What a drag!&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yay! Thanks, Gami-san☆”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Akehoshi, don’t cling to me like we’re close! You’re annoying! Shoo-shoo!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Okay then! We’re departing for the garden terrace, guys! Hip-hip-hurray~☆”</p><h2 id="chapter-3"><a href="#chapter-3">¶</a>Chapter 3</h2><p><strong>&gt; Stairs</strong></p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/FFsnNVo.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Fireball, Fireball, Mr. Firebaaall♪ Stop hiding and come out please~♪</p><p>We won’t be mean~ Don’t be scared~ Come on out~♪ &quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;<em>I’m</em> scared, okay? What if the fireball decides to grant your wish and come out?</p><p>Mnn? What, Anzu? Aah ― it’s okay, I’m fine. With this many people, I’m not as scared as I say.</p><p>Anyway, I sure hope our adventure ends with nothing happening. Thanks for worrying about me, Anzu.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Gee, you’re such a scaredy-cat, Sally! You’re scared because you keep saying it’s scary!</p><p>Times like these, you’ve got to laugh off the fear! Ahahaha~☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ah, that really sounds like the captain.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh, you’re kidding me!? No way~ Chii-chan-senpai’s the only one I don’t wanna be lumped together with~!”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Akehoshi, you’re bein’ damn noisy! Stop your yip-yap!</p><p>Anyway, I think there’s no one in this building.</p><p>My nose picks up smell better than most people, so I can tell when there’s someone nearby. I say we probably won’t be findin’ any ghosts or fireballs either?</p><p>Ha? What is it, Anzu? ‘<em>Would a ghost smell</em>’ you ask?</p><p>Why would I know, never even seen one before. That was just what my instincts said. Instincts.</p><p>Whoa! Don’t stumble, Anzu! You’re such a handful. Good that I caught your arm immediately.&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “There is barely any lighting around these parts. Everyone, watch your steps. Unlevel stairs may be hard to see.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “By the way, Occhan, what are the other things in that Yumenosaki Seven Mysteries you were saying?”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I only heard about the fireball. Do you know about the other Seven Mysteries, Oogami?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Haa? Hinata said something about… I think there was…</p><p>The Bach portrait growing a long hair, the piano playing on its own――</p><p>And then the sobs of a female student that can be heard from the rooftop at night, or something…?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hmm, so rooftop, portrait and piano~♪ Those sound interesting too!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Piano, huh…? Maybe that’s actually Ritsu?♪ That guy wanders around the school at night a lot~</p><p>You know what they say ― when you look carefully, it’s always something more ordinary than you’d think♪ &quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “And the female student at the rooftop is Sakuma-senpai? He has long hair, after all.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha, Sakuma-senpai also sticks around the school at night, so maybe you’re not off the mark. It’s not so scary when I think of it like that♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “But it’s strange to have a story about female student in Yumenosaki, huh? We only have Anzu.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Right, and I’d heard the Yumenosaki Seven Mysteries have existed before Anzu transferred here.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I guess the Sakuma-senpai theory for the rooftop ghost is pretty plausible?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;What’s wrong, Anzu? The female student wasn’t Sakuma-senpai?</p><p>Huh, you sure seem to know a lot. You have an idea about it?</p><p>Wawa―!? Anzu, don’t suddenly shake your head like that.</p><p>‘<em>I don’t know anything</em>’? Okay, okay, I got it so calm down. You’re making yourself look even more suspicious.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Keh, who cares if it’s a ghost or Ritchi or the vampire bastard. I don’t give a shit.</p><p>I don’t get what’s so scary about ghost stories. They’re just stories.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nn? Come to think of it, does anything scare you, Gami-san? It can be ghosts or roller coasters or bugs or snakes.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Haa? Nope, nada. What makes you think I’ll have one? Don’t take me for a joke!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “But everyone has a thing or two they’re scared of, right? Normally.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Get off my case. Look, I’m a great noble wolf. Who’s gonna take me seriously if lil’ things can scare me?</p><p>Heheh♪ If you <em>really</em> wanna give me a fright, show me a dinosaur the size of a mountain.&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> &quot;Hmm. Something Oogami fears…</p><p>I recall that Oogami was frightened when an angry Sakuma-senpai punished him before. I’m sorry for not coming to your rescue back then.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “What useless shit are you recalling, dumbass!? You askin’ to be knocked flying!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha☆ So the thing Gami-san’s scared of is an angry Sakuma-senpai~♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “I’m impressed you got Sakuma-senpai angry. What did you do?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Leave it. I don’t remember anymore.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> &quot;The air cooler in Sakuma-senpai’s coffin broke because Oogami was making a mess in the clubroom.</p><p>Because of that, he couldn’t sleep inside the coffin for some time ― I guess even Sakuma-senpai would get angry over that.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Daaaaaah! Damn you, Adonis! Don’t just go spilling the beans!</p><p>I broke the vampire bastard’s exhaust fan when I was acting out a kung fu movie with the twins, is all.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Eh? That coffin has an exhaust fan?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Yeah, somewhere hard to see.</p><p>Anyway, he got really angry, but I mean, I said sorry and called someone to fix it. It’s all in the past.</p><p>Plus, Adonis! You gotta confess what scares <em>you</em> first before blabbin’ about someone else’s!&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You don’t look like anything could scare you, Occhan. You’re strong, and I might’ve never seen you being caught off guard? Do you have any fear?”</p><h2 id="chapter-4"><a href="#chapter-4">¶</a>Chapter 4</h2><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “My fear? …If you must ask, I would say it is my sisters.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Huh? You’re more scared of your sisters than of ghosts?”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Isara, you must not underestimate my older sisters. They are far more terrifying than any ghosts.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “What are they like, Occhan?”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> &quot;When they find something they do not like, they would conspire with each other and tyrannize me.</p><p>But they got into a fierce dispute the other day, so I asked what was the problem.</p><p>They ended up prattling on about their minor gripes with each other that should be past; clothes being borrowed without permission, ice creams in the fridge getting eaten…</p><p>Since the fight only became more heated beyond my control, I tried to leave, but…</p><p>They all caught me before I could, and made me judge who was in the wrong.</p><p>I couldn’t pick any of them. Somehow, that ended up settling the fight, leading them to gang up on me like always…&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “W-Well… How should I put this… You have my condolences, but would you really say they’re scarier than ghosts?”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “They <em>are</em> scarier than ghosts. If you tell me to pick between fighting against a tiger or my older sisters, I will choose to fight the tiger.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Are your sisters amazonesses?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha, now you’ve got me curious. I wanna see your sisters, Occhan♪”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I would advise against that.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Still, it’s so rare to hear you talk in length, Otogari~”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Yes, I am not good at talking. But maybe I am feeling excited, to go on an adventure with you all.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah yeah, I get you, Occhan. Doesn’t wandering around the school at night just thrill you?☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “But I’m the opposite of thrilled?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Geez! Sally, you scaredy-cat!”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Hey, Akehoshi. Don’t just poke at people’s fears, you gotta put your fears out there too. You’re not bein’ fair.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Me? Lemme see~… Hmm~…”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “There’s gotta be <em>something</em>, right?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, I love sparkling things!”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “No shit, I was talkin’ about what you’re scared of! Not what you love!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Gee, it’s just a little joke.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “But you don’t seem like you’re scared of anything, Subaru. Scary stories don’t affect you, and you seem perfectly fine with the school’s night scenery.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “You are strong, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Hmm, you think so?</p><p>…&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “…?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “AAH!! That’s right!”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Eeeek!? Ba-Bastard, don’t just shout outta the blue! You gave me a shock!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Sorry, sorry. So you get surprised by people suddenly shouting, huh?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Gaaaaaah! You tryin’ to pull a fast one on me!? Who wouldn’t get surprised by sudden loud sounds!?”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Oogami, calm down. So Isara, did you realize something?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Ah right, this isn’t time to be messing with Kouga.</p><p>Well, I was thinking that the garden terrace would be locked around this hour.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh!? You mean we wouldn’t be able to go inside, even though we’ve come this far!? That’s awful~! What should we do?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Hmm, no choice but to go get the key, I think? But it’s scary~</p><p>Sorry, Subaru, can you run and get the key? You’ll be fine by yourself, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh!? Uhh~… That’s a bit…”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “…? What’s wrong, Subaru?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Uh~…”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> &quot;Ah, Akehoshi, Isara. You don’t have to worry about that.</p><p>We borrowed a spare key in case Anzu needed it to get what she forgot in the classroom. We should be able to enter the garden terrace with this.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Really? That’s great~☆ It’s thanks to you forgetting your stuff, Anzu♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ugh… When you think about how I end up in this predicament because she’d forgotten her stuff, I’m not sure if I should chalk that up to good or bad timing.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Hah! Too bad. Brace yourself for it already. You’re so pathetic, Forehead!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Look, you, just because you’re not scared…”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “In any case, we will arrive at the garden terrace soon, so what do we do? Should we start with the kitchen where ghost Anzu was sighted?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;What’s wrong, Anzu? Suddenly stopping on your track. And your face is white as sheet. Are you okay?</p><p>W-What’s wrong!? What’s throwing you off? <em>'Look over there</em>’? Where?

I don’t see ghost Anzu either.</p><p>Say Anzu, you wouldn’t happen to switch place with the ghost on the way?</p><p>Ow-ow-ow!? Sorry, sorry! Don’t hit me~&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Was that light we all saw a trick of the eyes…?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;I wonder? What <em>was</em> that, really?</p><p>Aa~h, maybe it really is impossible to catch a fireball…? I think it’ll be really sparkly, though~</p><p>…!?</p><p>Hey, did you guys hear that ‘clang, rattle, bang’ sound coming from the kitchen!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Uowaaaah!”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Ugyaaaaaa!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Sally, Gami-san!?</p><p>Eh? What is it, what’s wrong!? Why is Sally and Gami-san scampering this way out of the kitchen!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “RUN FOR IT, GUUUUYS!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eeeh, wait a second!?”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Anyway, we should listen to Isara and run. This seems to be an emergency. Let’s go, Anzu, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Y-Yeah!</p><p>W-What’s going on, seriously!? I don’t get it at all~!&quot;</p><h2 id="chapter-6"><a href="#chapter-6">¶</a>Chapter 6</h2><p><strong>&gt; Bicycle Parking Space</strong></p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/wjkzFFK.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huff… Haah…”</p><p>(I got separated from everyone else in the confusion.)</p><p>&quot;Sallyyy! Anzuuu! Gami-saaan! Occhaaan!</p><p>…Uuh, no one’s responding. What should I do?&quot;</p><p>(They… wouldn’t go home without me, would they?</p><p>I’m alone in a dark place…)</p><p>“…”</p><p>(My phone! Right, I just need to give them a call!</p><p>Contacts, starting with S… S… S… There it is! I should call Sally.</p><p>…</p><p>I’m only hearing his ringback tone. Why won’t you pick up~…? Pick up, Sally.</p><p>No, he’s not answering. Then Anzu! You’ll pick up, right Anzu?</p><p>…</p><p>Anzu’s no good too. It says her phone’s turned off…</p><p>What should I do? Occhan isn’t good with the smartphone, and he rarely ever picks up calls.</p><p>Will Gami-san pick up? But what if even Gami-san won’t answer my call?</p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/RRqZoUV.jpg"></p><p>I’ll lose all hope. And I won’t know what to do…</p><p>I’m not strong at all, guys. I’m scared of being alone in the dark…</p><p>It’s scary thinking Gami-san might not pick up my call, but I don’t like staying alone here even more… I should gather some courage and call him.</p><p>Please! Gami-san, pick up!)</p><p>&quot;…Ah!</p><p>Hello, Gami-san!? Where are you~? I got separated from everyone and got stranded in the parking space!</p><p>Right… right. You’re on your own too, Gami-san? You’re inside the school building?</p><p>Umm, hey. Gami-san, can you come get me?</p><p>Ehh!? That’s not true! I’m not ordering you around!</p><p>It’s just, umm… I’m so scared I don’t think I can go to you, Gami-san.</p><p>I didn’t say it that time, but I’m really scared of being alone in the dark.</p><p>Even though I was fine when I had everyone, I just freeze up the moment I’m alone.</p><p>I’m scared~ Gami-san, save me…&quot;</p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/nTUh8vz.jpg"></p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “And you’d laughed it off just a while back, too. So you <em>do</em> have it ― somethin’ you fear.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh!? I’m hearing two Gami-sans!?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Over here, dumbass!”</p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/LN2JTmD.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Gami-san, how come you’re in the parking space!? Teleportation!?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Are you stupid? I just walked here while taking your call.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Gami-saaan! Thanks so much!”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;Whoa! Don’t jump at me!</p><p>I swear I’ve told you over and over to stop being touchy with me!&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I know, I know. But really, thank you☆”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Keh! Anyway, you shouldn’t even hide it in the first place, you sly bastard. Just say it like it is: that you’re scared of being alone in the dark.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Umm, but my fear felt a little different from how you guys are scared of ghosts or older sisters.</p><p>When I’m alone in a dark place――</p><p>It feels like I’m the only person in the world, and I just get increasingly anxious.</p><p>A dark world where I’m all alone isn’t sparkling at all… I don’t like it…&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Are you stupid?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Gami-san, you call me ‘stupid, stupid’ too much! You bully!”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “I call you stupid because you’re stupid. Where are we? The school’s parking space, right? Can’t you see the ‘sparkling’ bikes around you?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;…</p><p>Pfft…! Ahahahaha! You’re right! The wheels and the reflectors are all so shiny☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> &quot;This isn’t some dark world, ya know.</p><p>Me, Adonis, Anzu, and Forehead, we were just a short distance away. And you’re saying you’re alone? What the hell?</p><p>We’re all here because <em>you</em> wanted to look for the fireball, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Yeah. That’s… That’s right, huh?</p><p>I wasn’t alone at all!&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Tch. Fine if you understand. So what do we do? Look for the others?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Ah, wait! My phone’s ringing… it’s Sally!</p><p>Hello, Sally? Are you okay? Yeah. Yup. So Anzu and Occhan are also with you? Ahh, that’s great♪</p><p>I have Gami-san with me, too. Okay, got it! Then we’ll go over there to regroup! Sure. Bye-bye~☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “What did Forehead say?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Sally said they’re all gathered in the garden terrace. We should go back there too!”</p><h2 id="chapter-7"><a href="#chapter-7">¶</a>Chapter 7</h2><p><strong>&gt; Garden Terrace</strong></p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/G26CPOg.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ooi, Subaru! Kouga! Over here♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Sally!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Guh!? Don’t crash into me like a monkey! You almost knocked me over!”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “I’m glad you two are safe.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “You guys look fine too. Well, not that I care.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Subaru, sorry for not answering your call.</p><p>I dropped my phone in the garden terrace, y’see~ Man, that was such screw-up. I only noticed your call when I got it back.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;So that’s why you didn’t pick up, Sally… Anzu seems to have her phone turned off too.</p><p>Ahaha, Anzu’s taking out her phone in a fluster.</p><p>Out of battery? Ah, so that’s why.</p><p>No, you don’t need to apologize. You couldn’t have done anything about it.</p><p>Anyway, what was with you two back there, Sally, Gami-san?</p><p>Just as some loud clanging-rattling sound came from the kitchen, we heard you two scream…</p><p>And saw you ran out of the kitchen in a hurry? I was really surprised.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ah~… Well, about that――”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Aaah! A fireball! Sally, guys, look! There’s a fireball in the garden terrace interior!</p><p>…Huh? But it’s too… small for a fireball? Maybe?&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Nn? (<em>sniff, sniff</em>) This smell is…”</p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/e8g9ZJc.jpg"></p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> &quot;Ohh. Akehoshi, Oogami, so you’ve safely returned.</p><p>You brats gotta cut it out, seriously~</p><p>Don’t play around in the school when it’s night. If someone finds you, I’m the one who’ll get scolded. Mainly by Kunugi-sensei.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh, why is Sagami-chan here?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “So you’re the source of the smoke smell! It stinks like hell!”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> &quot;Ah, sorry sorry. I forgot you’re sensitive to smell, Oogami. Wait a sec ― I keep a pocket ashtray, see.</p><p>Look, I’ve put it out. Doesn’t smell as bad anymore, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;So the fireball was…</p><p>The light of Sagami-chan’s smoke? No way…&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Yep. To give a rundown of what happened in the garden terrace――</p><p>Kouga and I were looking for the fireball in the kitchen, with little results…</p><p>Until suddenly, we saw a silhouette coming in from the backdoor.</p><p>That frightened the life out of me that I knocked over the cooking utensils left on the counter, you see~</p><p>The clattering freaked me out even further that I screamed. And Kouga got caught up in it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Tch, it’s cuz you just screamed outta nowhere. Of course I couldn’t help screaming too, dammit.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “So in the panic, we just scampered out of the kitchen with everything we had.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> &quot;And the silhouette coming in from the backdoor was <em>me</em>.</p><p>I got curious since I heard voices in the school when the lights should be out already~</p><p>And when I came to take a look, I found you guys in the garden terrace.&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Damn. If I was a lil’ bit calmer, I could’ve tell with the smell. You really played me, Forehead.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “I wasn’t trying to play you! But I’ll admit my panic got us into this mess. My bad.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> &quot;Either way, I am glad nothing happened to the two of you, Oogami, Isara.</p><p>Anzu is nodding with me. Nn? Ah, so you also feel bad for getting everyone involved by saying you wanted to see the ghost, Anzu.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I’m the one who first said I wanted to catch the fireball. I’m sorry, guys.”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “You two have nothing to worry about. We’re all safe. And I thought it was fun, searching for the school’s seven mysteries with friends at night.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Looking back on it, yup. And it really <em>did</em> end up being something more ordinary than we thought, after we looked☆”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “The ‘Seven Mysteries of Yumenosaki Academy’, huh…? I’m probably at fault for most of those…”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eeeh, it was you all along, Sagami-chan!? The portrait of Bach growing a long hair too!?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> &quot;That one was~ because I accidentally sprinkled chalk dust on the painting, probably.</p><p>When I took it to the back of the school in secret so I could beat the dust out, a student happened to see me.</p><p>Seemed like the chalk dust made it look like his hair grew out. It became a story of how I exorcised the painting’s ghost behind the school building. Ahaha.&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh~? Do people really make that kind of mistake?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Don’t ask me. It’s not my fault they came up with that story.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Then what about the Anzu ghost sighted in the garden terrace?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “What’s that? Anzu, you were a ghost?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ah no, the capta… Morisawa-senpai said he ran into an Anzu ghost in the garden terrace.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> &quot;Aah, I remember him saying something like that. About seeing Anzu there?</p><p>But I didn’t see her so I can’t say~? You weren’t in the kitchen that time, right Anzu?</p><p>Well, that’s just how it is. You should know after seeing how Isara was like: When people get into a state of panic, they lose the calm to make a sound judgment~</p><p>Morisawa was really scared, so wasn’t he just seeing things?&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “The piano playing on its own and the female student at the rooftop were also you, Sagami-chan?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ahh~ That’s not me… but someone I know. Don’t worry; they’re human.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Bummer… I feel silly after knowing the truth.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “I’m relieved~♪”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Keh! So I was right; ghosts don’t exist!”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “It’s a little unfortunate. If they exist, I was hoping to see them.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> &quot;Anyway. You’re satisfied, right?</p><p>I’ll take the spare key and return it, so out you go. Dismissed, dismissed~&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Let’s go back home, guys. Good night, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Sagami-chan, bye-bye~☆”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “See ya~ Take care on the way home, you kids~”</p><p>(I only started smoking in the garden terrace right before Akehoshi and Oogami came, but…</p><p>I guess I better keep the secret to myself.</p><p>Can’t be fanning their curiosity carelessly, or they might disrupt my peaceful night rest like today♪)</p><h2 id="chapter-8"><a href="#chapter-8">¶</a>Chapter 8</h2><p><strong>&gt; Path to school</strong></p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/UObVf0T.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “So there really was no ghost♪”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “You look happy, Isara.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;The whole day it felt like ten years were subtracted from my lifespan, y’know? Now that I’ve been freed from the scary experience, I’m in bliss~♪</p><p>Ahh, the average everyday is so wonderful♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;To think the mysteries were all on Sagami-chan~ It’s pretty boring to have the truth uncovered.</p><p>The best part of an adventure is really when you have no clue what’s going on, I guess.&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “In any case, while many things did happen, I had a lot of fun. I would even like to go for another test of courage sometime.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Oi, gimme a break~! Let’s forget about tests of courage and play around in peace, like normal!</p><p>Sometime after school, maybe? We can drop by somewhere, go shopping, or go to the karaoke again with these members.&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Yes. I will be looking forward to that.”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Keh! Don’t decide that for me. I’m not going.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Don’t say that~ You’re a member of the Yumenosaki Seven Mysteries Investigation Team too, Kouga♪”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Don’t suddenly conscript me into your weird group! I’m gonna bite you to death!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Then, let’s all have a sleepover today!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “There you go again! I said stop coming up with things on the spot, didn’t I?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;But it’s lonely to just part ways here! I wanna play more and more with you guys!</p><p>A sleepover isn’t scary or dangerous at all! Okay? Okay? I implore you, Sally-sama!&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nope. I’m not gonna bend this time.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Sally’s being a spoilsport! Where did the kind Sally go?</p><p>Ah, are you actually a ghost pretending to be Sally? Give me back my Sally!&quot;</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> &quot;Stop clinging to me, Subaru. You won’t make me nod.</p><p>Look, it’s already late. You need to go home too, Anzu. Should I walk you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Isara, if you’re taking Anzu home, I will come as well.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Really? You’re a help~♪”</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> “Akehoshi. I will definitely free up my schedule, so let’s play again when we both have time. We can have a sleepover too.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Alright then, we’re both going this way. Subaru, Kouga, see you tomorrow! Bye-bye~☆”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Ahh… Sally’s group left… Ugh~…</p><p>Gami-saaaaan!&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “Uwoh!? Akehoshi, don’t leap at me with that much power! What the hell!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You’ll have a sleepover with me, won’t you, Gami-san!?”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “The shit? Why do <em>I</em> have to go along with Akehoshi’s whims!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Recall the bonds we’ve woven, Gami-san~! Aren’t we buddies?♪”</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “And how’s that enough reason!? First off, stop riding on my shoulders! Just go play with Daikichi or something!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> &quot;Of course Daikichi will be with me, but I’ll be even happier if Gami-san and Leon also come♪</p><p>Wolves are nocturnal, right? So you’re still full of energy, right? I’m not gonna let go until you give me the okay! <em>Gyuu~☆</em>&quot;</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> “DAAAAAAH! Akehoshi, you bastard! Don’t mess with me! LET ME GOOOO!”</p><p><img alt="Onibi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/cNok2fQ.jpg"></p>]]></content>

What a weird name! I <em>think</em> I might’ve heard of him before, but–any idea, Hokke?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t call people’s name weird; I agree it has an unsettling ring to it though.</p><p>&lt;Murderer&gt;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>… Mikejima, Madara?</p><p>Didn’t he come up in rumors a lot last year?</p><p>It’s said he’s someone of the same level of talents as the Five Oddballs, or something… Sometimes there’d be a ruckus over him just as everyone’s starting to forget.</p><p>I thought he’s something in the vein of a school ghost story or urban legend, to be honest.</p><p>I had no interest so I don’t know much, but rumors of him that reached my ears were mostly ridiculous in nature.</p><p>Also, this is my vague recollection too, but wasn’t he supposed to have transferred somewhere?</p><p>No, not transfer; made an exchange student for one of Yumenosaki’s sister schools overseas…?</p><p>Sorry that my memories sound faint, Transfer student. I don’t like to remember it, so I tend to put a lid on my memories of last year.</p><p>Well, that aside. What’s wrong with this Mikejima Madara?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Uh-huh… So you met with that Mikejima Madara guy huh, Transfer student? In spring, sometime after you met us… in Yumenosaki Academy?</p><p>And for some reason, the guy keeps insisting he’s your childhood friend?</p><p>Huh… And here I thought we managed to become your first friends in Yumenosaki~</p><p>…Eh? Transfer student, you have no recollection of it either? Just a vague feeling that you <em>might</em> or <em>might not</em> know someone like him?</p><p>So does that mean he might’ve misunderstood?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… and yet for it to be a misunderstanding, this Mikejima seems to know an awful lot about your childhood–is that right, Transfer student?</p><p>It doesn’t sound at all to you like he got the wrong person, misunderstood, or just making stuffs up?</p><p>That sure sounds bizarre. I see, of course you’d be curious if someone like that suddenly showed up before you. Who’s this Mikejima Madara guy, really?</p><p>This is fishy… Transfer student, has he done anything to you?</p><p>No, just the crime of making you uneasy is deserving of a thousand deaths. Your enemy is our enemy.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yep, yep! Let’s go find him and give him a good beating☆”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Excuse me for intervening, but are you all investigating about Mikejima-dono?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hm? Do you know anything, Kanzaki?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Not enough to say with confidence that I do, unfortunately. We merely happen to be acquainted, as we worked together in Wisteria Festival.</p><p>I heard you mouthing some extreme things, but…</p><p>That man appears to be just another student at our school. If there is anything you’d like to know, would it not be better to visit him and ask directly?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “True. Honestly, probing in secret from a distance isn’t very like us.</p><p>Now that it’s decided, let’s go to the third year classroom.</p><p>At around this hour, all classrooms should have just finished class; I think we can catch that Mikejima guy if we make haste.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. Since we’re all the same age here in Trickstar, we don’t get much chance to visit the third year classrooms. I’m nervous~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Where did you learn to be nervous, Akehoshi?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Ah, no–halt, you two.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hm? Don’t stop us, Kanzaki. When we come up with a thought, we immediately put it into action–that’s our style.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “And that is imprudent, I tell you. Look, Transfer student-dono seems hesitant to make you go that far.</p><p>You said it is for her sake, but your good intent would backfire if you end up giving her more trouble.</p><p>It isn’t something <em>I</em> can chide others for, admittedly.</p><p>Anyway. It appears there is no need to visit Mikejima-dono yourselves. Can you hear those footsteps, that sound like they would shake even mountains?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Footsteps…?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/4As0rIp.jpg"></p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! Excuse meeeeee☆</p><p>[Three cheers]! As I thought, you’re still in the classroom, Anzu-san! It’s Mama~ I’m so happy to see you look so lively again today!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Mama…?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Oooh! Are those Akehoshi Subaru-san and Hidaka Hokuto-san over there? Trickstar!</p><p>I’ve heard of your achievemeents! Thanks for caring after my dear little daughteer♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “? Daughter…?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Yup, Anzu-san is my most cherished love in the world…☆</p><p>Can I borrow her for a minute? I have some things to dicuuss!</p><p>It’s a pressing matter, so I’ll be hauling her without waiting for answers! Here we gooo☆</p><p>Now, let’s depart, Anzu-san! Word has it that haste makes waste, but why should that matter when Earth and the universe are in constant haste!</p><p>Wouldn’t that mean ‘standing in place’ and ‘running’ are both the same things in the eend?</p><p>Running fool and standing fool; all fools, so let’s run<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>! [All things are in a state of flux]! Let’s go ‘round and ‘round, Anzu-san!</p><p>Hold hands with Mama for one trip around the earth! Hahahahahaha…☆”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/1r8VRWC.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto</strong> &amp; <strong>Subaru:</strong> “…?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Ah~ <em>Ahem</em>. Gentlemen, I do not believe this is time to stand petrified.</p><p>I have seen this before, so I know… Transfer student-dono was just abducted before your very eyes.</p><p>You should hurry and run after him. Mikejima-dono is a man beyond imagination; there is no telling what he might pull.”</p><hr><h2 id="before-the-dawn">Before the Dawn</h2><h3 id="part-1">Part 1</h3><p><strong>&gt; Corridor</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/cbckJnR.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Stop right there~! Give the transfer student back, <em>Mikejima Madara</em>!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! No one is ever foolish enough to stop when shouted, and only goody-two-shoes obediently give back something when asked!</p><p>That wouldn’t be interesting, would it Trickstar…☆</p><p>I think you guys can understand me, seeing as you’re still children and still so eager to play around! Festival, it’s a festivaaal! Let’s have fun!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Drat it, stop spouting cryptics! Seriously, what’s wrong with you!? What are you planning to do to the transfer student… Mikejima Madara!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! [Out of the question]! Also, I hope you’ll stop calling me Mikejima Madara and just go with the short version ‘Mama’♪</p><p>…Whoopsie? Stop struggling, Anzu-san! It makes you hard to carry!</p><p>Hahaha! You tomboy, what’s wroong? I’m not sure, but are you trying to tell me to not get Trickstar involveed?</p><p>They must be truly precious to you as comraades♪ Splendid, splendid!

Did you take a shortcut?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Hmph… Adonisu-dono once taught me the basics of hunting. It is standard practise to study the pattern of the prey and lie in ambush, instead of pursuing normally.</p><p>Surrender and let yourself be caught, ruffian!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! Anachronistic as everr! I don’t dislike thaat!</p><p>But too naive! You don’t <em>find</em> your path, see–you <em>make</em> it!</p><p>It wouldn’t be interesting to get caught here, so I’ll have you stick with my game a bit longer!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hm?

He jumped! Hey, this is the second floor!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ohh, that man skilfully held onto a tree branch with his empty hand while carrying the transfer student with the other!</p><p>And he just swung down to the ground with no problem whatsoever!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ooh! That’s some really great acrobatics for someone so massive! Alright then, I’ll also…☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Wait a minute. You’ll hurt yourself; let’s just use the stairs and go after him normally.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ehh~? We’ll lose him that way~ Hokke, you coward!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Call me whatever, I can’t get you injured here. I believe the transfer student would agree.</p><p>Just listen to me and stop moping around. We’re going to the first floor! Start running, and fast!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…OK, Hokke. This really isn’t time to argue.</p><p>Let’s get moving! Wait for it, <em>Mikejima Madara</em>~! We’ll definitely get the transfer student back from you!”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “…”</p><p>(…Hmm, those two appear to have decided to continue pursuit with no clear direction, but what of me? Naturally, I intend to rescue Transfer student-dono from this dilemma.</p><p>However, I do not think it smart to let the blood get to my head and join the chase, the way <em>Torikkusutaa</em> do it.</p><p>It would lead to the same conclusion as when I met Mikejima-dono for the first time, right before Wisteria Festival.</p><p>And repeating the same conclusion means there is no growth. Attacking from the rear gate is not to my taste, but… I should go to the student council office and plead for Hasumi-dono’s assistance.</p><p>I can borrow troops from the student council, and Hasumi-dono might know of Mikejima-dono’s goal. Clear the decks, tear down the fort, and strip the enemy bare.</p><p>You cannot win the war by being daredevil. No, simply winning wars will lead us to destruction the same way it led Minamoto-no-Yoshitsune to his. That is what I learned from Wisteria Festival.</p><p>Let us head to the student council office forthwith.)</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “…Uh–hya? Awawa!?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Oh?

Forgive me, I did not mean to surprise you.</p><p>Ah, were you carrying these books? They have been scattered on the floor.

You seemed to be in a hurry anyway, so please prioritize your own goal~♪”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “No, that would be impertinent of me. They are just books; picking them up will not take time.

I don’t personally hold any interest in them, but I’ve been asked by someone to research about this matter…</p><p>I’d love to see that letter if possible.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Hm. That is not a problem, but apparently the content is not of any particular importance. And a large part of the letter got burnt during the air raid…</p><p>Well, just asking my father is of little problem.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ah, then please ask him for me!</p><p>Most records of the Shinsengumi are dramatizations, so I’ve been troubled by the lack of trustworthy materials~</p><p>Well, it’s the exaggerated, made-up image that sells with the fans… so it’s not like there’s any problem, actually.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Hmm… I do not entirely understand, but… I am done picking up the books.

I’m properly cleaning after the mess of DDD–of Trickstar’s revolution–with you like this.</p><p>And anyway. If it’s you Keito, you should know it’s all thanks to me that things could settle with <em>only</em> this much trouble.</p><p>An even more destructive future was possible, and the old me would’ve weighed that choice more.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…So what changed your mind?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “A glimpse to a dream… I’m no different from all the other students in this academy.</p><p>In order to realize that dream, it’s necessary to pick up the pieces, even if it’s too much trouble. Fortunately, at the rate we’re going, I see this ending sooner than expected.</p><p>Isn’t it so thrilling, Keito? Everything will finally begin from now on… definitely.</p><p>Let’s caress and raise it with love: the flower that shouldn’t have bloomed. And then we’ll show it off to the sick and tired masses—</p><p>What idols are like.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I know. That’s the student council’s purpose, and our dream… isn’t it, Eichi?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Your dream and mine differ just slightly, but they’re heading towards the same direction, so I think we can still walk hand-in-hand. Well, let’s both believe that for now.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Excuse me.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Oh. Welcome, Kanzaki-kun… was it? Despite not being part of the student council, you’ve been showing up here almost daily lately.</p><p>You’ve been great help by doing the minute errands for us.</p><p>To wipe off the image that we the student council are tyrants, oppressors… we need to take the troublesome matters into our own hands, without throwing them at those below us.</p><p>But you’re one of Keito’s people, so there’s little problem with slaving you away, right?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Yes. I intend to make my best efforts for Hasumi-dono’s sake. Feel free to ask anything of me; I will do anything, from pouring tea to taking care of documents.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…Eichi. Don’t talk to our Kanzaki. You’ll taint him.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Meanie. I won’t try anything; I just want you to share your toys with me.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Don’t treat human beings like toys.</p><p>…Anyway, Kanzaki. You’re a little later than usual. Did something happen, or did class just happen to go on for longer?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Nothing appears to escape you, Hasumi-dono. Well, you see, it happens that… (<em>explains</em>) …and it is tying all of us in knots.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Hmm? Mikejima… abducted the transfer student? I-Is everything alright?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Wow, sounds super interesting… As tricky as ever, that Mikejima-kun; he never stops being such a troublemaker.</p><p>To do that to one of my dear students–in other words, to steal away my possession like that!</p><p>It’s an unforgivable crime. Keito, let’s form a punitive force. All this time, I’ve thought of Mikejima-kun as an eyesore; there’s no chance like now to catch him and sentence him to a death by boiling♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Don’t start crafting disturbing plans just because you’re bored. You’ve lost interest in the paperwork huh, Eichi?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I mean, isn’t this one of those mundanities that should be abbreviated? A waste of time and little else.</p><p>These are all materials to persuade those people with mold growing for brains–those big-shots who have gotten too old for their own good–to nod their head, right?</p><p>Come modernization and we’ll have machines taking care of these stuffs within the count of seconds. They’re more suitable for the job anyway; as human beings with knowledge, our place is somewhere else.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I think differently. Machines can’t do anything beyond what’s programmed; but creative fields need the ‘waste’ and ‘playing around’ only humans can do.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Hmm… I guess we’re still in a planet of apes. We probably need three more Einsteins to advance the era a step further.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…Ah, sorry. We’ve strayed from the topic, no thanks to Eichi’s interjections.</p><p>Kanzaki. I’ll give you all the personnels you need, so take command and investigate what Mikejima is trying to play at.</p><p>He did cause a similar mess before, so well, the circumstances this time are likely no different.</p><p>But <em>just in case</em>, anyway. Trickstar and the transfer student, they’re currently key people who can turn the academy’s peace upside down.</p><p>We can’t make the mistake of letting Mikejima break them.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “On the other hand, it’ll help a lot if Trickstar would just break Mikejima-kun to pieces, considering how dangerous and ungovernable he is.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I don’t think we can expect that much. Trickstar are practically toddlers still learning how to crawl at this point. Though sure, they’re a very fascinating bomb that might as well has the explosive power to wipe out everything.</p><p>That’s why we need to take extra caution when dealing with them.</p><p>Don’t forget the severe damage we had to take once due to failing to rein Mikejima in.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. When you put it like that, Trickstar and Mikejima-kun are quite similar in type. Bombs, huh…</p><p>But of course we still need to think of a way to utilize them to the fullest, instead of letting them gather dust?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I’m against it. Ultimate weapons cause great damage when actually utilized.</p><p>The smart thing is to find a way to get the effects we want from the weapon, but without actually using it.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Ideals again? You’re always like that, Keito. But well, I guess to pursue one’s ideals as long as it is possible is what it means to be human…</p><p>We still can’t forget a backup plan, though.</p><p>Now why don’t we remove the bombs and landmines one by one, and transform what was once a battleground into a field of flowers?”</p><h3 id="part-3">Part 3</h3><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/C3905Zs.jpg"></p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Please excuse me~♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…Aoba.

Tsumu… Aoba-kun, is Keito slaving you away? Oh no, that’s not good at all; if you don’t like something, you need to speak up about it.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “I don’t dislike it~ I think gathering data like this is pretty fun.</p><p>Keito-kun helps me out sometimes, just for being a former Library Committee member.

Can you explain specifically, what you mean by that?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Of course. Umm, so I’ve been gathering records of the Shinsengumi, like you asked, but surprisingly so much of them are lies and truths blended together.</p><p>With the fabrications practically overrunning the facts, at that.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Well, it’s the Shinsengumi. The Japanese have always loved their tragic fools.</p><p>Though we’re benefitting from the masses’ fondness of underdogs too, so we can’t make fun of it.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Right~ The old <em>fine</em> was sort of like that, after all.</p><p>We embodied, represented the sufferings of the weak who felt they were inferior and abused. That’s how we gathered favor.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Stop chiming in, Eichi, you’re complicating things. <em>I’m</em> talking to Aoba.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “…Tch. Fine, have your way. The third wheel will back off and go pour some tea.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ah, that’s not necessary. I’ll leave once I’m done confirming the direction of the task. I don’t intend to interrupt you two at work.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You’re not interrupting anything. Eichi was willing to work for once, so we’re mostly done here.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Somehow Tsumugi manages to only ever visit at days like these… How ill-timed. I feel once more that I’m not the main character of a story anymore.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. I think it’s main character-like though, the way events are set off even during your normal days.</p><p>And didn’t I say before? Everyone is the main character of their own story.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “From a more global view, the opinion that everyone is a main character is misguided, though.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “As I said, stop butting in, Eichi. Now the talk’s wandered off the point…</p><p>To the subject at hand. So you’re concerned whether to be faithful to facts or not.</p><p>My verdict is that there’s no need to stick to facts. Folklores, hearsays, fictions, exaggerations, fabrications…</p><p>I’ll take anything, so gather all the materials on Shinsengumi that you can find.</p><p>Right now, I know too little. That’s exactly why I need you to gather records for me.</p><p>Whether to go for fictional or realism comes later, <em>after</em> learning about them.</p><p>At least I thought that was the best approach, and I seem to be right…</p><p>How I see it, it seems we’ll inevitably have to go for the fictional portrayal, but that doesn’t mean I don’t need materials that are true-to-life and detailed.</p><p>You need to know the truths to tell untruths, and you need to first understand the foundations to make modifications.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Show-off…</p><p>Why are you researching about the Shinsengumi anyway, Keito? Since it really screams Japanese, is it for Akatsuki’s next show?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “No, it’s for a personal matter. One of the parishioners to our temple – an especially powerful and influential household among them all – requested…</p><p>…that we enliven the region using Shinsengumi as the theme.</p><p>Apparently my parents talked about me being an idol to that parishioner, during a funeral or a meeting…</p><p>‘<em>Then you should be good at this, right?</em>’ said them, and here I am dealing with their presumption.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Huh, calling idols over for a regional development project…? That’s pretty old-fashioned thinking. We’re not at an era of bubble economy anymore.</p><p>An era where numerable super idols shone intensely like the sun and every countryman knew of their names, that’s a thing of the past—</p><p>If this were the old times, calling idols over might have some effect, even if momentary.</p><p>Yes, if this <em>were</em> that era where everyone recognized and loved idols, who possessed the prestige and magnetism of a monotheistic cult god.</p><p>But with the advancement of media, people’s tastes have become split. Now there are so many idols everywhere, more than what you know to do with…</p><p>I don’t think they can expect such a big effect on their economy.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “That’s what put me in a tight spot. Even if I show up and sing, nothing much would happen. I wouldn’t be achieving what they expected from me.</p><p>And as a family running a temple, that will be trouble. It’s a parishioner; I prefer to fulfill their request, anyway I can.</p><p>The temple still has my brother, but that doesn’t change the fact I’m causing my parents and the whole temple troubles by coming down from the mountain to become an idol.</p><p>I want to fulfill my duties, at least. That’s why I’ve been researching about Shinsengumi to come up with a plan.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “That’s just like you, Keito. You pretend to be ruthless, yet you can never seem to abandon anything.</p><p>…If you just wish for it, I can have a little chat with the bigwigs of that area and settle it for you. It’ll be easy, and there won’t be any need to spend money or energy.</p><p>I’m sure they’ll be glad to be served the chance to suck up to Tenshouin Zaibatsu.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “And do you think I wish for that, Eichi?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Nope, not at all. …Ever the devoted monk, Keito.</p><p>…Oops. Sorry for interrupting the talk despite being an unrelated party, you two. I just remembered I have something to attend to, so I’ll be excusing myself.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Stop right there. Aren’t you scheming something, Eichi? Your face tells it all. I’m asking you just <em>don’t</em> stick your neck into this; it’s my problem.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Well, true. But that doesn’t mean the problem is only yours, right?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…?”</p><h3 id="part-4">Part 4</h3><p><strong>&gt; Sports grounds</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/lHncqtg.jpg"></p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “…Mm-hmm.</p><p>Understood.

Say it, Mikejima: ‘<em>I yield</em>’.</p><p>…I didn’t exactly train these arts to use on an amateur, and ‘s not my hobby to bully the weak.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. Weak, huh? How long has it been since someone treated me like a kiid?</p><p>Bravo, bravo! That was brilliant, Kurou-san! You’re far stronger than the rumors make you to beee! I’m in awe!</p><p>That’s why I’d love to have you carry the <em>mikoshi</em> with me…☆”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> (Oh… The match is decided, then. Mikejima-dono’s killing intent has faded.)</p><p>“That was truly brilliant, Kiryuu-dono! Allow me to wipe your sweat; moisture is blight to the body with humans and swords alike!</p><p>Still, how did you and Mikejima-dono end up in a scuffle… Mmu!?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “[Security is mortals’ chiefest enemy]! You’ve turned your back on me, Kurou-san! Just like I was waiting for!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Having your whole body dashed to the floor should hurt like hell… You’re sure made of tough stuff, eh. You could’ve been first class if you had seriously taken up karate…</p><p>But your failing is you don’t commit to anything. Not that I’m one to – say!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Oggho!?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Ohh, I expect no less, Kiryuu-dono! So you anticipated that Mikejima-dono would try to catch you unguarded by pretending to be dead and sneak an ambush!</p><p>To think you would spin around with a roundhouse kick!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. It’s the first I’ve had to use a roundhouse kick in a real fight; it’s more show than effect, after all… C’mon, if you’re still plannin’ to go at it, stand up, Mikejima.</p><p>If you’re a baby who can’t stand on his own feet, I’ll gladly lift you up by the collar♪”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Ohh, you’re just like a tornado, Kurou-saan! Alright, I got it. It’s my loss, my loss! I yield!</p><p>I don’t see benefit in pressing any furtherr! I’ve lost to yoou!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Great. You properly said that you yield. Now I can relax.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Tch~… While being careful not to say I yield, I was trying to catch you off-guard and do a surprise attack, you knoow?</p><p>I thought that would decide the match, but to think you would take me down like noothing?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “That’s how a brawl is; it’s not the end until your opponent has been either rendered completely powerless, or made to admit defeat. Wasn’t that what you wanted, Mikejima? A brawl?</p><p>I kept ya company. So how’s it feel? Satisfied?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Of course! [Thank you for the patronage]! I’m content and full! That was sooo fun. I haven’t had anyone to compete seriously against lately, you seee!</p><p>But if I don’t do it seriously once in a while, I won’t know my limiits!</p><p>And then I might end up causing disasters by brandishing a little too much power towards those not my level!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. Well, an elephant playing around with a little puppy will inevitably end up crushing it underfoot. I get that.</p><p>Anyway, I did put the brakes on, but you’re not hurt anywhere, are ya? I have a first aid kit so I can treat you if you really need it.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! That was putting the brakes oon? The summit of the mountain is a high and faraway place indeed!</p><p>On a path less traveled you’ll find a mountain of flowers<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>! That was such a fulfilling climbb!</p><p>[Exhilarating]! If it’s fine with you, let’s play again… Kurou-san♪”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Nope. I can win this time due to the gap in experience, but give it three more rounds and the winner between us will become hard to predict.</p><p>Meaning I <em>might</em> lose. Be as I am, I have my pride, y’know. I’ll be bummed out for real if I lose at handcrafts or karate, so spare me the thought.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! But that’s exactly why this has meaning! It is by tasting the pain of defeat that men may conquer it and mature! Let’s advance the path of evolution together… Kurou-san!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You sure talk a bunch. Wanna take another punch? Haa?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Scary, scary! Should you really whip the loser furtheer? What was that you said about not wanting to bully the weak? Hahaha! Or will you take back those woords?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You really won’t shut that mouth, will ya… I’m starting to consider stopping your breath once and for all to spare myself from any annoyance down the line.”</p><h3 id="part-6">Part 6</h3><p><strong>&gt; Garden Terrace</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/OBROX1j.jpg"></p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Now, everyone! Kiryuu-dono and I have cooked some treats, so have them as you will!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. Thought there should be something to nibble at between our lil’ chat, but the snacks ended up being more intricate than I meant it… Sorry for the wait, kids.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’ll have some.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh yay! Don’t mind us digging in, then~☆”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! [A good wife and a wise mother]! You really are skillful with your fingers huh, Kurou-san? So you know your stuffs even with making sweets♪”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haa? Some old-school values you live by there.</p><p>At our place, our dad’s too busy with work to cook and stuff, y’see. So I cook my own meal everyday.</p><p>C’mon, go ahead and dig in. They prolly don’t look too pretty, but they’re not inedible.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “The modesty! These are impressive! You continue to surprise me, Kiryuu-dono; you are still way ahead of me in too many fields♪”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You’ll surpass me in no time. It’s the guys who persist on with diligence and honesty who wind up the strongest.</p><p>Anyway, you gotta stop loitering and take a seat, Kanzaki.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Will do, once I am done giving tea to everyone…”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Zaki-saaan, the seat next to me is empty! Sit here, here☆”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Fufu. <em>Torikkusutaa</em>, I see you are keeping Transfer student-dono guarded from both sides.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah, just in case. …So we’ll be fast to move on the guard this time, if Mikejima Madara were to try anything on the transfer student again.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. Kanzaki, I thought you might not fit in class with your quirks… but you’re getting along just fine, shockingly enough. Good, good.</p><p>Anyway, I’ll put our discussion on track since it’s gotten all jumbled; that’s what we’re opening a round table here for.</p><p>Might be inevitable when Mikejima’s involved, but seriously, I’ve had it with being played around.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Oh? I’m offended that you talk like the fault’s all on mee! Hahaha☆”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Stop laughing and learn to show some remorse, you dumbass. Ya think it’s okay to cause a problem for your underclassmen? We make our juniors uneasy when we don’t hold ourselves together as upperclassmen, y’know.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Ow-ow-ouch!? Don’t wristlock me like that! You’re dislocating my joooints! It’s alright, Kurou-san, I feel sorry about it like I should, okaaay…!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Uh. Kiryuu-senpai, so you’re good friends with Mikejima… senpai?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Nah, more than acquaintances but less than friends I’d say. This guy barely comes to school so I dunno much about him, to be honest…</p><p>We did clash quite a few times last year.</p><p>But it ain’t as easy as how it goes in manga. You don’t automatically become friends after fighting.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Right! We don’t know each other that well, but I’ve always had interest in him! So I was thinking to have Kurou-san carry the <em>mikoshi</em> with me this time!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “That carrying the <em>mikoshi</em> stuff I don’t get. Is that an expression? I’m not the witty type, so put it in plain words that I can understand.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! We’re not quite at that stage, yeeet♪</p><p>…Ow-ow-ouch!? Like I said, please spare me the joint locks, Kurou-san!</p><p>It’s not me being unnecessarily cryptic! The specifics really haven’t been decideed!</p><p>I’ve done works by gathering people to form a team with like this, many times before.</p><p>That’s how I work as MaM. I’ve frequently held stuffs like the Wisteria Festival that Souma-san also participated in.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Yes, that was a valuable experience, but…</p><p>Mikejima-dono, do you abduct other students to be forced to join you and cause this kind of ruckus each time?</p><p>Hasumi-dono is distressed, if you must know. Do refrain from adding onto that person’s burdens.</p><p>Rather than recruiting teammates each time a work comes to you, would it not be better to form a unit normally?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. Achieving results without forming a unit shatters the very foundation of the unit system, you see.</p><p>It’s a method those people once called the Five Oddballs had avoided, due to their wish for peace. And that’s my revolution.</p><p>Apparently a certain group have been barking about revolution and all, but in the end they’re just swallowed into the system…</p><p>So only that Switch unit and I are left to present other possibilities.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? Hokke, isn’t he like, picking a fight with us?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Destruction and revolution are two different things. To defy and destroy everything you’ve laid your eyes on is pure violence.</p><p>To transform the mentality of the masses by triumphing over the student council, and aim for a better future together—</p><p>That’s our revolution.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hmm, so you changed them and that’s it? You just leave them bee?</p><p>Becoming a hero comes with duties; and are you guys properly fulfilling yoours? Let’s give it a thought, don’t we!</p><p>You pulled a revolution. You gained the right to change everything. Yet you neglect that right, playing around excitedly without a care…</p><p>Just like the Five Oddballs once did.</p><p>In the end, Eichi-san and Keito-san weren’t excused from their positions, still supplementing for what’s missing behind and on the stage…</p><p>And thanks to that, you’ve had the good luck of the whole thing not falling apart and heading to a good direction.</p><p>But let me ask: What was it that you managed to accomplish? Was it just challenging the student council, and destroying the stronghold they’ve built?</p><p>Not a politician or even a philosopher… A mere bomb like you won’t leave a name in history.</p><p>As you are now, you’ll simply be recorded as such a ‘phenomenon’, an accident…</p><p>And you’ll be forgotten, while the student council who still holds the rights to politics in this land weaves the coming history.</p><p>See? Nothing’s changed. From the outside, whether you guys existed or not wouldn’t matter at aall… Hahaha♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…”</p><h3 id="part-7">Part 7</h3><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/f73Nwbj.jpg"></p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Akehoshi. Hidaka. You too, lil’ miss… Drop the scary face. Mikejima’s just trying to provoke you.</p><p>That’s an understudy of Sakuma for you. Good at taunting and nothing else, eh?</p><p>First, you denounce your opponent, deny everything they’ve done… Once they’re angered and provoked, now you work on guiding their thoughts.</p><p>This is what you’re planning to say next, right… Mikejima?</p><p>‘<em>Help with my work to finally perfect your revolution the way it should be, Trickstar</em>.’ Something along that line?</p><p>It’s a type of negotiation method. Hasumi does it too, though he’s terribly bad at it.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! [A veteran’s wisdom]!</p><p>Things just don’t go my way when an experienced third year’s involveed! This method is really effective against first years who are clueless about the ways of wars though, and most of the second years!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Shut your trap. You poked at people’s weak spot and made children still full of worries anxious. Don’t you dare feel good about it.</p><p>At least restrain yourself, you twit. Man, I just can’t like this.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. I’m a solo uniit. I fight alone, and I’ll play every possible card to win even if I’m on my oown.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Umm…?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! What I said just now were all jokes! Nonsense I spouted as a way of negotiation! A &lt;<em>mama joke</em>&gt;☆</p><p>I didn’t mean any of it – can you think of it that waay?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Joke? I find that hard to believe.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah. It felt really disturbing…”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “It’s my hobby to say disturbing thiings! Though that’s a joke too☆</p><p>To tell the truth, I can’t figure you kids out just from the outsidee…</p><p>It looks to me like you were only swept by the current, led around by the nose, and happened to find victory by luck.</p><p>That’s why I’d like to work together with you once, to grasp your abilities and ideaals. We’ve gotten quite off topic, but this has to do with my current goal tooo.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…And that is?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “A festival. Ah, to speak in your words: a job.</p><p>MaM have built a good reputation after all the works I did. Connections and a fine track record tooo…</p><p>And this time, I’ve been entrusted with a huge job and given the budget to do it.</p><p>But the details haven’t been decided yet, so I thought I should start by gathering comrades.</p><p>I was thinking to invite any kid I could find, anyone; and discuss the details of the job with theem.</p><p>That’s why I picked at Anzu-san and her favorite Trickstar.</p><p>Since I spotted Kurou-san in the middle of our game of tag, I tried to involve him as an afterthought.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I’m an afterthought? Don’t make fool of people too much, Mikejima.</p><p>Ah well, that doesn’t matter. So actually, I had this talk with Kanzaki while we were making snacks… It seems our Hasumi has a case of his own.</p><p>A town revitalization plan using the Shinsengumi or something.</p><p>Mikejima. You have connections and budget, but your job doesn’t have specifics yet and you’re in the middle of gathering teammates.</p><p>And here we have a job with specified details, and at minimum Akatsuki to be the performers.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “…But Hasumi-dono disapproves of us getting involved in this personal matter.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Hey, you’re being distant there. Fussing about the weirdest stuff is his usual bad habit, so we’ve gotta force ourselves in.</p><p>What are we comrades for if we won’t help each other in need?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “O-Of course. Indeed I was thinking to ask your help. Hasumi-dono might not nod to my plea, but Kiryuu-dono should be able to convince him, I thought.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. That guy holds a guilty conscience towards me. He won’t say no if I ask.</p><p>Sure, it doesn’t feel too good since it’s like I’m scaring him into it using his weakness.</p><p>But we’re not doing anything bad here. We just wanna help him since he looks so troubled, right?</p><p>Nothing to feel sorry about. We just gotta be frank and show our sincerity.</p><p>So anyway. Don’t our two problems blend in quite well, Mikejima?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh? What does he mean?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You should understand if you’ve been listening. They can fill in for what each other lacks, and their interests align…</p><p>Discerning that, Kiryuu-senpai is trying to invite Mikejima Madara to collaborate with them.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Heh. Since we’re talking about you here, Mikejima, you should already factor in this possibility, right? Isn’t that why you involved me? Am I wrong?</p><p>You and the strings you pull… You’ve got sharp ears, and like Sakuma, you have wide connections, so info naturally come to you.</p><p>I don’t think Hasumi was trying to hide it anyway, so you’re probably already in the know about his problem.</p><p>…As always, you come up with a bunch of schemes despite looking like a thoughtless fool.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Right, and that’s why I remain unhurt even after the war, huuh…</p><p>It’s only now I realize, that I should’ve dropped all those cunnings and struggled with all my youthful energy back then.</p><p>I’ve missed the opportunity to die… I could’ve done something, and yet I didn’t involve myself in the story. I’ve always regretted that.</p><p>Anyway, there’s no demerit in it for me, so I’m not against teaming up with Akatsuki for this joob.</p><p>But Keito-san wouldn’t like this, would hee?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Even if he starts pouting, I’ll see that I make him say yes.</p><p>He’s a lot smarter than me; he should agree if I explain my reasons.</p><p>First off, he’s good-natured at his core, and he’s weak to pressure.</p><p>Get a crass thug like me to tell him ‘<em>Shut up and obey!</em>’ and no question he’ll nod his head up and down.</p><p>Well, sit tight and expect some good news.

I knew you would react like that, but seriously, the more I hear about it, the better this whole idea sounds.</p><p>The parishioner who tasked you with town revitalization, he’s a bigwig of the region the job Mikejima’s been commissioned with is to be held.</p><p>In other words, if we do the town revitalization with him, we can give benefits to both commissioners and satisfy them.</p><p>This is gonna depend on our fine-tuning too, but we can collaborate as one project without any opposition.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “It bothers me how convenient all of this sounds… is it too crooked to admit this? Geez, I’ve gotten into the habit of suspecting something behind everything.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “That’s not all bad. I mean, saying this to you might be like preaching to the Buddha, but it’s true we don’t only have good people in the world.</p><p>Someone gotta know how to suspect what’s behind the curtains, to stay sharp to the animosity of enemies.</p><p>That’s still too much to expect from our Kanzaki, the Trickstar brats, and the transfer student lil’ miss.</p><p>More like, I hope they don’t have to grow into dirty adults who suspect people’s intent for every little thing.</p><p>Well, I know that’s just my self-indulgence… Some dirty adult’s selfish desire for children to stay pure.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Heh. Aren’t you still at the age to be called a child too, Kiryuu?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Goes for you too, boss.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Umm~ so I’ll interpose even if I have nothing to do with this—</p><p>I think you should accept the offer even if it’s a poor move, if there’s really no other way. It’s a lot preferable to twiddling thumbs without choosing anything.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Hey, you <em>have</em> something to do with this, Aoba. From what I heard, you’ve been gathering materials on the boss’s request.</p><p>You’re sacrificing your precious time despite there not be anything in it for you.</p><p>You’re totally related.

I’ll bend. There are too many things I don’t like about this, but they do say nothing ventured, nothing gained.</p><p>Rather than rejecting everything that comes our way and pretend not to see, maybe we’ll gain better results letting the current carry us and adjust as the situation demands.</p><p>No – honestly, that’s how I prefer it.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “So I thought. Haha. Good, good.</p><p>I talked big to the brats and said to leave it to me, so I’ll have egg on my face if you’d refused.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I can’t refuse your request as a rule. I’ll complain, and I’ll add my touches if the details are lacking. But from what I’ve heard, this sounds like a very ideal plan.</p><p>Darn that Mikejima… He’s probably trying to make us owe him, discerning that we view him antagonistically.

By the way, it’s not just MaM… Hidaka and Akehoshi from Trickstar, and the transfer student lil’ miss are gonna lend their hands too.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Members that have my stomach in knots. Not just MaM, but Trickstar too?</p><p>Eichi will definitely want in if he finds out. Don’t you dare tell him, Aoba.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Eh, why are you saying that to me? I barely talk to him these days…</p><p>And anyway, if it’s Eichi-kun, I think the more you try to hide it the more curious he’ll be.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Of course you have him all figured out. Eichi… I’m bothered how he seems to be doing something out of sight…</p><p>If he joins in on top of those members, there’s really no saving this project.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. That’s up to your skill with the leash, boss.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “So I’ll be at the head? I don’t mind if you guys are fine with it, but I’m not sure if Mikejima and the children will listen to me.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Force them listen to you. You’re the boss of us Akatsuki, right? …Show that you can take command, Leader♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Boy, what a headache… Well, that’s more or less how I wish it though.</p><p>Then we’ll start right away.

Actually, we’ve all come up with some plans for the event together, with the lil’ miss at the lead.</p><p>It’s just a product of our chat heating up and all, so it’s mostly ideas and nothing else.</p><p>Here… the lil’ miss collected it into a proposal, so run your eyes through it.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I can’t believe you’ve had your way that far… What were you planning to do if I’d strongly opposed your idea, Kiryuu?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. We would’ve gone on without you, I guess.</p><p>Trickstar were especially thrilled about this; I bet they’ll carry on as they like if we just leave them be.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Do they realize they have the least to do with this plan? …Geez. How incorrigible.</p><p>Ah well. I’m currently gathering materials with Aoba and compiling them for easier use.</p><p>I’ll integrate these to the proposal you guys wrote, to bring it closer to perfection.</p><p>Let’s gather those members – with their diverging principles and ideals – under one rule, distribute them to fitting positions, and prepare for the future to come.</p><p>It may sound tough, but it’s worth doing.

They had no drive to start with; ain’t no way they’re gonna show up at the Dragon King Battle with its dope rule of free violence.</p><p>I’m not complaining if I don’t have to punch some guy I got nothing for at all, but let’s be honest…</p><p>This is so unfulfilling it creeps me out. What’s the significance of doing this?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You’ll see soon enough. Let’s work on gaining more victories while the DreamFest system isn’t very known; and then by the time the other guys catch on, it’ll have been too late for them.</p><p>In a while, there will be a definite gap between us and them. This allows us to mar the track records of those who may become threat for us in the future, too…</p><p>I expect their failures to be spread and turn fatal eventually.</p><p>The war has begun. But many still have their heads up in the clouds, believing the peaceful everyday will last forever, unchanging.</p><p>We’re making use of this chance to obtain advantages in the game board. That’s what the Dragon King Battles are for: to win as much as possible and create a good track record… make as many achievements as we can.</p><p>This will benefit us greatly in the future.</p><p>Eventually the rest of the guys will realize the true value of the DreamFest system, and we’ll have amassed enormous assets they’ll look to with regret and envy.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Great, well, I don’t have to do much but show up at the stage on time and be declared the winner. It’s just, is this really what an idol does?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Even if your opponent doesn’t show up, or they show up with no drive to win… you’re free to sing and dance like a normal idol, you know?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Couldn’t feel like it. We never did much advertising, so in the first place, nobody actually comes to see the show.</p><p>We’ve got no audience. At our worst, only me and the student council fellas on watch are there.

I just can’t believe it…</p><p>I mean, sure, this is better than dozing off into dusk at the rooftop with nothing to do, but…”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “It will be okay… We’re at the right track so far… is all I can say. I’m worried too.</p><p>No one knows what the future holds, and we’re doing something nobody else ever tried to do.</p><p>We’re bringing a revolution upon Yumenosaki Academy, and we’ll become idols like we dreamed of.</p><p>Both the idols and the audience will share a moment of bliss, bestowing something upon each other, and it will last to the future, forever—</p><p>My goal is one such a brilliant place, as well as its succession and perpetuity. For that, I’ll endure any hardship, eat dirt, anything.</p><p>…I’m starting to feel sorry dragging you into this, though.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Hey, it’s fine. It’s a good way to kill time. Plus, you’ve got some starry-eyed ideals, but I don’t dislike them.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Thanks; I need you. If possible, I hope you’ll continue to lend me your power.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Roger that. What’s next on the list? Another Dragon King Battle?</p><p>We’ve been doing that almost daily these days, so we’ll prolly have no one left to provoke soon.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Not quite true. There are still many pieces we should definitely capture at this point in time.</p><p>We’re especially making little progress closing into Shinkai Kanata’s surroundings. I’d like to gather more advantages before going to conquer that one, but…</p><p>His interpersonal relations are peculiarly slight.</p><p>Apparently he has some relation with that – transfer student? Exchange student? – I’m not sure which Mikejima is… But Mikejima is also unreadable on his own right.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Mikejima? The guy who’s been dropping by the archery range, you mean. The dojo my Karate Club uses is closeby so I’ve seen him time to time…</p><p>You’re in the Archery Club; don’t you know him?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Hmm~ It seems he’s a close friend of Tsukinaga, a reliable member of our club…</p><p>Because of that, we’ve teamed up to take down common enemies, but he’s a man who doesn’t speak about himself.</p><p>Not just that. He rambles on and on about stuffs you can’t ascertain the truth of.</p><p>As I am now, I can’t judge when he speaks the truth and when he isn’t. He’s likely the same type as me, a talkative liar.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I think you’re actually a pretty honest guy.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I try to be as honest as possible when I talk with you. I’m making you go along with my dream; it’s the most sincere thing I can do.</p><p>It’s scary to think what will happen if you find out I lied anyway.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. I won’t punch you in rage or anything. Even a thug knows how to discriminate, y’know?”</p><h3 id="part-2-2">Part 2</h3><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…Anyway. We’ve gotten off-track. Real talk, what’s our next move?</p><p>If you don’t need anything, I’m gonna go train on my own or something.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Ahh, right… I wish we could keep doing Dragon King Battles like we have so far, but our budget is looking tight.</p><p>No audience means no revenue, after all. And we made it so even the losing side receives a reward, as to lessen the opponent’s hesitation when choosing to withdraw.</p><p>We are losing more money and gaining none. I did forecast that, but I’m thrown off that the war funds I prepared are depleting at faster rate than predicted.</p><p>No other choice, then… I hate the idea, but I guess I’ll look into that academy currency system Eichi proposed.</p><p>Basically, it’s a pretty common plan of circulating cryptocurrency as a means of transaction where—”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Ah~… That’s fine, you don’t have to explain. I don’t get that difficult stuff. I’m too dumb for that.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You know, I’ve said this many times before, but aren’t you making an unfairly low assessment of yourself?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/z9LM9ni.jpg"></p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Pardon the intrusion! Hasumi-dono, I have come to receive the entrance test for Akatsuki!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Nn? Huh, aren’t ya Kanzaki… Still haven’t called it quits?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Indeed! A samurai does not betray his own words! I will do whatever it takes to carry out with my decision! To join Akatsuki, that is!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You were a samurai? Now that you mention it, you’ve got some shiny metal stuff holstered by your hip…</p><p>Anyway, it’s slipped my mind, but we’re called Akatsuki?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Give some effort to remember. Well, we’re trying not to draw attention to our name right now so that’s fine, but…</p><p>Later on, all of us will be evaluated not as individuals, but as units.</p><p>In any case, Kanzaki, I have told you many times that Akatsuki is nothing like you imagine. It’s a peculiar unit I formed for my personal interests.</p><p>You should thrive in another unit that suits your strengths; join one or make one…</p><p>I am saying this for your sake, Kanzaki.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “No. A sword may not choose its wielder, but I want to become an idol under you, Hasumi-dono.</p><p>I admit I am saying this based on instinct, so I cannot lay down my justifications the way you do, Hasumi-dono, however—</p><p>I desire to be under Akatsuki’s tutelage. I am very much aware that I am being a nuisance, but I will stop at nothing to make you listen.</p><p>Yet, mere words do nothing to convince, so I shall present you my abilities!</p><p>Now, come! Give me the entry test again!</p><p>And then, were I to know what I lack as a result, I will devote my heart and body to overcome it… I swear!”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Nnh~… I’ve come up with especially difficult tests each time so you’d give up, but…</p><p>You just broke through all of them like they’re nothing, so I have no card left to play, to be honest.</p><p>I’ve been picking on your faults to reject your entry so far, but I’m running out of things to say too.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. Then just fold up, Hasumi.</p><p>I think this guy won’t bend even if you stab his gut. That’s what his eyes say…</p><p>I’ve seen those eyes on idiots who’d get on a bike for a chickie-run no matter who tries to stop ‘em.</p><p>You leave him be and he might crash and burn. Maybe not now, but sooner or later he’ll find another thing to obsess over and crash into something in his craze.</p><p>Then what choice you have but be nice and guide him until he learns how to drive safe, right?</p><p>Hey, this here’s a cute junior taking to someone like you. Watch the remorse hampering your good night’s sleep when you decide to forsake him.</p><p>I dunno you as well as a family yet.</p><p>But I know this much. I know you can’t let go of your compassion… you’re a good guy.</p><p>That’s why I’m helping you. I don’t get that ‘revolution upon Yumenosaki’, or other pretty ideals and dreams you’re spouting, but…</p><p>I choose to be with you because I’ve taken a liking to you.</p><p>This guy… Kanzaki, he’s probably the same. He can be another comrade like we’ve been for each other.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Ohh, you are standing up for me! I appreciate it, umm… Kiryuu-dono, I believe?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Kiryuu Kurou, yeah. Nice to meet ya. I’m vice-commander of Akatsuki.</p><p>Well, it’s only Hasumi and me right now, so if Hasumi’s the top then I’m the only runner-up available.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Hmm. Kiryuu Kurou-dono, is it? A gallant-sounding name. I am called Kanzaki Souma. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Don’t just start deepening your friendship there. …Ah well, I understand your point, Kiryuu.</p><p>I see there’s no other choice. It’s true we are in need of help, and I do want to develop Kanzaki’s talent.</p><p>It will be a bother having to look for him to educate him whenever he pulls something, anyway.</p><p>I guess keeping him nearby will save me the trouble of finding him.</p><p>…I accept your admission, Kanzaki. Welcome to Akatsuki.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Ooh! I am touched beyond words. I thank you for granting my wish♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Don’t start praying to me, I’m not a Buddha statue. …Incorrigible. A strange one has joined our ranks.</p><p>Anyway. I can’t have you complaining to me later, so I’ll warn you firsthand.</p><p>Due to various reasons, idol activity tends to come second to our unit. Forget standing on stage, sometimes it can be difficult just for us to gather for a lesson.</p><p>Again, if you want to thrive as a proper idol, leave and join some other unit. Feel free to resign anytime, Kanzaki.</p><p>Sometimes, our funds also get administered to the student council’s budget and cut up for other matters, so I can’t pay you much.</p><p>I don’t plan to work in the open a lot either, so don’t expect fame in return.</p><p>If these terms sound fine to you, go ahead and do what you want.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Can’t you word it differently…? Well, that you don’t cover it with lies is where you’re sincere, I guess.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Fufu. Understood. Then I shall do what I want.</p><p>I am in your care henceforth, Hasumi-dono, Kiryuu-dono! I swear to endeavor for Akatsuki’s sake until this life runs out!</p><p>Well then, where may I begin? Shall I serve some tea?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Geez, what’s wrong with him… I’m not some virtuous monk; I don’t see why he’s so interested in getting close to me.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha.

My throat is in a good shape. At this rate, I don’t have to worry about the other members taking me lightly during Restoration Live’s joint practice, which commences today.)</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Ah yes, impressive! Hasumi-dono, your singing voice was lovely, as ever♪”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/BOQO7b7.jpg"></p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Uwoh, that startled me!? You were here, Kanzaki!? How did you sneak in here!?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Pardon. You appeared engrossed in your activity, so I hesitated to interrupt.</p><p>I first thought you were reciting the sutra, but it turned out to be a song – I suppose you are fond of singing like we do, Hasumi-dono.</p><p>I too sometimes find myself humming in the middle of doing ikebana or tea ceremonies, activities I should be doing in quiet; which often gains me a scolding from my teacher and parents.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You blunderbuss. Well, there’s nothing wrong with idols liking to sing, so I won’t scold you for it.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “A pity. I actually love being scolded by you, Hasumi-dono♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “What the… Anyway, you’re early, Kanzaki. It’s not time for the meetup yet.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Fufu. We will be staying over in preparation of the Restoration Live for the next few days, yes?</p><p>I came ahead of time, thinking you may need another pair of hand to help with the cooking, cleaning, or other chores.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Ahh, that’ll be a lot of help. Akatsuki, MaM, and then Trickstar and the transfer student on top of that would add up to almost ten people.</p><p>Just preparing the beddings, meal plan, and other stuffs was looking to take up my whole day.</p><p>And you guys are helping with this personal matter of mine out of good will…</p><p>It wouldn’t feel right to demand you to take on that kind of chores, so I was about to do everything myself.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “So I was right to come; my reading was on point.</p><p>As we have said before, do not be so distant, Hasumi-dono. If you’ll have me, then by all means, work me as you need. That is bliss to me – nay, my pride as a samurai.</p><p>To be of service to my esteemed lord and act as his arms and legs is my joy. Do not hold back. Let us split the burdens and shoulder them together… Hasumi-dono.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…You really are a good kid. Ah, not that – I’m glad to have you, Kanzaki.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Think nothing of it. I am indebted to you, Hasumi-dono, and I intend to risk my life to repay you.</p><p>In addition, you kept saying this is a personal matter of yours, but it has become a mission all of us share.</p><p>I wish for you to oversee the state of affairs objectively from the heights, and give us your unerring commands like always.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Fufu. So you’re telling me to order you around like I’m above you.</p><p>Sure. I can’t get rid of the twinge of conscience I’m feeling, but I’ll refresh my mind and try acting like my usual self.</p><p>I’ll reign arrogantly uncaring to the feelings of others, as the Ogre Vice President<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> of the student council.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Ogre, is it? Well, there may be those who estrange you as if you were one. After all, the truth is always hard on the ears, and occasionally shied away from.</p><p>…Oh. Hasumi-dono, you seem to have guests.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Your senses are as sharp as ever. I’ll tend to them; Kanzaki, you go prepare the tea. Feel free to use the teapot and other utensils you see on that shelf.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Understood.

It’s early morning and you’re already so full of energy. I’m tired from climbing the stone steps… Let me sit down and rest for a bit.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ohh, that’s not how a youth should act, Hokke! Don’t be such an old man!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You’re the one too much like a baby. …Well, I guess we even out each other that way.</p><p>That aside. Don’t take off on your own, Akehoshi; that’s your bad habit. We left the ‘other two’ behind… Let’s not rush ahead and wait for them here.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Just admit you wanna rest~ I take Daikichi on walks to temples and shrines, so stone steps don’t tire me out at all, being part of my routine.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “What’s with the noise, you two? We have monks in the middle of discipline here, so keep quiet unless told otherwise. I’m the one who’ll get reprimanded later.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/YGcaqms.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah Hasumi-senpai, thank you for having us.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Morning, vice prez~☆ <em>Toryaaaa</em>!”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…!? What’s with you all of a sudden!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Tch~ He evaded! You had me, vice prez! As I should expect from our fated rival…☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Allow me to explain. Akehoshi recently made it his morning routine to set a record on the least amount of seconds it takes to steal Yuuki’s glasses.</p><p>So I believe he can’t feel at rest unless he touches someone’s glasses in the morning.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “No, and that’s supposed to explain <em>what</em>? You always seem to be having fun, you lot. It’s almost enviable.”</p><h3 id="part-2-3">Part 2</h3><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…Anyway, is it just the two of you?</p><p>I know transfer student is coming in the evening because she has another job to attend to… but what about Isara and Yuuki?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? Did we forget to say?</p><p>Restoration Live conflicted with other jobs scheduled for Ukki and Sally, so they can’t participate for the show on stage!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. Until the very end, we tried every hand to make it work, like reworking their schedules…”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “But it just wouldn’t work out, right? We could take our chances, but then they might not be able to give their best on either job, which would be a problem.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I see. Well, you guys did say Isara and Yuuki’s participation was up in the air.</p><p>That’s fine. All that means is two shares of the rooms prepared will go to waste.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, I think they won’t! We’ve employed two powerful helpers to stand in for Ukki and Sally, you see!</p><p>Look! They’re just about done climbing the stairway!</p><p>Without further ado, let me introduce you!

Does Keito have no concept of inclusive design?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You can go home if you have a problem, Eichi.</p><p>I get Aoba, he helped me out gathering materials to be incorporated into the event plan; but what’s <em>your</em> excuse for showing up like you’re invited…? Incorrigible.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hehe. I told you, they’re both stand-ins for Sally and Ukki! Eichi-senpai for being a student council officer like Sally, and Blue-senpai for being a Glasses Spokesman like Ukki♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. I wonder if I can properly do Isara-kun’s part…♪”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Like I’ve been saying, I’m <em>Aoba</em>, not Blue~ And uh, do you really need a Glasses Spokesman?</p><p>Even on the off-chance you do, wouldn’t Keito-kun be more than enough?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Yup. There’s no pervert who uses ten to twenty pairs of glasses for different purposes like Keito does.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Use the word ‘enthusiast’. I don’t know what you’re scheming, but I won’t let you off easy if I catch you stirring things up, Eichi.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Meanie. Your childhood friend dashed all the way to your rescue and what a sad thing you say to him…</p><p>Oh the tears. Can I light a flame and relive the Golden Pavilion arson<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> here to wash away the sorrow?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Stop getting periodically inspired to set my family’s temple on fire, Eichi. You transgressor, don’t be shocked when you can’t pass in peace.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “So you say, but you’ll be holding my services when I die, won’t you?</p><p>Anyway, you might have a different opinion, but I really see no value in this building except to become lumber…</p><p>Won’t you consider burning the place down and build a convenience store in its place?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Eichi-ku~n. Instead of chattering, can you please raise up here? You’re blocking the way for other passers-by. See, it’s just a little more. Go, go~♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Okay, okay. I don’t understand these people, visiting for prayers at this hour on their day-off.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Actually, we seem to be a common stop for people who jog or take their dogs on walk. There are of course, actual people of faith who came for prayers, though.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Hmm. Well anyway… Just like Subaru-kun has told you, Tsumugi and I are here to fill in for the other half of Trickstar.</p><p>I won’t do bad or get in your way, so use me like you see fit.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…I can see Aoba taking on the role of a stand-in purely out of goodwill, but you’re <em>definitely</em> hiding a thing or two.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Tch, I’m acting mostly out of the good in my heart for once… Keito, you complain when I don’t do my job, but you also stop me when I want to work.</p><p>You just destroyed any motivation I had~ Maybe I should go home for real.</p><p>I thought Keito with his unit alone might have trouble keeping Mikejima-kun and Trickstar under control, so I came to lend a hand, but this is what I get?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hey now, vice prez~! Look what you’ve done; you just made Eichi-senpai sulk! Tell him you’re sorry!”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “When did you two get so friendly…?</p><p>Well, I doubt you had the intention to listen to me in the first place, Eichi. Do what you want, but don’t give help I never asked.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I hear you. …Ahh, I’ve finally raised up here.</p><p>I wonder, the people of old must’ve experienced this same feeling of achievement, along the endorphin rush caused by the heavy exercise… So, did they mistake those for religious ecstasy, and paint an illusion of God in their heads?</p><p>I’d love to hear the opinion of an expert. Tsumugi, what do you think?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Eh? I wouldn’t know.</p><p>I think God might find it hard to bestow you salvation if you try to make sense of Him too much, so perhaps you can try to be more of a fool?</p><p>Anyway, can I go ahead and put my things inside?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Yeah, you do that… You’re bringing a lot, Aoba. The training camp is just for a few nights, you know?</p><p>What manner of things are you… squeezing in there?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “No, you see~ While I was packing, I just felt like, ‘<em>Wouldn’t I need this?</em>’ ‘<em>This one too, just in case!</em>’ at every item I could find, and I ended up stuffing all of them in…</p><p>I’m no good, huh~ being too much of a worrywart.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Yeah, I can lend you most necessities, so it would’ve been fine even if you came with just the clothes you put on. Even if you forget something, you can always go home to retrieve it; it’s not far.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “That’s true~ Fufu, but I’m excited; it’s like having nights out with friends.</p><p>I know I shouldn’t be casually enjoying this since this is all for practice, but still.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Right, I’d like to confirm just in case. You all have the permission of your guardians to stay over, right?</p><p>Especially you, Eichi; you’ll cause a massive fuss if you stay the night without a word.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Don’t worry. I told them I will be in your house’s care for a few days, and they had this reminiscing look on their faces.</p><p>It must’ve taken them back to when we used to stay the night at each other’s house like good friends♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You mean when you came to play uninvited, and when I paid you sick visits and you wouldn’t let go, all which subsequently led to one of us staying the night?</p><p><em>That’s</em> the real version. Don’t modify them to sound like happy memories.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Modify? That’s just what they are to me, you know: simple happy memories.”</p><h3 id="part-3-2">Part 3</h3><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. I’ve heard the story, but you two really are childhood friends, huh?</p><p>It sure sounds nice to have someone like that… I used to move in and out a lot, so I don’t have friends I’ve known for long.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “…You can meet with many people and make friends with them from now on. There should be nothing like early or late in doing that.</p><p>Anyway, the word ‘childhood friends’ reminds me… Is that stuff about Mikejima-kun being childhood friends with Transfer student-chan real?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nn~ Hard to say. She told us she didn’t really remember.</p><p>We were supposed to interrogate Mikejima… -senpai about that, but it’s slipped our minds completely because new unrelated topics kept popping up.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Huh. If Transfer student-chan to Mikejima-kun is an important presence like Keito is to me…</p><p>I thought I could use that relationship to my advantage.</p><p>Like I did when I conquered Shinkai Kanata of the Five Oddballs.</p><p>But does a man like Mikejima-kun <em>truly</em> have something he holds dear?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Hmm. By the way, Mikejima and Kiryuu will use up their morning to do an inspection of Restoration Live’s venue-to-be.</p><p>So they’re likely to show up late… or so they said.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh? Why those two alone? That’s unfair~! Since we’re doing the Restoration Live together, I want all of us to check out the venue together too!”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. <em>Everyone together</em> – that’s just like Trickstar. Children who shine more radiantly than anyone when they’re gathered…</p><p>Can we really fill in for such children?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Trickstar itself is like representative of <em>fine</em>, so we’re representing for our representative— …I guess that doesn’t make sense.</p><p>I think we’ll benefit more from going with the flow this time around, instead of swimming in thoughts.</p><p>Anyway, it <em>is</em> baffling that those two went ahead on their own. I can’t think of a merit for either of them. Why would they do that?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Who knows. Mikejima seems to have taken a liking to Kiryuu, so he might simply want to talk to him without interference.</p><p>Well, actual practice begins in the afternoon, and there should be no problem as long as they show up on time. It’s their freedom to do whatever they want with whoever they want, even if it does pique my curiosity.</p><p>Either way, bring your luggages inside and go get changed.</p><p>Gather at the main hall after that. I want to discuss our schedule for the camp. Eichi should know where the main hall is—right?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Yeah. Ahh, it all really takes me back…♪”</p><p><strong>&gt; Hasumi Residence (Temple’s Main Hall)</strong></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Excuse meee!

I’m lonely!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Look closer, Akehoshi. Kanzaki is in the middle of cleaning his sword.</p><p>If I recall correctly, moisture can make swords rust faster, so during this activity, he stuffs his mouth with tissue paper to prevent saliva from reaching the sword.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/zGN50xU.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, and that’s why he can’t speak.

That’s what I’m feeling!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I get that, but fooling around with an armed man is asking for disasters, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “…Pardon. I have finished attending my sword; I apologize for not speaking until now.</p><p>Since all of you took some time to come, I thought I should take the chance to get my routine over with.</p><p>Now now! I have prepared some tea, so why not have a sip? We have Japanese sweets too. Here, sweet potato youkan♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ohh, I am very much obliged.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You’re getting swept into Kanzaki’s period drama, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…Do you guys just naturally talk like you’re on a comedy skit all the time?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Hasumi-dono. You only showed up for a moment before disappearing for the second time – where have you been?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Sorry, I was carrying the necessary equipments to our lesson room.</p><p>There is this relatively spacious warehouse a little apart from the temple, you see…</p><p>It was made to be soundproof due to certain reasons, so my plan is for us to have our lessons there.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh, what? A <em>soundproof</em> warehouse…? Smells fishy. You’re not keeping someone locked up in there, are you?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “What do you take me for? My parents built that place back when I held interest in music.</p><p>Playing instruments and singing in the premises would disturb the monks’ religious routines… They likely intended to isolate all sources of noise at one place.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Well, to start with, a temple is indeed a place of worship and discipline.</p><p>And because of that, I had been worried that we might cause disturbance by singing here, but that explanation made me understand.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah, same. We’re going to hold lessons here for days, but it was even more of a textbook temple than I imagined. I was worried if it would be okay, too.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I would have never invited you guys if it wasn’t okay. It’s my house, it’s free, so we can have our practice at low cost.</p><p>Mikejima and his commissioner appeared to be willing to share their budget, but I’d like to avoid depending on that man…</p><p>Funds are better spent on stage props and costumes, anyway.</p><p>We are holding a live show on a land related to the Shinsengumi. Winging the job by wearing lousy-made clothes would lack sincerity and invite backlash.</p><p>We’re giving this job all our earnestness and effort… Got it?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. We’re looking to learn from you, vice president.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. Thinking about it, it’s so strange that we’re doing a live show with Akatsuki on the same side…</p><p>Restoration Live! I wonder what the stage will be like?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “That’ll depend on our hard work hereon. And your group is the most fledgling among us; I won’t hesitate to exclude you if I judge that you can’t match our pace.</p><p>Light your fire and plug away, Trickstar.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Of course. We’ll give everyone a good shock like we always have. Right, Akehoshi?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You bet! We’re totally on fire here, so no worries! Wait until we show you the best sparkles you’ll ever see☆”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…You heard them. Of course you don’t plan to lose out, Kanzaki?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Indeed. I am also as much of a fledgling as <em>Torikkusutaa</em>, if not more…</p><p>So I shall also tackle the stage with determination, while looking to the senior members for guidance.</p><p>Ahh, the warrior blood in me is boiling in excitement…♪”</p><h3 id="part-4-2">Part 4</h3><p><strong>&gt; Hasumi Residence (Outside)</strong></p><p>&lt; Evening of the same day &gt;</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Darn, I can’t believe what you dished out on me…”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Loh06pD.jpg"></p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! [Drink like a whale and eat like a horse]! Why don’t we stuff our stomachs full to grow bigger! I’m sure you can grow big enough to hold the Earth on your palm, Kurou-saaan!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Oh shut it. Where does a creature like that exist? That’s a monster you’re thinkin’…</p><p>Hey, you spruce up your words like that so you can steer the topic away while we’re taking in what you said, don’tcha?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Bravo! You’ve seen through all my triicks. This is another technique I learned from watching Rei-san, by the waay!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You pick the worst things to learn… Must be nice to be so slick; I wish I had your gift.</p><p>Anyway, that was no ‘inspection’ there. Working me hard as soon as we got to the venue…</p><p>All that singing dried up my throat. Now I’ve got this raspy voice like the old Nito.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Nito? Nazuna-san, huuh? He’s making welcome steps towards advancement tooo…♪”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Don’t you lay a finger on him, Mikejima. You’ll see the worst of me if you give him more pain and sadness than he already has to live with.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! I would actually love to see your real wrath, Kurou-saan♪”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “I kid, I kid. I’m not <em>that</em> eager to die…</p><p>Life did feel somewhat dreary and unenjoyable before, but these recent days have been pretty exciting.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “That so. Well, don’t cause a ruckus and disturb the people around you just because you’re bored, you clown. You’re not gonna live long if you keep that up, Mikejima.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! The human life is like firework! To bloom and scatter with a blast would be fun on its own right! The end…☆”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I really can’t tell when you’re being serious.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Neither can I! Hahaha! But it’s so nice to be with you, Kurou-san; this feeling of being pushed to my limits makes me happyy♪</p><p>I’m honored to be able to work with you today! Let’s carry the <em>mikoshi</em> together again some time♪”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Yeah, well, I didn’t think you’d make me carry a literal palanquin…</p><p>And not just any but a massive one that usually takes a group to lift. You made me carry that with you to every nook of the town…”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! Wasn’t it fun? Who could’ve guessed we’d come across a festival when inspecting the venue? What a pleasant surprisee!</p><p>These little happenings are what keeps a journey interesting…☆”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Surprise my foot. They left preparing and jazzing up the festival on our hands as soon as we got there.</p><p>Hard to believe you dunno what festival is held on which date. Wasn’t it part of your game, Mr. Festival?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “I wonder? There are as many festivals across the country as there are stars in the sky! Even I can’t keep up with all of theem!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “If it’s you, I bet counting all those stars would be piece of cake.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “You put me on a pedestaal… Well, I won’t deny the possibility.</p><p>Instead of pointing at them one by one, I just have to find the formula to estimate them, riight?</p><p>Okaay, why don’t we start now since the stars are just peeking out! Together, Kurou-san! Oooone! Twoooo! Threee!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Ahh, the stars have really come out…</p><p>The sun’s setting. We’re really behind the schedule. At this rate, we’re gonna have to sit through Hasumi’s sermon until night dawns.</p><p>I’ve texted him via smartphone, but he’s probably worried…</p><p>What if he’s making a shameful show of himself on practice because he’s too preoccupied with how we’re doin’…”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! I think Keito-san would be fine; he’s a child with composuree! He can put aside his emotions to accomplish what he set out to do!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “So you’d think, right? But y’know, he’s surprisingly the emotional type…</p><p>He’s learned various tricks to keep it under control, but the drop in performance makes it obvious when his heart isn’t in it.</p><p>…Wait, is that your aim?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Nn? What is what? Be more specific!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Looking back, all of your actions today would lead to the weakening of Akatsuki.</p><p>You keep me at a distance, which also planted concern in Hasumi’s head, interfering with his judgment and actions…</p><p>With Kanzaki still inexperienced, he’ll be thrown off tune when he notices how odd Hasumi is being.</p><p>Akatsuki would be a mess as a result. And seeing that, the other guys might think, ‘<em>Oh, so Akatsuki’s nothing big</em>’… yeah?</p><p>If worse comes to worst, someone impatient or unimpressed might snatch away Akatsuki’s right of command.</p><p>Restoration Live’s supposed to center on us, but take the wrong step and we might get kicked out of the stage entirely.</p><p>And that’s your aim, Mikejima. You’ve been an oppositionist; you’ll be thrilled when we crumble.”</p><h3 id="part-5-2">Part 5</h3><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Impressive! You’re really the likeliest member of Akasuki to be a thorn in my side, Kurou-saan!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Whoa, I got it right with a wild guess?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Well, your suspicions lack grounds, but you’re not wrong about my intent.</p><p>Just to be clear, thoough… Even <em>I’m</em> not conceited enough to think everything will dance to my tune.</p><p>But, I tend to break everything around me when I’m not careful, you seee. So I stop to think caarefully after each move I make, picturing what my actions will result on.</p><p>And then I take the next step. Slowly, wisely.</p><p>I’ll be honest with you, Kurou-san. Defaming Akatsuki and elevating Trickstar is my current mission.</p><p>I provoke Trickstar, lay a hand on what they treasure, and get them to hate me on purpose, so they won’t catch onto what I’m doing.</p><p>And those children seem to loathe having an outsider get involved in what they do, especially in a controlling mannerr…</p><p>So if they surmise that I’m actually pulling the strings for them, they might oppose instead.</p><p>Hehe. What do you think? I’m surprisingly elaborate and astute, aren’t I?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Well, yeah. You sure that’s not neuroticism you got there?</p><p>Walking through life while glancing about your surroundings fearfully, because you think you’re dirty, dangerous… honestly, it‘s not that I don’t got how that feels.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Right, I chose to be frank with you because I know you can relate.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “But I don’t get it… What’s the point? Even without help, isn’t Trickstar rising up at a nice pace?</p><p>They won DDD and made a revolution happen. At the end of the year, they’ll stand on the stage of SS as Yumenosaki’s rep.</p><p>They rocketed up the stairs at unbelievable speed. If you ask me, stopping them is harder.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Is that how it looks to yoou? All I see is them getting prettily cut up to suit a stereotype and made into a convenient tool of the student council… Eichi-san, especially.</p><p>Their revolution was wonderful! A true miraclee! A flower bloomed on the barren night sky despite all odds! <em>Taamayaa~! Kaagiyaaa~!</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup></p><p>And yet, Trickstar – either appeased or out of fuel – have been progressively withering and dimming since then…</p><p>…while the student council, dealing with the aftermath of the revolution, are rapidly restoring their position of power.</p><p>At this rate, the miraculous revolution will amount to nothing. Perhaps you guys have a different opinion, being the very people involved, but I only see the wheel coming full circlee.</p><p>What a waste. I thought a new arc was waiting beyond our liberation from that dreary harmony.</p><p>In the end, it’s just a prolongation of the story Eichi-san and Keito-san weaved last yeaar.</p><p>I can’t condone their story. The story which scarred the people who had treasured and loved even a man like me.</p><p>I could give my all doing the things I like and those people would accept me without question…</p><p>Better yet, they joined me in the fun; they were the rare few who would do that. But they got hurt, crippled, sapped of any energy to ever play with me again.</p><p>I abhor Keito-san and Eichi-san’s story. Its writers, who penned every twist and turn in it, all the same.</p><p>The saying goes that ‘<em>when you hate a monk, even the sight of his robe will offend you</em>’ …So I deny you, all of you.</p><p>Right now, Trickstar is the only one in any position to censure you.</p><p>They triumphed over you in a fair fight, so naturally, they’ve earned that right. Privilege of the victors, power over your life and death.</p><p>But they did nothing.</p><p>Standing above others should be the chance to make appeals, but they went out of their way to step down from the height and act like part of the crowd.</p><p>Ahh, what a waste! On the final stage of DDD, when I heard the encore that adorned their crowning glory, I seriously burst out laughiing!</p><p>Of course you remember what they said too, Kurou-saan? ‘<em>Let’s all stand besides each other and hold hands as we sing!</em>’…☆</p><p>Ahh, such children, Trickstar! That’s what I thoought!</p><p>Making no demands despite winning, with their own two feet they lowered themselves to the level of their surrounding people, and asked to hold haands!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…Wasn’t that admirable? I was impressed. Not just anyone can do that. Others would’ve gloat over their victory and take all the treasure they could get—</p><p>Saying it’s a privilege of the victors, as you put it. But, those brats weren’t fighting for such selfish desires.</p><p>They’re really just asking to sing with everyone else together.</p><p>That’s why they won, that’s why anyone was moved the cheer them on, and that’s why we think they represent us best.</p><p>If they’re childlike as you say, then we just need to watch over them and guide them to their growth, as their seniors in life.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “That’s also what I’m doing. However, the student council’s method crushes geniuses. Maybe it steadily produces excellent idols, but nails that stick up also get hammered down.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…Because the DreamFest system and the unit system were all coined to keep the Five Oddballs under thumb, yeah.</p><p>I agree it’s a method that chains down special individuals and geniuses…</p><p>But, I think Hasumi and Tenshouin should have already thought ahead.</p><p>They just haven’t got around to renewing the system, probably due to Tenshouin getting hospitalized last semester.</p><p>The Five Oddballs were conquered, and the war ended. With the times changing, Hasumi and Tenshouin are just beginning to write more of the story they discontinued;</p><p>Trickstar’s revolution being the new first page. They’re giving their all into progressing the writing right now.</p><p>Even if, in analogy, they only just dusted their office, gathered all the necessary papers for drafting, and took a seat in front of the desk.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Yes! I thought the same, so I watched, believing. I held back the urge to kick their butt to get them writiing!</p><p>But they never started, so I was getting a little anxioous…</p><p>And all things considered, the sight of Eichi-san and Keito-san naturally assuming the seat of the writer as if nothing happened really makes my skin crawl.</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/TH8Qqnb.jpg"></p><p>Despite the people they’ve hurt. Despite being the same type of rotten wretch as me, with no longer the right to speak of pretty ideals and dreams…</p><p>The ire, the resentment, the jealousy – it all drives me mad.</p><p>Because… Why do they get to do that when I’m holding back?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…”</p><h3 id="part-6-2">Part 6</h3><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Well, that’s why I’d like Akatsuki and <em>fine</em> to step down. I admit, my reason is entirely based on personal feeliings.</p><p>But just think about it. Keito-san and Eichi-san have their hands full with council duties, what’s with the mess caused by the revolution.</p><p>Akatsuki barely gets to be active, that it leaves you and Souma-san with lots of time to spare, right?</p><p>Then you don’t need to force it. No need to work. No need to be idols.</p><p>Withdraw from the stage like graceful losers and pass the leading role to Trickstaar.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/OivPoA3.jpg"></p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…Y’know, you wanna think that way, that’s your freedom. But me, Hasumi, and maybe Tenshouin too – we all want to stay idols.</p><p>Even if you tell us we’re not welcome.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Sure. But idols can’t exist without their fans. You can only rise to the stage when someone sought you, and it’s meaningless to stand there if no one does.</p><p>So I want Akatsuki to fail in the Restoration Live. You’ll keep failing, dropping in popularity, and vanish eventually.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Huh. We got a real snake in the grass here. Wasn’t the plan this time about holding hands like buddies and working together?</p><p>Friends and enemies, taking arms for the sake of the future to come.</p><p>But you, just you – you’re stabbing us in the back and aiming for our fall.</p><p>You took action ahead by goin’ to the venue and helping enliven the festival there, all to secure your position…</p><p>So that you don’t get discredited along us when Restoration Live fails.</p><p>The event would’ve been a success if we had you on command, but Akatsuki flubbed and ruined it for everyone—</p><p>That’s how it’s gonna look. Nah, that’s how <em>you’re</em> planning to make it look.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Yup! On top of that, I plan to make it clear that Trickstar did nothing wrong and worked hard with what they were giveen! All the blame will be pinned only on Akatsuki!</p><p>For that, I meddled with the event plan since its proposal stage, putting on the mask of a friendly big brother as I fed Anzu-san advice…</p><p>Which gave me the leeway to plant several traps fatal to Akatsuki.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “What a scumbag. The lil’ miss is a sincere, nice girl who doesn’t know how to doubt people.</p><p>And you’re set on deceiving her, exploiting her for your own gains?</p><p>Don’t you feel sorry at all? I heard about it, she’s your childhood friend…You think nothing of juggling with her faith in you?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “I don’t want to hear that from the guy who sacrificed Valkyrie and Shuu-san for his revolutioon…</p><p>Plus, I approached Anzu-san with the intent to use her to begin wiith.</p><p>…That’s probably not the right way to put it, thoough.</p><p>What I did was call a girl I haven’t associated with for years my ‘childhood friend’, just because we happened to have played together a little as children—</p><p>By making it sound like we had something special, I concocted the perfect excuse to interfere in her business:</p><p><em>We’re childhood friends. We were so close back in the days.</em></p><p>Under those pretexts, I nurture her into the suitable producer.</p><p>If she gets stronger, Trickstar grow along her. They can kick down the student council and become true protagonists.</p><p>Nah, I will pep those children up and lift up the <em>mikoshi</em> they’re on myself.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “And? How’s that fared you? Whaddya <em>really</em> want, Mikejima?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Something to kill time with, and stress relief, I gueess… As of now, I don’t have any dreams or ideals.</p><p>No one taught me how to find one, and they never let me in such beautiful concepts anymore.</p><p>Even though, as a child, everyone would treat me like one of theem.</p><p>…When she finds out the truth, maybe Anzu-san will hate me.</p><p>We really weren’t close at aall; I’m not surprised she doesn’t remember.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I think that’s nowhere enough to make the transfer student lil’ miss angry… She’s got a big heart, like my ma.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Kurou-san, your mama was…”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Heh, calling her ‘mama’ doesn’t exactly suit her image. Oh yeah, she’s in the temple’s cemetery. How about dropping for a visit with me?</p><p>I can’t feel calm unless I visit there.</p><p>I make it a habit to drop by her grave everytime I’m near the temple, y’see.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…Is it really okay for me to tag aloong?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haah? ‘Course you’re welcome. My ma’s the-more-the-merrier type.</p><p>I can’t bring her an offering, but I’m planning to clean the tomb at least… Come and help me out.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…”</p><h3 id="part-7-2">Part 7</h3><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “C’mon, what are ya standing around for? It’s just right around the corner, so get moving.</p><p>If we make Hasumi wait any longer, I feel he’s gonna start scolding us after each eye contact, and that sounds like a real pain in the neck.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Kurou-san, you’re such a curious guy. I’m sure I just admitted to some really nasty things theere…</p><p>I’m trying to cause Akatsuki’s fall, you knoow?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Well, I <em>had</em> a buncha things to say, but I forgot them while I was too busy listening.</p><p>Not sure I entirely follow, but – why not just do what you want?</p><p>Y’know, you’re too considerate. Like an elephant fretting over stepping on an ant.</p><p>You play up yourself as a villain, but I say you’re a real softie.</p><p><em>Everyone</em> ends up hurting somebody else through life. Being alive comes with being filthy. Mud and dirt drenching your body and not coming off…</p><p>That goes double for us, Akatsuki. We once took on dirty jobs to make <em>fine</em> shine. Even if you tell us we’re a filthy bunch, all I can say is that <em>Yeah, you’re right</em>.</p><p>We got lotsa people hurt. I know some scorn us for that, and that’s a given.</p><p>People like us should be paying for our crimes. Even if someone gives us a beating, I got no rebuttal.</p><p>Despite that – you’re not breaking any rules.</p><p>This is you we’re talking about; if we get under your skin that much, you could’ve make us gone with violence. There are other more callous options too.</p><p>But you’re actually trying to fight us on even grounds. You wanna triumph over someone you detest through assaults and traps, that’s not uncommon.</p><p>All animals do that. We live in a world of dog-eat-dog.</p><p>Deceiving the good with lies, pulling strings from the shadows to carry out a scheme… Actually, they’re things everyone does to some extent.</p><p>That’s just how humans are. You’re as normal as they come, no big deal. You just happen to be a giant with herculean strength, so you step on ants even when acting normal.</p><p>Maybe you feel a pang of guilt. But I just wanna say, we’re not ants here.</p><p>Don’t think you can crush us that easily. Come attack all you want, and see that won’t be enough to make us budge.</p><p>We didn’t last ‘till today by pure luck.</p><p>We still want to stay idols, so we’re not gonna let ourselves get crushed by the likes of you. We’ll fight back, pull out of it, and keep writing our story.</p><p>If that makes your blood boil, then hop on. It’s time to exchange some blows… Clench our hands into fists as we spout lies, like the dirty adults we both are.</p><p>But just one thing: I’m not impressed that you dragged Trickstar and the lil’ miss into this.</p><p>It’s not right to burden the brats with the disputes and selfish problems of grownups.</p><p>If you’re thinking of doing bad to them, know I’ll be there to take you on anytime. That’s my only warning, Mikejima.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…C’mon, stop dawdling. Put your hands together. You’re in front of the dead.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Is this your…?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Yep, my family’s ancestral tomb. Ma’s also in there… I think.</p><p>Hasumi explained it to me many times, but I don’t entirely wrap my head around it. I only understand bits and pieces.</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/vHNatOw.jpg"></p><p>Here’s a rosary. And this is the incense.

With that done, let’s regroup with the other guys.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “That was faast. I wasn’t even done giving my name to your mama, Kurou-san.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Ma’s the type to say the living should make use of every second to the fullest, instead of lingering around the dead.</p><p>But then again, she’s a chatterbox unlike me, so that might’ve been a tad too short.</p><p>Ah well, when I’m dead and join her up there, I’ll humor her like a filial son till she’s sick of it.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “I see. That’s right, the living can do nothing but make the most of their liives…</p><p>I still have a lot to learn. I discover new things when I talk with you, Kurou-san.</p><p>Throwing all my secrets out there refreshed me tooo…</p><p>I hope you’ll lend me an ear every once in a while. Well, I’m probably boring you, though.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Nah. I think I finally got to know you a bit.</p><p>…Thanks for not kidding around in front of my ma, and praying seriously for her happiness in the afterlife.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Of coursee. To me, every mama in the world is my aspiration, somebody I long to be. Even I know how to not disrespect them.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. Right, you’re aiming to be a mama for some reason?</p><p>I tell ya, that’s gonna be a challenge. A mother’s an unrivaled existence, y’see… The way you and I are, we probably can’t come close to their transcendence, even if we spend our entire life trying.”</p><p><strong>&gt; Hasumi Residence (Temple’s Main Hall)</strong></p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Hey, we’re back. Or here. Sorry for the delay.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! We’re hoome!

We’re not letting this injustice slide!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hear, hear! We wanna wear matching robes too!”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Stop your whining! As I have explained over and over, the Restoration Live will portray the Bakumatsu era as whole!</p><p>We’re not making everyone part of the Shinsengumi! That’s unrealistic!”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Shinsengumi wasn’t exactly the leading role during the Bakumatsu anyway. If we look at the big picture, they just ran rampant until they dropped dead, never making name for themselves…</p><p>Well, putting it bluntly – barbarians?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “You’ll anger the fans, Eichi-kun.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Angering them suits me just fine.</p><p>But Keito, I think Trickstar have a point. Our commissioner asked for a town revitalization project with Shinsengumi as the theme, right?</p><p>Then Shinsengumi are the main characters. Of course everyone wants the role.</p><p>Yet you’re giving Trickstar the losing role of anti-shogunate ronins; don’t you think it’s a given they’d have objections?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Don’t feed them ideas, Eichi! Whose side are you on?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I was invited as Isara-kun’s stand-in, so of course I’m with Trickstar♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yaaay! There’s nothing to fear if you’re on our side, Eichi-senpai☆”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Yaaay♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Like I’ve been asking, how did you two get so friendly!? You’re incorrigible!”</p><h3 id="part-8-2">Part 8</h3><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Gentlemen, I understand your concerns, but please lend an ear to Hasumi-dono as well. If we are portraying the Bakumatsu era as whole, then things will end in the anti-shogunate rebels’ victory…</p><p>In a way, would that not make you, <em>Torikkusutaa</em>, the true leading role?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Nice, Kanzaki! You took the words out of my mouth!”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “You mean you were trying to con them into believing that, Keito! Of course, I intervened because I saw that coming☆”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Are you here just to stir things up!? Shut up, Eichi!”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Tp4CrcL.jpg"></p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…Oi, oi. What’s going on here? What’s the ruckus?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Ah, Kiryuu, there you are! You’re very late! What’s your excuse for piddling around?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I messaged you at intervals, didn’t I… By some weird chance, I had to keep Mikejima company.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. Maybe he wasn’t piddling around, but peddling – medicines?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, a Shinsengumi &lt;<em>joke</em>&gt;☆ That’s sooo funny!”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup></p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Haha, it’s so chaotic in heere… But I guess that’s no surprise given the members gathered.</p><p>Nn? What’s wrong, Anzu-saan? Hmm… so you guys were discussing the details of the event plan after practice, until they broke into an argumeent?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ahaha… I think it was my fault.</p><p>I brought a DVD of The Blazing Sword<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> thinking it would be good reference, and when we did a screening after the lesson, that seemed to have turned them all into Shinsengumi fans.</p><p>Now they’re all having a huge split over who gets to be the Shinsengumi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Me, me, I wanna be Shinsengumi! I keep a dog so I think I’ll be a perfect fit! The Shinsengumi often get compared to wolves, and wolves are dogs! Right?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I dare you to say that to Oogami’s face.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I think they were called wolves as an insult.</p><p>But of course, if Akehoshi were to play the Shinsengumi, then I will too. It’s better to make the role consistent between members of the same unit. It prevents existing fans from getting confused.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. I do feel that a blue robe will look lovely on you, Hidaka-kun.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It’ll suit you too since your hair is blue, Aoba-senpai.</p><p>Great, and Aoba-senpai is representing Yuuki, so he’s naturally on our team.</p><p>And, because he’s one of us, that makes us the more suitable to be Shinsengumi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hear, hear! Your unit name is Akatsuki so blue doesn’t suit you! I say you should be true to your roots by wearing some red clothes!”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “What the… First off, did you know that their blue robes were apparently just ceremonial wear, and in reality they mostly wore black to melt into the night?</p><p>That’s written in the documents. Right, Aoba?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Well~ but I think the public recognizes Shinsengumi by those blue robes?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “…If you insist on us wearing red, I believe we just need to slay the anti-shogunate rebels in a single sweep and let their blood drench our garments?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “This kid just said something bloodcurdling with a straight face! Ahaha, boy, what an entertaining debate♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “This is nothing as pretty as a debate! Stop with your selfish whining, rascals! This matter was entrusted to <em>me</em> to begin with, so naturally… <em>we</em> are the center!</p><p>Which makes <em>us</em> the Shinsengumi!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha! [Laughable]! Surely you’re aware it’s no longer your personal matter, Keito-saan?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Nn~ But y’know, I think from like a story angle, we being the Shinsengumi and Trickstar being anti-shogunate rebels <em>does</em> fit the best.</p><p>I mean, since they’re rebelling against authority and causing a revolution?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. That’s a good point. It’s important to play a role that suits your nature.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “I knew I could count on you, Kiryuu! Nice assist! Keep pressing on!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha. What boss, did you take a liking to the Shinsengumi while looking them up? You seem to want that Shinsengumi role an awful lot…</p><p>Then, why don’t ya get on your knees and beg the kids to give it up?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Yeah, yeah! You should prostrate the way Isara-kan does it! I want to see, I want to see! Keito, on his hands and knees! Come on, hurry up! We’re all waiting…☆”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You are <em>definitely</em> getting a kick out of this, Eichi! Shut up already!</p><p>Just you wait, I’ll come up with a hundred or two arguments to blast your ears with until you’re convinced! And I won’t even need to prostrate!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…Hahaha. It sure is peacefuul. Very unlike the presumptions we were making.</p><p>Aren’t you all supposed to be enemiees? The order, and the revolutionaries?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “That’s true. Maybe it’s because our dreams are actually one, Mikejima-kun.</p><p>We all love idols; and wanting to be better idols, we scramble fervidly to bring the happy future even just a slight bit closer…</p><p>We’re facing the same direction, perhaps even brethrens fighting for the same cause.</p><p>It’s not as clean-cut as friends and enemies, good and evil.</p><p>Maybe that’s conversely hard to fathom for you, who observe the turn of events from the outside without ever coming inside the mayhem yourself.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hey, hey, Mikejima… -senpai, what do you think? Give us your objective opinion! Between us and Akatsuki, who should be the Shinsengumi?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…Can I really decide that, Subaru-saan?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You don’t need to decide; we’ll just hear out your input! We only do whatever we want no matter what anyone tells us anyways☆”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/meYwLR3.jpg"></p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hmm… I see. That’s the sort of children you are, huuh? You effortlessly pull what I can’t do. That makes me green with envyy♪”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. At this rate, maybe we should just decide by drawing lots? I think either of you would make for wonderful Shinsengumi anyway♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “No! As a Japanese-style unit, we’re the one who can recreate the original Shinsengumi to a T!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nope! Our reimagining of Shinsengumi will be more sparkly and shiny, like never seen before☆”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. I think there’s nothing to worry whichever way the scales fall…</p><p>But joining in the red oceans<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> is a foolish move, so I’ll nominate myself for the role of the bigwig who orders the Shinsengumi around♪”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Oh, then me too… That sounds the most peaceful.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahhh! If you two choose a different role, it’ll be three-against-two! We’ll be losing! C’mon, you guys are Ukki and Sally’s stand-ins, okay?</p><p>Let’s all be Shinsengumi together~ Okay? Okay?♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> ”Fufu. If in the real history, everyone had been Shinsengumi, maybe war wouldn’t have broken out…</p><p>But, history is interesting because things never go that well♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “That’s it, all this bickering will get us nowhere! Let’s settle this by taking turns putting a Shinsengumi-like show!</p><p>Transfer student, you watch and be the judge!</p><p>I see that you and Trickstar are close, but be careful not to let that affect your judgment, you hear me?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Haha, that’s shooting yourself in the foot, Hasumi. Well, we just have to show a difference in power that anyone can see, right?</p><p>Like we’ve always done so far… That’s Akatsuki, yeah?”</p><hr><h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2><h3 id="part-1-4">Part 1</h3><p><strong>&gt; Restoration Live Stage</strong></p><p>&lt; A week later, day of the Restoration Live &gt;</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oohhh…☆ Awesome! So this is the Restoration Live stage!”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/sMWYxvg.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t bend forward too much. You’ll fall, Akehoshi.</p><p>I’m getting nervous since it’s a larger temple than I anticipated… Buildings of this nature just overwhelm me somehow.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/psdFrzu.jpg"></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. You know, if aliens see, they might spend the next few centuries puzzled. ‘<em>What is this building for?</em>’</p><p>To build an architecture this huge based on pure imagination, just to appease the soul… I suppose that’s what’s so foolish and wonderful about humans.</p><p>Ahh, I finally understand the words I exchanged with Keito a while back. He was right; some things do need ‘waste’ and ‘play’.</p><p>It’s the product of evolution of a race that cannot be satisfied by simply living; something humanity may boast to the entire universe.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? Not fair, Eichi-senpai is wearing the Shinsengumi costume!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Mmu? After further discussion and contest of performances, Akatsuki was made the Shinsengumi, MaM the outlander… leading the Black Ships, and—</p><p>We’re the anti-foreigner, anti-shogunate ronins, aren’t we?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. I found a spare costume for the Shinsengumi side that Transfer student-chan prepared in case of something happening… so I put it on. Does it suit me?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Between yes and no, then probably no? The costume looks authentic and embellished, but it also gives off the impression of being cheap.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah, yeah! Wouldn’t a more regal look suit you better, Eichi-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Do you think so…? I personally want to be closer to the people, though.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/0qUp7kV.jpg"></p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. The ‘Bakufu feudal lord’ role Eichi-kun wanted was rejected because it might be confusing at a glance.</p><p>So we have to choose another costume to wear.</p><p>Well, the program has it that we all sing the same song together anyway.</p><p>We only conduct ourselves slightly differently based on role, so Eichi-kun can probably stay Shinsengumi if he wants.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, Blue-senpai’s wearing the same costume as us! Yaaay, we’re buds~☆”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ahaha. Yaaay…♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. That ‘yaaay’ has been strangely trending among us lately.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. We spent a good amount of time under the same roof, so…</p><p>It’s a given that we take influence from each other. I’m glad too, that I got to understand all of you a lot better.</p><p>Because people start fearing things they don’t understand, you see.</p><p>And as they let their imagination run wild, it will assume a twisted shape, clouding their perception of reality. Like seeing through glasses that don’t fit.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, you’re properly carrying out your duty as our Glasses Spokesman! Way to go, senpai…☆”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Is this all I need to do as a Glasses Spokesman? And I still don’t understand if this position is really needed…?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You there, it’s about time for the show. Keep it together.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/aIKpenO.jpg"></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Wow, speak of glasses and Keito doth appear.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Eichi… Why are you wearing the Shinsengumi costume?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “We’re just finished talking about that. Isn’t it fine? Nothing wrong with us childhood friends wearing matching costumes once in a while♪ You know, I’ve secretly longed for something like this.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “What the heck… Anyway, we’re in one of the numerable exalted temples within the country. Watch your actions, or you’ll see the wrath of the Buddha.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hey hey, if according to the plan, weren’t we supposed to be holding a live at some public hall in town?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. A bus picking me up for a hike to a huge temple up in the mountains wasn’t what I had in mind when I waited at the meeting place.</p><p>That gave me a fright. Make sure to inform us beforehand, at least.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Well, I apologize for that. It was quite sudden, but… the local government decided to lend us this temple out of kindness.</p><p>My parents and my brother apparently spoke to the people of this temple.</p><p>I have no idea why, but my family is being really supportive of us.</p><p>Usually they’d left me to my own devices without a word or a helping hand, saying it’s all part of my training or something.</p><p>What’s gotten into them? Incorrigible.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “It sounds corrigible to me. You know Keito, I spoke to your family for courtesy before I was going to stay over.</p><p>And during the chat, they asked me a lot about your situation, Keito.</p><p>It seems your parents were worried because you’ve been perpetually sighing with a glum look for some time.</p><p>But you were enjoying yourself with the rest of us throughout the Restoration Live training camp, right?</p><p>We had many heated discussions until late to fill up the event details…</p><p>I think your family were relieved to see you that way. Maybe that motivated them to give their overtaxed son a push on the back.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “By giving aid they didn’t need to? …But I guess I can’t say it’s uncalled help. I’ll give them a massage when I’m home.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Right. It wasn’t in good manners to cause a racket inside a temple, so we could’ve gotten a scolding. Let’s be thankful they took it positively.</p><p>I pray that the Restoration Live will end as nicely. Just for today, let us idols show the believers a dream, in place of the Buddhism gods.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…You sure are good at wrapping up a story neatly, Eichi.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I’m the student council president♪</p><p>I was troubled when you pushed that role onto me. But now, I’ll show that I pull off the part more fittingly than how I look in this Shinsengumi costume.”</p><h3 id="part-2-4">Part 2</h3><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Fufu. I’m glad~ Vice prez, you’re awfully sharp to Eichi-senpai, so I was worried… but it turns out you guys do get along super well♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Is that how it looks to you? Well, our relationship is as frank as yours with Hidaka, at least… There’s the saying the more you fight, the better you get along.</p><p>We should spread ideals like that to the world. If all people do is hate and crush one another, there will be no development.</p><p>Be that we collide against each other and tumble, let’s advance forward hand-in-hand for now… Trickstar.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/AjyVeks.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…Sure. I wouldn’t think this way until a while ago, but I can see now that such a future is possible. Right, Hokke?♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah… Just don’t expect us to be too friendly, though. We’re still mostly enemies.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/B4GTOAJ.jpg"></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. Written ‘nemesis’ and read as ‘friends’, is it? I sure hope we can keep up that kind of relationship that all boys covet…♪”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Gentlemen! It took some effort, but they will be done guiding the audience to the venue soon!</p><p>The event will start in a few moments, so let us get ready until then!”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/g0yH2RG.jpg"></p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Ah… I was wondering why I haven’t seen you. Where have you been, Kanzaki?”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Pardon. I was aiding Kiryuu-dono in taking care of a different matter – but a horde of foreign tourists then crowded me upon sight.</p><p>They insisted to take my picture, so dealing with them proved to be effortful… As <em>aidoru</em>, we cannot have our pictures taken without permission.</p><p>If Adonisu-dono were here, he would be able to explain it in English to them… but I myself do not know the foreign tongue that well.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. It must be because that costume suits you over anyone, Zaki-san! You’re like the ideal samurai! Yo, Number One in Japan…☆</p><p>I wanna take pictures with you too! Can I, vice prez?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Well, you’re a related party… I don’t mind if the pictures were for your personal keep. But there <em>will</em> be a session for pictures later, in case you’re not aware?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hm, we’ll take pictures to be used on the advertisements, right?</p><p>I see television crew too… This is looking to be a bigger job than I thought.</p><p>Cameras everywhere; Yuuki would have blacked out by now.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Yes, it is a tourism spot, after all. Hence, I believe most of the guests do not understand <em>aidoru</em> too well, nor hold any interest in us.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Zaki-san, a smile please! Smile! &lt;Pea~ce&gt;☆”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Pi… <em>Pii~su</em>…?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No need to feel obliged to humor Akehoshi’s every whim, Kanzaki.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. Are you jealous because Kanzaki-kun took Subaru-kun away from you… Hokuto?♪ Then in retaliation, <em>we</em> should take a picture together! &lt;Peace, peace&gt;☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…You’ve been behaving quite off-the-wall this time, student council president. I don’t know how to react because you’re straying too far from the impression I held of you.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “That’s because I’m partially on my off mode. While on this job, I’m just a helper, unrelated to <em>fine</em>…</p><p>Though of course, I’ll see the stage through perfectly, as Yumenosaki Academy’s top idol.</p><p>But I’m putting my status and other such constraints to the side, standing here as another high school student making the most out of his youth like you guys are—</p><p>As simply a boy named Tenshouin Eichi.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Right, you remind me at ‘helper’. What is Mikejima up to? I get anxious when I don’t have him on sight…</p><p>That man was making disturbing moves throughout the preparation…”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Oh, so you didn’t <em>not</em> notice. He planted landmines all over the place… It’s almost a miracle we can arrive at the day of the event in peace.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh? What mines? What does that mean?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “You need to grow up a little more, Subaru-kun. That might be where you’re endearing and precious, but I’m concerned about the burden you’ll place on Hokuto.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I think resolving problems is pretty fun. I like puzzles. So don’t worry about it and just live true to yourself… Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Uh-huh? Sure… I don’t really get it, but OK☆ I’m great at living true to myself♪”</p><h3 id="part-3-3">Part 3</h3><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “We have strayed from the topic. If it is Mikejima-dono you seek, he is guiding the guests with Kiryuu-dono… Shall I call for him?”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Hmm. No need for that. Speak of the devil, there he is.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Ooooi! How are yoooouuuu!? Mama is heeeereeee…☆”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Y4ZybX6.jpg"></p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Shut up, Mikejima. You’re blasting off my ears with your yelling…</p><p>Sorry for going off on my own, Hasumi. I was dealing with some troubles with Mikejima.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Troubles? W-What troubles?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Yes! Our stage got moved to this temple high up on the mountain, right?</p><p>Some of our guests such as the elderly with weak legs were having trouble reaching this place, so we arranged a transportation service to and from the mountaain!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Yeah, yeah. At first we piggybacked them ourselves, but that’s gonna leave us too tired for the stage so…</p><p>In the end, Mikejima negotiated with the local youths to do that in our place.</p><p>(<em>whispers</em>) …Did you foresee something like this? Was that why you kept going for an ‘inspection’ to the location since the week before?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “(<em>whispers</em>) Hahaha. What do you think? It’s my principle to use every possible card up my sleeeve.</p><p>(<em>whispers</em>) The locals and I are close. Most of the people involved in the stage and gathered here have my back.</p><p>(<em>whispers</em>) It’s to steal the audience away from you guys. See? Aren’t I elaborate?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “(<em>whispers</em>) You’re something, honestly. I’m impressed.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “Huh… Well, I guess that’s necessary. You seem awfully friendly with the locals, Mikejima.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Yep! I’ve helped out with their festivals quite a few times, so they took on the task of guiding the guests with pleasuree!</p><p>I arranged stalls to be set up as well, so the whole town is in a festival mood!</p><p>What a happy siight! Now there’s no mistake that the Restoration Live will be full of life, Keito-saan♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “…That’s a help. We’ve been in your care this time, Mikejima. Let me say my thanks.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “You’re welcome♪ But I’m happy just being able to do a festival, so don’t worry about thanking me!</p><p>Let’s all do our best together todaay! Hip hip hurray♪”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “The cheek… Fine, it’s true you’ve been a huge help, anyway.</p><p>I am grateful to the rest of you, as well. Thanks to your cooperation, this is looking to be a more radiant stage than I can usually come up with.</p><p>Even had I done my best, if I only had my own power to rely on, I probably couldn’t set up a festival as animated as today.</p><p>Our commissioners are likely satisfied, and I believe this will be a meaningful experience for all of us.</p><p>Let’s make our best efforts today.</p><p>And surely, we’ll be rewarded. Not with material profit, because with the event becoming bigger in scale, our earning may be chicken feed or more loss. But we will be rewarded with the sight of the audience’s smiles.</p><p>Just that is enough drive to keep living.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “For Keito, maybe. Anyway, Akatsuki ends up having to use a lot of their savings, which probably cut your activity funds a great deal… Will you guys be okay?</p><p>Since we’ve made Akatsuki take on an arduous position all this time, fine won’t mind forming a partnership to back you up financially, if you want.”</p><p><strong>Keito:</strong> “You’re the last person I’ll be in the care of. And no need to feel guilty; I was only doing what I wanted.</p><p>This is all part of my path to asceticism. Humans grow stronger by overcoming trials.</p><p>Although I feel sorry to make Kiryuu and Kanzaki go along with me.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Too late for that. How many times do you plan to make us say, you’re too distant… If I hated where I stood, I would’ve took off on you long time ago.”</p><p><strong>Souma:</strong> “Fufu. Fleeing from an enemy before you opposes the way of the samurai, Kiryuu-dono.</p><p>Well, such jokes to the side… I would be most pleased to fight under your command forever, Hasumi-dono.</p><p>The value of a blade lies in its lord. You present an even wonderful version of myself to the world.</p><p>That delights me, for it is the ideal way of life I wanted.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. What an illustrative loyalty! Those Shinsengumi robes suit you all so nicelyy♪”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Well yeah, since <em>I</em> gave all my life to sewing these to suit us.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…Were all the costumes made by you, Kurou-saan?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Nope? Prep period was short, and we kept arguing over the content of the program and role divisions, that everything got pushed to the last minutes…</p><p>The anti-shogunate ronin costumes that Trickstar and Aoba are wearing were sewn by the lil’ miss.</p><p>And – that Black Ships costume you’re wearing, too. She made it from scratch, with so much care, starting with the design.</p><p>You gotta thank her later… That costume is really intricate.</p><p>She had to pull all-nighters, and I guess the exhaustion got to her, which is why she’s taking a nap right now.</p><p>I’d feel bad letting her miss your costume debut. It’s almost time for the show, so go wake her up.</p><p>See? She’s sleeping over there at the main hall. Look at her, laying down like in the portrait of nirvana<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup>…</p><p>Somehow, that suits her. That one little miss has a heart as pure as the Buddha.”</p><h3 id="part-4-3">Part 4</h3><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Speaking of, the lil’ miss asked me to pass on a message to you… Mikejima, she said she’s sorry for not remembering you.</p><p>Well, knowing the real story, what came to my mind was ‘<em>Of course you wouldn’t!</em>’</p><p>But she seems to really let the guilt get to her. Even throughout our joint lessons, she’d ask around about you, from Trickstar and the rest of us.</p><p>Trying to get to know you, to see if she can remember even if just a bit.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/jaTRGxr.jpg"></p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “But she told me. Although she couldn’t dig up the memories, she’s really grateful to you.</p><p>You helped with her producer work a lot and gave her advice, right?</p><p>So maybe it was the same when you guys were children. Maybe you took care of her the same way…</p><p>So she thought she should thank you somehow. That’s why this time, she did her best to tailor an outfit like that just for you.</p><p>Said she’d be happy if you like it,</p><p>And that she hopes you’ll continue to let her depend on you sometimes…</p><p>In return, she’ll give her all to producing MaM, she said.

That’s unforgivable, Kiryuu! Not long ago you told us we’ll be together forever, and now <em>this</em>!?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “When did I say together forever!? Cool it, boss!

Trickstar vs Eden, Live Debate☆Till Morning…!”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “<em>Behold! For this is the idols’ front lines…!</em></p><p>…Nn? Wait. We’re doing this until morning?</p><p>…I didn’t hear about that. Ibara, did you properly prepare the script?</p><p>…I’m worried that I won’t be able to stay in-character until morning without a script.</p><p>…There’s been an overhaul to my character since Autumn Live too, and I haven’t fully adapted yet.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Whoops! Your Excellency, lower your voice when you say such things, please!</p><p>Excuse me~ Can the editing team do this to that part just now?♪ (<em>makes a cutting motion with his hand</em>)”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “They’re already encountering recording problems. Is Eden doing fine…?</p><p>No, maybe it’s all their calculated act? If so, they are very fearsome.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Sometimes, I also get scared thinking all that comedic airheadedness might be your calculated act, Hidaka-kun… Honestly, I think you’re a genius.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “? Thank you. I’m happy you complimented me.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hey, hey! Since we’re just getting started, how about we throw out that one just now and record from the start again?</p><p>Oh, but this was live, wasn’t it?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “We do pretend it’s live debate, but it shouldn’t actually be live~</p><p>Our agency doesn’t allow that, so they wouldn’t have accepted the job.”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/hyI7146.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Well, we’re high school students with unstable output.</p><p>The agency prefers to be excessively cautious and avoid the occurrence of unpredictable situations when they can.</p><p>And, as a matter of fact, we would catch a cold, debating in these cold winds until morning! A foul weather!</p><p>It feels like we might freeze over! It’s right before SS, so I’d prefer to not hurt my throat.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. It’s midwinter, so it’s still cold even with a heater. …Honestly, why the rooftop of all places?”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I do enjoy the nice view, though.</p><p>…Ah. Look, look; there’s greenery budding amidst the snow.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Ooh, then spring might be coming in no time! Where is this bud you speak of? I’d like to see it as well! I’d like to share the same sights as His Excellency…☆</p><p>Aah, might it be…? Is it next to that stone pillar, rumored to be a memorial for those lost to suicide? Mr. Cameraman, zoom to that side if you please!”</p><p><strong>Announce:</strong> &lt;First question.</p><p>Why did you all choose to become idols?&gt;</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Did you just ignore the flow of our conversation to get on with the program, Anzu-san!? As always, you can’t seem to take a hint! Aah, I meant it in a good way!</p><p>But really, it is a relief to see that you are back on your feet already♪</p><p>I heard that you got hospitalized for some time!</p><p>I was <em>really</em> worried for you, Anzu-san. I even thought you might be buried under that stone pillar by the next time we meet! Ahahaha☆”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Ibara, that was a little too blunt.</p><p>Pin it down. We’re at my alma mater, so I don’t want to cause too much racket.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Eh~ That was still a light jab, though? But as you wish, Your Excellency!</p><p>The ones recording are Yumenosaki Academy staffs, so even if I poke at their bad sides, they will just cut my lines, anyway.</p><p>Tch~ We should’ve gotten our staffs to come, too.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Hmph… Sweeping troubles under rugs; guess that part hasn’t changed from the past.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Oh? What might you mean, Jun? Let us hear more…☆”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I agree with Nagisa-kun~ You’re being too aggressive from the get-go.</p><p>Yumenosaki Academy is the organizer of SS, so there’s nothing to gain from dropping our good image in front of them before the event.</p><p>Be a good boy. Plus, I find Anzu-chan’s question interesting.</p><p>Why did you become idols… Trickstar?</p><p>Well, I can somewhat guess Hokuto-kun and Subaru-kun’s motives.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Aah, as could be guessed from Akehoshi-san’s name… he <em>is</em> the son of ‘that Akehoshi’, yes?</p><p>Did you become an idol because you admired your father, that kind of thing?</p><p>Then you would be an idol for the same reason Jun is one♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Huh? I guess, yeah… but if Akehoshi-san and his dad’s the moon, then we’re just softshell turtles here~…”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Yes, for Jun’s father was a miserable idol toyed around by the entertainment world only to be consigned to oblivion!</p><p>I believe there is an interesting story to be found if we dig deeper there as well…☆”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…You keep saying things unfit for broadcast. Ibara, I think you should stay quiet for a bit.</p><p>…The show can’t happen if they have to keep cutting our lines.</p><p>…And we shouldn’t reveal all the cards up our sleeves at this kind of place.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Hmm, but I think <em>that</em>’s the Yumenosaki side’s aim, am I right?</p><p>It’s to make us bare all our plans naked under the pretense of a press conference, isn’t it?</p><p>Then I thought, well, isn’t it better to pretend we’re fooled and confuse them with false info?♪ It’s a basic tactic in battles of information!</p><p>We came here for war, after all!</p><p>We’re done with the war declarations ages ago, so wouldn’t it be hypocritical of them to expect a handshake and fake being friends now?”</p><h3 id="2">/ 2</h3><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/qaYF3dr.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> (It’s amazing.</p><p>Eden’s really used to this.</p><p>Yumenosaki Academy sells concert-based artists, but Shuuetsu and Reimei… they’re performing a wide variety of jobs.</p><p>They must be used to appearing at TV shows too. Before we know it, Eden are the only ones keeping the conversation going. They’re controlling the mood of the place.</p><p>We’ve recently started pursuing TV exposure too, but I can’t deny it’s all superficial experience…</p><p>It’ll be hard to bury the gap between our experience and skills.</p><p>Well, SS is a concert, so we can still make the best out of our good points there.</p><p>But when it comes to overall capacity as idols, they might be winning.</p><p>No. I can’t be getting cold feet; we’ve built up a lot for the sake of victory.</p><p>It’s thanks to the support of the surrounding people, to the pushes they gave on our backs, that we’ve come this far.</p><p>So we can’t act unseemly under their watch.)</p><p>“…Fufu. Since it says ‘Live Debate’, I thought we might have to get into serious arguments…</p><p>But is it basically a normal press conference?</p><p>So we should just answer your questions one by one, Anzu-chan?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Huh, Trickstar wasn’t told about it beforehand?</p><p>Doing things on impromptu again… Sometimes I’m surprised at how you can take things in a stride.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. True that we’re more about going with the flow than making perfect preparations,</p><p>But that doesn’t mean we take it in a stride, y’know?</p><p>If you’d allow an excuse, we were participating in a big event called Starfes until late just yesterday, and we had our minds full with it…</p><p>Honestly, we forgot all about SS.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah yeah! All that stuff about SS and Eden just flew out of my head! I was just too focused on what’s in front of me! Ahaha☆”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Oh-hoh? So we’re second to third place in your priority list?</p><p>You sure can talk big now, Trickstar, for a unit that faced total defeat at our hands in Summer Live and left in tears…♪”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/mlfQY3Y.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Sorry. Akehoshi’s wording might have caused misunderstandings, but we do not intend to demean Eden.</p><p>We always give everything the best we have; we’ll also never underestimate you guys.</p><p>We see you as our greatest opponent for SS, so we’ll fight with our lives on the line and absolutely take you down.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “My my, everyone’s saying such violent things these days.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Nothing will be born from strife.</p><p>…Yet this world is a hell. We were created to consume meat dripping in blood.</p><p>…You asked why I became an idol, Anzu-san.</p><p>…There’s a fitting ‘motive’ and ‘reason’ finely written down in the script Ibara gave me.</p><p>…But I’ll give my real answer.</p><p>…Only a handful of people are allowed to live on without fighting and eating at one another.</p><p>…Before, I thought it would be nice if everyone could live like that.</p><p>…That’s why I helped with Eichi-kun’s revolution.</p><p>…But in the end, nothing changed beyond the bloodshed and the chain of hatred.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “…I don’t believe <em>nothing</em> changed, Nagisa-kun?”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I understand wanting to think so, Hiyori-kun.</p><p>…But in the end, those who are not god cannot change the nature of humans.</p><p>…All we can do is to not involve ourselves in <em>that</em> until our deaths.</p><p>…In other words, become the privileged handful who do not have to fight. To be so powerful and transcendent, no one would think of challenging us.</p><p>…To spend our days in the monastery, speaking with the gods, without getting involved in worldly matters.</p><p>…To appear in the world sometimes only to aid the poor, declare the truths, and reward them with a moment of smile.</p><p>…In this modern day Japan we’re born into, being an idol would be the best way to perform that ideal lifestyle.</p><p>…That’s why I became an idol.</p><p>…Also, because Father wished me to be one.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “What kind of person was your father, Nagisa-san?”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/tLjHCtr.jpg"></p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…He resembled yours, Subaru-kun.</p><p>…Their souls were like twins. Or perhaps parent and child.</p><p>…But the trickery of fate led them to opposite conclusions.</p><p>…I wonder if you’ll come to the same fate as your father?”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/HNO64U7.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “This isn’t about my dad.</p><p>At first, it was really because I admired him. He was the most sparkling thing in the world, like a star in the starry sky, and I reached out my hand, wanting to touch him.</p><p>I thought it might reach, if I could become just like him. I wanted to touch him, hug him, feel his warmth. Because I loved my dad so much.</p><p>But that’s not everything to it now.</p><p>I met countless lights in this Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>Losing my sun for eternity, I was so close to freezing in the darkness… but before I knew it, there were warm stars around me.</p><p>Reflecting off their lights, I started to shine on my own too… As that process repeats, we’re all shining brighter and brighter.</p><p>I was so thrilled, so happy, that I became enamored.</p><p>That’s all. So it’s really not such a big reason.</p><p>But right now, I want to become an idol more than ever. I want to stay like this forever… That’s all to it, really.</p><p>Got a problem?”</p><h2 id="effort">Effort</h2><p>Title note<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="1-2">/ 1</h3><p><strong>&gt;Shopping Mall 1st Floor</strong></p><p>[A few days before SS]</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Y-u-u-k-u-n?

I can feel your resolution~ I think I understand how Naru-kun feels now… Boys who work hard really are treasures of the world♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Mmn~… SS is the decisive game we can’t mess up on, so I try to make every preparation I can cover.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “As you should. You’re pushing us to the side to participate in it, so we can’t have you messing up due to the dumbest reasons…</p><p>Go show off your beauty to the whole world, Yuu-kun♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “You’re about the only one who’d describe me as ‘beautiful’ now, Izumi-san…</p><p>I’m usually being sold as the relatable, plain one in Trickstar after all.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Ah, that’s why you keep wearing these unfashionable glasses? You should just show them your unadorned face~… I think that’s pretty necessary, from a business perspective.</p><p>Isn’t it a waste to not use a weapon, when you have it? …Well, not that I mind, if that’s what Yuu-kun wants.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah. We’re idols; the audience didn’t come to see us just because we’re pretty.</p><p>We’re not doing a museum or a jewelry store here~ I want them to see me more in my entirety.</p><p>It feels lonely if I get attention for being pretty, like my face is all they care about.

And Yuu-kun is going to wander around shopping as a breather, right?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Right. And somehow, Izumi-san is tagging along my plans like it’s the most natural thing.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Well, I have nothing to do. Yumenosaki’s crazily busy with preparation on this one week before SS.</p><p>Since we can’t hold any official DreamFests, most units are on break.</p><p>Honestly, since we’re talking about Trickstar here…</p><p>I thought you guys would be training like idiots until just the day before, and be dog-tired on the real deal.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah, things might really turn out like that if left be, so we’re given break on producer orders. We won’t get better by tiring ourselves out before the event, as a matter of fact.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Hmm… <em>Producer orders</em>, talk about stuck up. Anzu’s the one I’m most worried about for potentially working too hard until the last second, though?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. Izumi-san, maybe you actually know Anzu-chan far better than I do.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Well, Knights has been in her care too, time to time… But I guess even Anzu would learn her lesson after collapsing once.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hmm~ But from the conversation, she seems to think it’s fine if she passes out, but that it’ll be a big deal if it’s us…</p><p>So she’s setting an example by showing that she’s resting.</p><p>She’s been taking a breather by meeting up with old friends and spending time with her family these last few days, apparently.</p><p>She doesn’t seem too content, though~ That girl’s a hard worker at her core.</p><p>But really, none of us wants that to happen a second time… for any of us to collapse like that.</p><p>Maybe we should be putting our lives on the line, and go forward even if we lose someone along the way.</p><p>Maybe we can’t win without doing that. But I think even if we win in that case, we’ll drag out the regret forever.”</p><h3 id="2-2">/ 2</h3><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Life doesn’t end with SS. I want to keep going on as an idol, so I absolutely don’t want to do something I’ll regret.</p><p>Izumi-san, do you think I’m naive? You seem to want me to go back to modeling, so me being an idol forever would trouble you, wouldn’t it?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Well, truth to be told, I have complicated feelings. But it’s fine, I guess~… Not like there’s no chance of Yuu-kun having more talent as an idol than as a model, yeah?</p><p>I’ll believe in that chance. That counts into the act of loving, I think♪”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Ahaha.

What are you doing?”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “I’m accompanying Maa-kun. Or babysitting him?</p><p>Apparently Maa-kun made a promise with your… Yuu-kun over there? So I’m tagging along him, since I have nothing else to do.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Ah, then same as me?</p><p>I guess we really come to resemble each other by always working together as a unit. When free, breaks are best spent with family…♪”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Maa-kun and I are family, but isn’t it different in your case, Secchan? Don’t lump us together~ You’re soiling my love!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> (…True. These two are similar in their word choices and actions.)</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Did you just think something irritating, Yuu-kun?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No, nothing really. Anyway, Saku… Ritsu-kun, did you come together with Isara-kun? I don’t see Isara-kun around.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Oh, Maa-kun’s sleeping on my back~♪”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/tHXtVJ6.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Zzz… Zzz…♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Whoa, you’re right. W-What’s wrong with Isara-kun? Why is he sleeping?”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “You know, despite saying that he’s on a break, Maa-kun just kept trying to work.</p><p>Like ‘I’m more relaxed when I’m busy!’ and ‘Working is resting to me!’</p><p>What he’s saying doesn’t make the slightest sense, so I forcefully put him to sleep.</p><p>But he said he had plans, so I carried him all the way here.</p><p>Fufufu. Me giving Maa-kun a piggyback. It’s the opposite of the usual…♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Umm. This might be a silly question, but what do you mean by forcefully putting him to sleep? Did you strike the back of his neck?</p><p>Please don’t be too violent with him, if you can…?”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “As if I’ll ever hurt Maa-kun. Keep your sleeptalking for when you’re in bed.</p><p>Putting him to sleep is easy enough. I’ve just got to sprinkle a little bit of magic…♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “M-Magic?”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Mm-hmm. First, Maa-kun has this habit of listening to music before he sleeps. So I secretly mixed my song into his playlist.</p><p>But in a frequency normal people can’t pick up, you see… And then I set it so it would be played right as he falls to sleep.</p><p>I’m free to enter and leave Maa-kun’s place, so I could easily set all of this up.</p><p>And when this is done, what a surprise! The brain creates a condition… in which Maa-kun would fall fast asleep whenever he hears my singing voice♪</p><p>Fufufu. That was a lot of work~ I poured a lot of time into this trick, you know♪”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/DzKIQh7.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “……(<em>appropriately grossed out</em>)”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “…….(<em>makes a face that says ‘So there’s that trick!’</em>)”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Well, jokes aside.

Right, wasn’t it?</p><p>Ritsu-kun is the little brother of that Sakuma-senpai. Of course you won’t resort to criminal acts the Izumi-san way…♪”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Don’t bring up Anija every time you talk about me.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Hey, isn’t it weird that my name would appear in that conversation?</p><p>I admit I caused a scene back then, but I do think carefully about the laws when I act these days, you know?”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Reaally? Then why—I’ve avoided pointing this out so far, but—why have you been videotaping Yuu-kun, Secchan?</p><p>That’s not touching the laws, sure, but it counts as disturbing conduct, right?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, don’t take it the wrong way. I asked him to videotape me.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “I got you. You poor thing, Secchan must’ve forced you to say that. Why don’t we go to the police box? Let’s report the truth to the cops and have them protect you?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Kuma-kuuun…?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No, seriously. I’m bad with cameras, you see…</p><p>But SS will rake in a lot of audience from outside, and it’ll get huge coverage on TV.</p><p>Countless of cameras and eyes will be on me, so I thought I should get used to it while I can.</p><p>So, well, Izumi-san’s going along with my training for that?”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Haha~ You’re thinking things through… Same, Maa-kun also asked me to go along with his training.</p><p>Knights doesn’t hold back with fanservice, so I taught him tricks and tips on it.</p><p>We had Maa-kun’s rebellious little sister as the audience, and he had to work to please her.</p><p>Fufu, so you guys are really going for the win, Trickstar?</p><p>Great going… Like Suu-chan said, we’re rivals, so you producing good results would automatically elevate our status.</p><p>Nothing’s easier than getting better evaluation without working for it… And easy is good~ Fufufu♪”</p><h3 id="3">/ 3</h3><p><strong>&gt; Shopping Mall 1st Floor</strong></p><p>[Two hours later]</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “All right, I think we visited everything.</p><p>That was time well spent~ Please wait a bit, I’m going to summarize all the info I’ve gathered onto my laptop.</p><p>Tac-tac-tac♪ (<em>keyboard clicking</em>)”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Yuu-kuuun…?</p><p>I don’t want to bother you while you’re working, but heey, just what was the meaning of those actions we took so far?</p><p>It’s nothing like the date I imagined! We’re doing it over! Once more, I say!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I told you we’re not on a date… You can be like a troublesome girl sometimes, Izumi-san.</p><p>No, well, not like I <em>actually</em> know any troublesome girls. Just speaking based on image.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Haah? Who are you calling a troublesome girl!?”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Huh, you weren’t self-aware, Secchan? What a surprise~ You act like Maa-kun’s little sister sometimes… like a pubescent girl, in other words♪”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “I don’t wanna hear that from <em>you</em>, Kuma-kun! Eh? I’m like a girl? No waay, am I starting to resemble Naru-kun?”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Ah, so if you’re to categorize, you would count Nacchan as a girl, Secchan?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “<em>If</em> <em>I had to categorize</em>. But that one’s more like, ‘Gender: Narukami Arashi’.</p><p>And they’re best treated that way. Naru-kun will look at you weird when you treat them too much like a girl.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Ahaha, Knights is a gathering of troublesome people…♪</p><p>Ideal environment for Secchan, lover of troublesome things. You’ve got to thank us, Secchan, we will work to heap up more troubles for you in the future♪”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Haah? What the heck? Sooo annoying. I’m asking you, obey my words every once in a while.</p><p>We’re the same age, but you’re of lower grade than me.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Eh~ Don’t I listen to you enough…? You need to make a ‘promise’ by sacrificing something yourself if you’re going to demand more.</p><p>It gets too restrictive with too many promises though, so I think it’ll be nice if our laid-back relationship can go on forever.</p><p>Also, just in case. I’ll start an explanation for Secchan, who can be dull when it comes to Yuu-kun…</p><p>I think Yuu-kun came here today to probe Eden’s movements.</p><p>Indirectly questioning the passers-by made clear one thing to me: Eden’s holding a concert in this shopping mall today.</p><p>Yuu-kun came to see that, probably.</p><p>He’s been avoiding the center hall where the concert would take place, maybe so the enemy wouldn’t notice him.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Haah? Eden? Ah… the strongest in our age group, said to be Trickstar’s greatest enemy for SS or something?</p><p>And they have Tomoe and Ran, who transferred from Yumenosaki, right?</p><p>I hate those guys….</p><p>There’s the annoying thing with them acting like they’re Trickstar’s rivals, disregarding <em>us</em>, but they also invade my workplace from time to time.</p><p>They make-believe as models and steal the good jobs away.</p><p>Sooo irritating. Can you believe they even plundered some of the best cameramen?”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Hmm… From what Ecchan was saying, they’re plundering human resources from other places too.</p><p>This is part of the ‘huge wave’, I guess. Nothing that really involves us students… us children.</p><p>But you’re a third year, Secchan, so it’s going to affect your future plans. You should get a good grasp of the situation just in case.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “You should have been in the same situation, Kuma-kun. Yet you’re a relaxed second year thanks to repeating a grade… You have to move up to the third year this time, okay?”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Oui. Sure, sure. It’s okay. I pull through where it counts.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Wonder about that… Anyway, I’ve been hearing some fishy stories lately too.</p><p>Like how kids who haven’t got to shine much are getting scouted by <em>that</em> agency and transferring there.</p><p>They’re being dumb, there’s no such thing as an easy path… Not everyone would get warm reception like those two ex-_fine_s.</p><p>After all that time taking it easy, never playing the cards that must be played…</p><p>They shouldn’t be aiming for a turnabout so late into the game, geez. The world’s not so kind.</p><p>Useless people stay useless wherever they go.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Yup, yup. In the end, it’s all about skills… On the contrary, you have the grounds to be able to survive any kind of environment, Secchan, and you’re actually putting in effort.</p><p>But when someone’s neither that nor a genius like the King… they’ll just end up in even crueler hell after running away from one hell.</p><p>So it’s all about which hell you can get used to.</p><p>I’m going to sound like Ecchan, but if you don’t have the backbone to fight on despite suffering or being hurt…</p><p>Then you shouldn’t be aiming to be an idol. Not everyone can be one.</p><p>At home, you’re free to sit around with your mouth open, just waiting patiently for Papa and Mama to spoon feed you…</p><p>But once you’re outside, it’s a world of dog eats dog.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Oh, you know your stuff. So why I wonder, despite knowing all of this, does Kuma-kun keep having other people take care of him, even outside of home?</p><p>I’ll start charging you.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Eh~ But haven’t I been working hard lately…?”</p><h3 id="4">/ 4</h3><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/YdaFy2k.jpg"></p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Anyway, right now… Maa-kun is trying to use the energy he usually spends on others for himself.</p><p>It’s lonely, but until SS ends, I’ll take care of myself so I won’t be a burden to Maa-kun.</p><p>Because I want Maa-kun to win. For hardworker types like Maa-kun and you Secchan, what you really need is victory.</p><p>You need result and conviction, that hard work <em>does</em> pay off in the end.</p><p>People can keep running when they can see the finish line, the goal they must achieve. The human ego isn’t made to run on and on without any end in sight.</p><p>Even someone with crazy endurance like you, Secchan, were worn down and corroding until the King returned.</p><p>You were tired from holding onto a battle with no end or goal in sight.</p><p>I got worried from watching. But well, without the King around, Nacchan and I and Suu-chan who were left with you…</p><p>…seemed to have established within you a new goal: to support your comrades.</p><p>And of course, there’s <em>Yuu-kun</em>… You strive to protect him, love him, and not lose him the second time.</p><p>These were your renewed conditions of victory. They’re what you’ve been alive to accomplish.</p><p>But thanks to the King’s return, the condition of victory you once failed to fulfill came back to life…</p><p>And I think you’re confused on which to prioritize.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Hey, can you stop psychoanalyzing me like that? It’s your bad habit, Kuma-kun.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “I analyze because I’m interested. This side of me, unfortunately, is no different from Anija… We’re both in love with humanity.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “…All right, I’m done summing up. Sorry to keep you both waiting.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “It’s cool. Secchan and I were killing time having a pretend-deep chat.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “To be honest, it’s good that I have Kuma-kun to talk to. So far, you kept running ahead of me whenever we entered the shops, Yuu-kun…</p><p>Waiting in front of the shop alone and forsaken would’ve been too depressing.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “You really stand out, Izumi-san. I couldn’t probe for the staffs and the buyers’ natural reactions with you around…</p><p>By myself, I could slip into the atmosphere, though.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Indeed, that was impressive undercover action, de gozaru.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Why the sudden ninja speak? Well, I did pick up some of that from Sengoku-kun…</p><p>That boy looks like he’s just made up of trivia and ideas, but he seriously practices ninjutsu and knows it. It’s amazing.</p><p>Anyway, I was listening to your talk while I was typing, and it’s just as Ritsu-kun guessed… I’m here today to research Eden’s actions.</p><p>Eden is doing concerts and thorough advertising in this area before SS.</p><p>Since SS is a nationwide event, a lot of the audience will be coming from afar…</p><p>But it’s still mainly going to be locals.</p><p>Depending on whether you can get the local population and stores on your side, the atmosphere and heat on the day of will change greatly.</p><p>Today they’re holding an especially large-scale live…</p><p>Not just people living around the shopping mall area, but audience from all surrounding areas and from afar will be coming.</p><p>If they can make a strong impression here, it’ll be good influence for SS. I’m impressed; Eden’s really precise in the cards they play.</p><p>I’d hate for another Summer Live to happen, so I need to research how far Eden has gone with their plans, before the event.</p><p>I think that’s more worthwhile than spending my break spacing out.</p><p>I <em>can</em> get the same results just through researching social medias, but that would have taken more time…</p><p>And I get a better feel of the situation by actually searching the scene, anyway.</p><p>Check the scene of the crime a hundred times! This goes for both detective work <em>and</em> idol work♪”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “What a cheek… Then what, was I a bother? Since I wasn’t needed in the detective work you came here for?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No, you weren’t really a bother. You made for a good lightning rod to divert people’s attention when I had to move, Izumi-san.</p><p>Thanks to everyone looking at Izumi-san, I didn’t have to get noticed…♪”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Ahaha. You’re the only one all excited thinking this was a date, Secchan♪”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “That’s awful! You’re such a naughty boy, Yuu-kun, toying with my pure heart…!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Geez, why act like the victim when you’re the one who insisted to tag along… It’s like I did something bad. What a troublesome person, really.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Fufu. That’s because Secchan is also Knights. Love complicates people…♪</p><p>Hey, Yuu-kun. Secchan will be a pain to deal with when he starts sulking, so cheer him up some.</p><p>…How about showing him the thing you’ve been hiding in your pocket already?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, right. So you noticed. You’re so sharp, Ritsu-kun.</p><p>Umm, Izumi-san, here… I bought this just then from that shop over there.</p><p>It’s a Christmas present, to thank you for the muffler.</p><p>I was caught up with a lot of things around Christmas and had no time to prepare anything, so I couldn’t give you anything back that time… It’s late, but will you accept?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Eh… W-What is it?

It’s that cosmetic product Yuu-kun and I modeled the commercial for long ago…☆</p><p>Sooo nostalgic! Ahaha, I recall it had this silly catchphrase like, ‘Even boys want to be pretty’ or something…♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah. Isn’t it nostalgic~? I didn’t think they’d still be selling such an old stuff…</p><p>It was a fresh concept when it first came out, though. Cosmetics for grade schoolers—for boys, even.</p><p>Fufu. Izumi-san, you really kicked a fuss during the shoot.</p><p>We were supposed to be using the product for the shoot… but you were so against it for some reason.</p><p>At the end, you even started crying ‘No!

Can you not forge false memories, Yuu-kun!?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. You don’t have to be so embarrassed~ We were at the lower levels of grade school back then… It’s natural to be crying when you don’t like something.</p><p>I was almost constantly in tears, after all.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Uugh~ But you always did a perfect job at the end, Yuu-kun. You’ve always been great when it comes to the real deal, since the past.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Because you’d always encourage me to your best ability whenever I cried, Izumi-san.</p><p>But during this cosmetic commercial, Izumi-san was the one looking shaken for a change…</p><p>It came off as quite a shock to me to see the usually dependable Onii-chan crying, you know.</p><p>That’s why I remember it vividly until now.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “F-Forget it! It’s embarrassing! It’s just, I was having a weird misunderstanding back then!</p><p>So they showed me around a place where they did special makeup effects, for future reference, you know?</p><p>There, I saw people’s faces looked like they melted when the makeup was applied…</p><p>And I was scared thinking it might happen to me. Looking back now, I was being incredibly dumb.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Ahaha. So there was a time you were adorable, Secchan♪”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Hmph. I bet you were an uncute and cold brat since the past, Kuma-kun.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Yep. My current self is a hundred times cuter than my old self…☆”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Where did that confidence even well up from? You’re impossible… Well, back to topic. In the end, we dealt with the photo shoot without the makeup, didn’t I?</p><p>Even if it was a cosmetic commercial, it’s not like the models <em>had</em> to wear the cosmetic.</p><p>I think they made the right choice~ It wouldn’t be funny if our developing, smooth skin got messed up by some cosmetics.</p><p>Even without makeup, back then we were angels manifold more beautiful and adorable than some random models…♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “It <em>did</em> have great feedback.</p><p>It’s not all thanks to us of course, but it seems to have become popular enough to still be sold even to this day.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Yeah, that was a huge success.

I can never show an unseemly side in front of those eyes.</p><p>Thanks to that, I’m still getting appraised as a model to this day.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. Then that’s really not thanks to me… It just means you’re strong, and that you’re fit to be a model, Izumi-san.</p><p>When I was shaken, you would be there. And when you were about to cry, I would…</p><p>By supporting each other like that, we really shone before the camera back then.</p><p>The adults probably thought pairing us together was the right choice. After that, we got more work as a set, I think.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Those were happy times. Well, as a result, more work piled up, and the demands became increasingly difficult…</p><p>Yet, we were too young to cope with all of that.</p><p>We both had familial troubles happening then, and things got out of hand.</p><p>In the end, we couldn’t stay at that radiant place. Position-wise, and mentally too…</p><p>But you know, while I don’t want to affirm even the bad parts, I think things turned out fine.</p><p>We can smile so close to each other like now.</p><p>We restored our relationship to the point we could give each other presents, and spend holidays together aimlessly like now.</p><p>And all of that’s… enough of a happy end for me♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Don’t go ahead and call it the ‘end’… This is where things start for me.</p><p>Watch me, Onii-chan.

But isn’t it fine for miracles like that to happen once in a while?</p><p>After competing against Trickstar many times, we remember how you dance and stuff.</p><p>And we’re used to performing ad-lib because of how our King likes to compose songs on the spot.</p><p>We can be stand-ins for the absent two. We have no word to return if you say we’re butting in too much, though… so we’ll quietly step down in that case, but you know?</p><p>You should let me do this much.

Sure is pathetic coming from the bunch said to be the strongest-whatever…</p><p>So your glory is as fragile as a house of cards, crumbling down at the addition of an unexpected factor like us?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “That’s not it, Kuma-kun. These guys can only fight people they know they can win against. You know, despite criticizing us for fixed games and all that…?</p><p>A serious match full of things unforeseen, where they have a chance of losing, spooks them too much to take on.</p><p>What embarrassing excuses for men.

Anyway you should look at this!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “What is it~ Don’t shove your smartphone at me~…</p><p>…Ooh, what’s this. Eden and Trickstar, two of the groups set out for SS, are having a magnificent clash at the shopping mall!</p><p>Or so the headline says on the news site!</p><p>Eh? We clashed? I didn’t hear anything! This is from today… noon? Huuh?</p><p>I thought we were supposed to be resting until the meeting in the afternoon today?”</p><p>(Hmm… Considering the time, the clash at the shopping mall is likely over.</p><p>It’s already becoming news, after all.</p><p>Would be too late to catch up to them, I guess. And Ukki and Sally would’ve called if I was needed.</p><p>Hmm~ But the curiosity is killing me, so maybe I should take a look?</p><p>But then if I go to the shopping mall from now, I might not make it in time for Trickstar’s meeting in the afternoon?</p><p>Right, we might just miss each other.

There are manners even between close friends, as there are ears on walls and eyes on doors!</p><p>You’re our school’s representative. You don’t know who might be watching, so take care with your words and actions.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Sure, sure. Roger. You surprisingly like to scold given the chance, Chii-chan-senpai.</p><p>I’ll go home if all you do is complain. I’m taking the time to play with you since you seem to have nothing to do, you know~?”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I <em>do</em> have things to do, at the right time, Akehoshi!

I think I heard something about it from someone?</p><p>Ah, it was Anzu! Anzu said she joined UNDEAD’s year-end party, was that the same thing?</p><p>So it was a PV shoot? Then she’s working like always!</p><p>Gee, that Anzu~ After telling us to rest!</p><p>I thought by year-end party it means she was taking it slow and partying with people she’s comfortable with! This is a betrayal, madam!”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Who’s a madam? Anyway, I think it’s wrong to call out a white lie as a betrayal.</p><p>She needs to pretend that she’s properly resting in front of you guys, that’s why she said that.</p><p>In reality, Anzu was unused to PV shoots, and the other staffs on the scene were the ones getting most things done. It’s not like she’s working herself to the bones.</p><p>Take it as that she’s doing the minimum possible work to keep her senses sharp.</p><p>Just like how you’re joining the Basketball Club practice to keep your body fit right now.</p><p>Rolling around in bed isn’t the only thing that constitutes as resting. Anzu’s probably had enough of that, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hmm~… I don’t mind, since you need to first fool your allies to fool your enemies…</p><p>Ukki’s a similar type, and it’s not like they need to share everything they’re thinking just because we’re friends.</p><p>But in the end, I don’t think it’s anything to hide… I wish she could say a word or two. We won’t get angry.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Hnn~ You guys have been a little too sensitive since Anzu’s hospitalization.</p><p>You’ve been treating ‘working’ like it’s a taboo. Maybe that was suffocating for Anzu.</p><p>You say you won’t get angry, but from the side, it does look like you’re reproaching her. That sort of pressure and lack of faith can most hurt the person you hold dear, you know.</p><p>If you’re friends and comrades, have more faith. We’re all humans here; we might make mistakes and stumble.</p><p>But that’s not to be reproached, but to be accepted. Stretch out your hand so you can walk together.</p><p>I once failed to stop Ryuuseitai from breaking apart.</p><p>I was scared of losing my place by criticizing others and getting into a clash, so I held my tongue and watched on as everything fell apart.</p><p>So I thought I shouldn’t let something similar ever happen again.</p><p>Like in Himitsu Sentai Gore*ger, after losing all my old comrades, I now walk together with the surviving kids I met due to a miracle.</p><p>If it’s you, you can do better than I did… or I guess that’s not a good way to phrase it. You can miraculously get every problem resolved.</p><p>Do your best, Main Character! Effort, friendship, victory!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You sure like to ramble on about things that might or might not have substance… But your words tend to be needlessly filled with reality, Chii-chan-senpai, so they <em>are</em> pretty convincing.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fuhaha! Life has been a series of failures, as it stands! But each tear I shed makes me the stronger, and to not bother looking back is what youth is all about!</p><p>Someday scars will become crust and fall off, and it will make me grow manifold stronger…☆”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Fufu. It’s nice how peaceful it is with you, Chii-chan-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Of course! Peace is number one!</p><p>Truth be told… there was no time for festivities like year-end parties around this time of last year.</p><p>I was one of those who had it easier, but it was a cold winter, in many different ways.</p><p>Enjoying the fun sort of clamor with your comrades, laughing, imagining the future… I never guessed a time like this would come, and the present we have is definitely far better than that past.</p><p>Thank you, Akehoshi. You guys changed everything for us.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nn~ Maybe you should thank Eichi-senpai instead? We didn’t do anything in particular. We just gave it our all in what we wanted to do!</p><p>And what we wanted was to shine even, even brighter!</p><p>So, leaving all the difficult problems to the seniors, we’re just gonna go on a rampage as we like!”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Yes!

Actually, it’s one of the 44 Secrets hidden in Morisawa Chiaki’s basketball form…☆</p><p>Changing clothes also changes my frame of mind. And at a different state of heart, how I operate and how much power I put would differ as well.</p><p>By ‘transforming’, purposely acting out a role, I can become manifold stronger than my usual self.</p><p>I establish an ideal, and try to get closer to the image I have by changing into another costume.</p><p>I can’t physically transform like cyborgs or warriors from the land of light.</p><p>And people who know what I’m actually like might view it weirdly, as if I’m letting the costume wear me or faking my character.</p><p>But a hero was not born a hero.

Did you say something, Akehoshi?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nothing; don’t break out into impassioned speech while holding the ball.

I thought there’s no way I can’t do what someone like Chii-chan-senpai can, so I practiced!</p><p>Did you see? Did you see? I cleanly got it in~☆”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I did! Splendid, Akehoshi! I have nothing else to teach you… There, there♪</p><p>You, and Isara too… You both skillfully accomplish whatever you’re told to do. You guys are geniuses.</p><p>There are few high school students with your height who can dunk.</p><p>If you focus on basketball, you might even become a first-class athlete. Yet you want to be an idol, right?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yep. I do like basketball~ But becoming an idol has been my dream since I was a child.</p><p>I only started basketball after enrolling to high school, because Chii-chan-senpai invited me.</p><p>My passion for it isn’t enough yet, or more like, I don’t care enough to abandon becoming an idol in favor of it.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Ahaha. You grow rapidly, so as the Basketball Club captain, I can’t help being greedy and wanting to take on the championship.</p><p>But first of all, you need to take the throne as an idol. Only one in a million is granted the right to reach out for that seat.</p><p>I’d take your place if I could, but you have no choice but to do it. Do your best, Akehoshi, Trickstar… Make your dreams come true and come back.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Of course. Keep your eyes open and watch, Chii-chan-senpai.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “I will! Don’t hesitate to call for me when you’re in trouble!

You’ve always come to my rescue when I needed you, Chii-chan-senpai.</p><p>You’re dense and clueless, so I always thought it was weird.</p><p>But Chii-chan-senpai, you actually come to anyone’s rescue at all times, without asking questions, don’t you?</p><p>So it’s just your good luck that the person you’re trying to rescue is actually in trouble for some of those.</p><p>It’s a ‘fake it till you make it’ kind of thing~ You don’t bother thinking before you act, whether the person actually needed help from the heart.</p><p>So even when we’re totally doing fine here…</p><p>You say things like ‘Are you okay?’ ‘Should I help?’ ‘Cheer up!’ and that’s why people are annoyed.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Fuhaha. Sometimes, being careful with the other person’s circumstances can make it too late to take actions.</p><p>If that means I might overlook someone in trouble, then I’d rather be treated like an annoyance.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Wow, cool. That’s why I like you, and think you’re a real hero, Chii-chan-senpai.</p><p>Thanks. For saving me when I was alone, loong ago. Even though there was nothing in it for you…</p><p>I was deeply moved, and happy, to know there was someone like you.</p><p>Thanks for calling out to me that day. For putting me in the Basketball Club, for inviting me to do club activities with you almost everyday…</p><p>Just by you doing that, I felt lighter.</p><p>I reached my happiness. I made the most out of my youth. I never got discouraged enough to run away, and now, I’ve even grasped the right to stand on a huge stage.</p><p>I’m grateful. It might be in a hero to not seek repayment, but let me say thank you, at least.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Eh, what’s wrong, Akehoshi? It’s like you’re leaving to become a bride… I’m lonely.</p><p>Are you becoming nervous, as it’s right before the unprecedented grand stage?</p><p>You don’t need to feel like you owe me. I just did the natural thing. As a first year, you looked really lonely, not having any friends.</p><p>I thought you were to be pitied, so I called out to you. That’s all there was to it, and you weren’t special.</p><p>I would’ve done the same to anyone other than you.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “This bastard… Ah well, it’s more comfortable that way.</p><p>Son of ‘that Akehoshi’, genius, main character, they say; there were more times I’ve been put on a pedestal, but…</p><p>The me who felt lonely for having no friends was still me, and Chii-chan-senpai saved that me.</p><p>So really, I’m just repeating myself, but… thanks.</p><p>I’ll definitely win. I’ll win with a laugh, and become happy.”</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> “Akehoshi~! It really sounds like you’re leaving to become someone’s bride!

I wouldn’t care if you had scheduled something… Since we’re talking about a play at a new theater, I doubt there’s much slack in time, right?</p><p>I’ll start practicing the role if you give it to me now. I’m resting until SS and I don’t have much to do, so it’s better to have a distraction.”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “Hmm. In your case… you lack talent at a fundamental level, so nothing much would change by giving you time to practice, I think.</p><p>There isn’t much difference between you acting on impromptu, or after great amount of practice.</p><p>In fact, you’d start misunderstanding things in a mysterious way, wander a full circle, and end up with worse acting than you started with.</p><p>Honestly, you are the nightmare of every instructor.</p><p>On that point… Tomoya-kun absorbs what he’s taught like a sponge, so he is interesting to instruct.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Tell that to the kid. He hates you like poison because you only ever train him harshly, or toy with him.</p><p>Youths these days are raised with love and care, so they practically need to be praised for something as simple as breathing—</p><p>Or they’ll be frustrated, like they’re not getting what they should be naturally granted.</p><p>That’s what Grandma said.

I thought a different need might call for it in the future.</p><p>We used the club budget to get it made, so would it not be a waste to throw it away?</p><p>You are aware I was subjugated as part of the Five Oddballs back then.</p><p>Club members kept dropping, and we had an economic sanction in which our budget was cut.</p><p>I thought I should find use for every item on hand, so I retrieved it for recycling purposes.</p><p>Costumes, stage properties, stage sets… I have been using them with care for a while now.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I didn’t think you’d have a cheapskate mentality, buchou.”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “I have done my share of street performances~ I understand the gravity of a few coins.</p><p>While not vital for a human to live on, it is the natural mindset to be assumed by any who chooses to eat through doing art.</p><p>Don’t take youth and money for granted…♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Buchou. I’ve always meant to ask this, but why did you make me stand on the same stage as you that day?</p><p>Was I purely a stand-in to fill the blank, to comply to the rules of the unit system?</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/7aKEpO3.jpg"></p><p>At that time, you were thoroughly mangled as one of the Five Oddballs, and you were probably too driven to a corner to have the leisure to think…</p><p>So I wouldn’t question if you say there was no particular meaning.</p><p>But I can’t help thinking you had some sort of motive, when I look back to the days I’ve spent since then to this day.</p><p>In hindsight… now I have avenged you, who were killed as a villain that day. So was it for a revenge plot that you included me?</p><p>During those times, I was the closest person to you. Not the other Five Oddballs, and obviously not the student council president…</p><p>It was me, who spent every day training with you in the Theater Club.</p><p>I’m a person, I get attached to things and people I always have around. I even look up to you as an actor.</p><p>And then I had to watch you getting unreasonably vilified and crushed underfoot before my eyes.</p><p>Of course that sprouted a desire for vengeance within me. I was discontent, I couldn’t stand the unfairness of it; my heart was set aflame in wrath.</p><p>…I was so frustrated, buchou.</p><p>My anger from that time led me to the revolution we caused after. But my earliest motive was that: a childish grudge.</p><p>Revolutions and all that lofty spiels came following after.</p><p>You were the one who sowed the buds of that revolution.</p><p>And then you once again engineered yourself to be slain in DDD, directly assisting our revolution.</p><p>If you weren’t there, our revolution wouldn’t have succeeded… It wouldn’t even have started.</p><p>Why are you always like that? Why do you always long to be the monster slain by heroes? Why do you go out of your way to sacrifice yourself?”</p><h3 id="16">/ 16</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It’s like I’m dancing on top of your palm, as you want me to… it’s irritating.</p><p>If there’s something you want to be done, do it yourself like a normal person.</p><p>The vicissitudes of fate led the irrelevant third-rate phantom Hokke Mask to become a hero.</p><p>But you and your sacrifice will never get rewarded.</p><p>The spectators won’t ever notice. Even though you were at the beginning and the center of everything; the main character.</p><p>Even though you had the skills, charm, fate befitting of that role… Why?</p><p>Why do you retreat to the stage wing at the most important times?”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “That is overestimating me too much, and the main role isn’t the only role there is.</p><p>I love any role from the bottom of my heart, so I let the children who want to play the main role have it.</p><p>Though it may be arrogant to say I <em>let</em> them… But still, I like this position.</p><p>After all, to play the main role means I cannot witness the main role with these eyes, yes?</p><p>I want to fraternize with the main role. With a different individual in my position.</p><p>In this reality, I was born under odd stars that bestowed me with a great many talents and fates, often framing me into a main character-like presence… So at least, when on top of a stage.</p><p>After standing shoulder-to-shoulder with my equals as one of the Five Oddballs, that wish was granted to some extent.</p><p>So, well, I have nothing to regret about my last stage as one of the Five Oddballs.</p><p>My dream was already granted long ago. Thus, I had no reason to seek revenge. You are overthinking it, Hokuto-kun.</p><p>Only, you are a thoroughbred of the entertainment world… To be perfect and excellent is what’s expected of you, and you’ve worked hard to correspond to that expectation. But reality is cruel.</p><p>You are a person, so you can fail.</p><p>And as Hidaka Hokuto-kun is supposed to be a genius, born to two eminent people, your failures are more fatal to you than normal people.</p><p>When you betray the expectation of the masses, the insult, criticism, and malice directed at you may fester to no end.</p><p>I wanted you to earn the fortitude to bear all that.</p><p>Because you’ve stood by someone like me so far, for reasons I can’t begin to guess.</p><p>You should know what I am like; companionship with me does not tend to hold out for long.</p><p>Yet like it’s the most normal thing to do, even when you are appalled or fed up with me, you would still show up in the club room the next day.</p><p>That made me happy, you see.</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/QnNh0Uf.jpg"></p><p>Really. Perhaps far, far more than you can imagine.</p><p>For a long time, we spent idle everyday together. This is embarrassing to admit, but that was a first for me since I was born.</p><p>I do not know how to describe my relationship with you.</p><p>We are too distant to equate to friends or family, but not so business-like as to be framed as simply work partners.</p><p>A teacher and his pupil wouldn’t fit either, for I haven’t particularly taught you anything.</p><p>We are simply together before we knew it, and happen to be familiar enough to have a light exchange whenever we run into each other.</p><p>I tend to take anything to the extremity, so such thing was really a first for me. I was happy.</p><p>That is why—while not quite as an expression of thanks—I had you stand on that hellish stage in the finale.</p><p>On that fearsome stage, in which the audience, co-actors, and the rest of the world that wasn’t even present, were against me.</p><p>There, without knowing what I was truly like or what I felt, I was vilified and thrown stones and garbage at, simply because that’s the natural thing to do…</p><p>That stage was in itself the tortures of hell.</p><p>But even at such stage, the pitiful pierrot could smile contented… I wanted you to know that.</p><p>By showing you a glimpse of that hell, as my extra—</p><p>If the time comes that you have to endure the same torture, I was hoping you’d breeze through it without wavering.</p><p>You can be strangely sturdy, and an experience you’ve had once before rarely falters you the second time, right?</p><p>You are a poor learner with no talent, but you carry what you’ve learned through experience to your grave.</p><p>Slowly perhaps, but the data are recorded and built within you.</p><p>Thus I had you take part in a tragedy that does not happen often.</p><p>That’s all there is to it. Don’t try too hard to seek meaning and depth… Hokke Mask-kun.”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/myaceJk.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m Hidaka Hokuto. This mask doesn’t suit me anymore.</p><p>I don’t mind taking this as a memento. But I can act out a role without putting on a physical mask.</p><p>I can become a monster who smiles even when faced with the entire world as my enemy.</p><p>…There’s a guy who likes underhanded tactics among Eden, our greatest adversary for SS.</p><p>Perhaps he’ll drive us to a situation like that hellish stage.</p><p>I’m sure the experience you let me absorb would do good when the time comes. Thanks, buchou. Your sacrifice won’t be forgotten.”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “No, can you please not talk like I’m <em>really</em> dead? A play is a play, and reality is reality!</p><p>Please make the distinction; if you mix up both, you might end up like me~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. Except there <em>have</em> been times I wished I could be like you.</p><p>Ah well. Have you solved the box, buchou?”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “Yes, in a bit…</p><p>Ah, I solved everything! &lt;Amazing☆&gt;”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Good work. You really helped; if it was just me, the year would be changing before I get to solve it.”</p><p><strong>Wataru:</strong> “Fufufu. There is no need for thanks. But it would be awkward if there ends up being a diary of Hokuto-kun’s father inside, so I shall be taking my leave!</p><p>Until we meet again, farewell!</p><p>…Please do your best in SS. Like your namesake the Big Dipper, become a guidepost to the other members, who may lose way easily.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I will.

A fine weather…☆</p><p>Just kidding~♪ Yeah, I’ve been studying videos of Eden’s live performances until today, so that catchphrase really stuck with me!</p><p>It just goes to show that great idols greatly influence their surrounding people, don’t you think~?♪</p><p>…Whoa?</p><p>Ooi? Anzu, why are you hugging me? This is sexual harassment, Producer♪</p><p>Ahaha♪ I see, are you trying to say that you’ve been influenced by my hugging habit?</p><p>You’re implicating that I’m also a great idol?

And he actually joins in the hug!</p><p>Usually this is the part where he would coolly go ‘Don’t be stupid’ or ‘You’ll burn out if you start with that much energy’!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmph. We’ve had our rest until today, so you’re free to maintain that energy of yours from start to finish.</p><p>Don’t complicate yourself with unnecessary planning. To give so much that we pass out the moment the event ends would be about right.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha! Do that and we’ll inevitably spend the new year sleeping in! Sounds like a good recipe for a good first dream of the year~☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. So let’s exert all effort to allow that.</p><p>…Ahh. It’s really nice how warm your body temperatures are. The mornings are cold as it’s still midwinter, so you guys come in handy.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh? Just when we thought he’s being unusually touchy, he’s actually using us as source of warmth like hot water bottles~?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You treated me like an ice pack throughout summer. It’s fair.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Surprisingly a retaliative one, isn’t he~… But seriously Hokke, you’re freezing cold to your fingertips. It’s like you’re made of ice.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. Embarrassingly, I think my blood has gone cold from the nerves.</p><p>My legs keep shivering when I’m alone; reuniting with you guys just brought me back to life.</p><p>Thanks. I’m happy that you guys are with me to stand on the grand stage I’ve dreamed of.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Same here. It really is like a dream~ I still can’t believe SS is happening today.</p><p>I feel like DDD was only yesterday.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m the opposite.

Come and join us!</p><p>As a ceremony before taking on SS, let’s all hug and share warmth!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “That’s fine and all… But you two are hugging too firmly there that you’re practically squashing the life of Anzu.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Whoa, I’m sorry!?</p><p>Anzu is so soft compared to Hokke and everyone, so my hands just sink into her like she’s made of liquid!

So big!</p><p>The Yumenosaki Academy Auditorium is also a fancy building, but this is an entirely different level~… How many people can get in?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Well, just by estimation, there will be more people than we’ve ever had before.</p><p>But that dome is the stage for the real battle, so who knows if we’ll actually get to sing there.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, so SS consists of preliminaries and after that the real stage, was it?</p><p>It’s common with large-scale DreamFests in Yumenosaki, so it’s an everyday thing for us!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. But idols from other places might be surprised~ We might have an advantage for dealing with such battles on daily basis♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. I’m glad. You guys seem relaxed.</p><p>You’re all acting like your usual selves… And I’m the only one shivering from my nervousness, it’s embarrassing.</p><p>Even Yuuki, who would normally have a fright before a big stage, is acting so dignified.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. I’ve also grown, Hidaka-kun. I’m not running away anywhere, and I’ve had my mental preparation done and over with.</p><p>I was always the type who’s strong on the real deal since I was a kid anyway♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nah… I might get cold feet once they actually put the audience in front of me.</p><p>I can stay calm right now only because it hasn’t sunk on me yet.</p><p>Do you see all those people gathering who look like they’re here for SS, even though the opening ceremony hasn’t even started?</p><p>There’s going to be more of them as hours pass, right?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah yeah, it’s just <em>the best</em>! I wish the entire human race <em>all</em> over the world would come see us!</p><p>It’s a pity that’s physically difficult!

Isn’t this the waiting room for SS contenders?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Not ‘contenders’ nor ‘waiting room’. It’s the ‘dressing room’ for ‘participating idols’.</p><p>They’re giving a dressing room for each unit, so it’s natural there would be no one here.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I see~ That’s kinda troubling… Actually, Barry called me to talk, so I thought I could pick a random time to greet them and use that chance to have whatever talk it is he has.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Barry…?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “That’s Saegusa-kun, I think. Huh, he called you to talk? I have only bad feelings about that!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah. For some reason, he called to my home number in the morning~</p><p>I wonder how he knew that number. We’re kind of hiding it from the public, for reasons.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Nn. That boy’s ability to gather intel is far more than to be reckoned with… Just how much does he know, I wonder?</p><p>During the joint interview and the shopping mall live the other day, I did try to search him up a bit…</p><p>But he’s impenetrable. Too scary.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Making us think that way is likely part of the strategy. There’s nothing to gain by being overly-anxious, and it’s dangerous to overestimate the enemy.</p><p>But I’m curious about him calling Akehoshi to talk.</p><p>Right before DDD, the student council president also called us, and that became the happening that ran a crack between us.</p><p>It’s going to be tough to regain calm within today, if something equal or worse were to happen.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “We had a week to spare during DDD but not this time…</p><p>Hmm~ This is looking to grow into a real-time battle that demands quicker decision-making and reaction than that time.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha, but isn’t that our specialty~?♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I agree. But it doesn’t erase my worry. Let’s find out the enemy’s intent and deal with it quick.</p><p>In the case of anything happening, make sure to always be in contact. We’ll tackle all problems together as a group.</p><p>…Hmm. I see, so you’ll be in charge of correspondence to make sure we’re all on the same page, Anzu? That’s a help. Please watch over us today as always, our Goddess of Victory.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Megamin, Megamin, that’s great and everything but are we not getting new costumes this time?</p><p>I don’t see anything but the standard Tricktar unit outfits in the locker~?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t just take the goddess―<em>megami</em>―part and say it like a nickname. It sounds like you’re mocking me, I don’t like it.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nah, but don’t you think calling a close friend of the same age a ‘goddess’ sounds more like a funny joke?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Don’t do that, Subaru. Hokuto is <em>serious</em>… He’s a guy who can say stuff like that with a straight face… That’s his virtue…”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. Anzu-chan has learned to brush it off by playfully replying with ‘<em>Yes, Goddess here~</em>’ anyway…</p><p>He’s called her that repeatedly time and time again, so it is practically a nickname.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmph… Well, I wasn’t exactly saying it to make her heart race, so that’s fine…</p><p>But it’s a little lonely when she brushes me off like that.</p><p>Anyway, back to topic. There’s no way Anzu wouldn’t prepare a new costume for SS.</p><p>We’re talking about someone who does needlework even when hospitalized.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Whoa, Anzu looks really down! Hey Hokke, that one just now sounds like sarcasm!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Right. I’m aware I shouldn’t keep rubbing it in. Humans make mistakes. So we should acknowledge that and reflect so we can advance together.</p><p>No―we <em>have</em> been advancing by doing that, which brought us where we stand now.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah, we’ve hit walls and lost our way…</p><p>But we kept going without breaking down, and that’s how we’ve arrived at today, participating in SS, the stage of longing for all idols.</p><p>Fufu. I feel like I can finally say from the bottom of my heart, that I’m an idol.</p><p>I’ve always been bothered… by ‘Yuuki Makoto, the model’ sitting in a small corner of my heart.</p><p>I felt somewhere, that I was lying to myself and only pretending to be an idol.</p><p>But now, I think even the me in that small corner is saying with a smile: ‘I’m an idol!’</p><p>Ehehe. I managed to become an idol like all of you, huh?</p><p>I’m so happy. It’s such an honor and I’m so proud; I want to commend myself.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Geez, don’t start acting like everything’s over and all’s left is to sleep, guys.</p><p>It’s just gonna start from now. Let’s restore our spirits and give it our all~♪</p><p>It’s seriously looking to be a severe battle where even a moment of inalert will be fatal.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eden isn’t our only opponent too~ Those amazing idols we fought during our ‘pilgrimage’ are also participating.</p><p>Professionals and amateurs alike, many of the best idols there are will be standing our way.</p><p>It’s gonna be next to impossible to do all of them in and win.</p><p>But if I can do that… I feel like Dad might finally smile. You know, I still can’t forget Dad’s face that I saw for the last time.</p><p>He looked purposeless and empty. That was the first and last I’ve ever seen that look on him…</p><p>I think, I became an idol because I wanted to change that to a smile.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, let’s put a smile on the face of everyone in the world. For that, we need to start by having fun and smiling ourselves.</p><p>Ultimately, it isn’t a problem of winning or losing.</p><p>Though <em>of course</em> I have all the intent to win. But the one who gets to have the most fun and spread the most fun is probably the one to take the trophy.”</p><h3 id="3-2">/ 3</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Hmm? What’s wrong, Anzu?</p><p>You seem restless. If you need the toilet, you should hurry before the opening ceremony starts. We won’t have much time to slow down after that.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, it’s almost nostalgic, hearing your lack of tact towards the other sex, Hidaka-kun…</p><p>Back when Anzu-chan just transferred, I think you often made the mistake of repeating such tactlessness.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmph, I was and <em>am</em> trying to be considerate, actually… It’s difficult; I just can’t get used to it.</p><p>I’m sorry for not acting like the prince of girls’ dreams, Anzu.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha, well, it isn’t bad to have a prince like that, no?</p><p>One that’s not too snobbish. We’re at an era where what’s accessible to the common people is what’s more widely acceptable, anyway.</p><p>Rather than that, I think Anzu wants us to change into our Trickstar outfits.</p><p>Look, she’s fidgeting while holding the outfits.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm, hmm… I understand now, Anzu. So you want us to wear the usual outfits for the opening ceremony and the preliminaries.</p><p>You made new costumes, but you’re planning to reveal them on the real stage?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. So, if we lose at the prelims, those new outfits will go to waste?</p><p>Now I absolutely can’t lose! I can’t not wear your new costume, Anzu!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Uh-huh… So the new costumes win at impact, but for preliminaries, you think it’s better to wear the usual outfits that the audience are likely more familiar with?</p><p>Yeah, I think that’s the right tactic.</p><p>We went on like a ‘pilgrimage’ over the country, and did our share of advertisements on TV and the internet, even if it’s a humble attempt compared to Eden’s.</p><p>For most of those times, we were wearing the usual unit outfits. Fans who think those outfits symbolize Trickstar are likely not few.</p><p>SS garners a large crowd of audience from outside…</p><p>I agree that it’s better to wear an outfit that more people know.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “True. I think we’ve all seen how unknown we were at national level…</p><p>Even if we appear with new costumes here, they might just go like ‘<em>Who are these guys even?</em>’</p><p>A fast ball is only effective when you’ve had a fair number of straightforward games.</p><p>If we do something that stands out without going through the steps, they’ll likely just ignore us.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Okay~ So dressing up is <em>after</em> we win the preliminaries; Roger! I’ll do my best so I can wear that new outfit Anzu made.</p><p>Watch. We’re gonna win this, Anzu.</p><p>…H-Huh? Anzu~? Why are you averting your eyes and backtracking? I said watch me!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Akehoshi. Don’t start changing in front of Anzu like it’s the most natural thing. Instead of me, <em>you’re</em> the one lacking any sort of tact towards the other sex here.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah. Sorry, sorry.</p><p>Hmm~… Next year the Producer Course will commence for real, and girls will start enrolling, so I should learn.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “<em>Speak of next year and demons will laugh</em>, ever heard of this saying? Let’s overcome SS first of all so we can greet the end of the year with satisfaction.</p><p>Ah~… If I don’t keep encouraging myself like that, I feel I might get a fright.</p><p>I think I’ll go crazy from nervousness, actually… I wish it’ll just start quick. For real.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It’s starting as we speak. There’s no time for leisure until the opening ceremony. Start getting changed.</p><p>…I’m sorry, but I need you to exit the room for a bit, Anzu.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nn~ But isn’t it cold out on the corridor since the heaters barely work? Anzu, you can stay in the room, so…</p><p>Use my eyemask; I’ll lend it to you. We’ll tell you when we’re done.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. It’s starting to get hectic, just like we always are, I guess…♪”</p><p>&gt; SS Dome Event Hall (Lobby)</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Umm… The venue for the opening ceremony is this way, right? It’s so wide here in the SS dome that I might get lost!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Then how about you don’t go running ahead, and quietly follow behind Anzu who actually has the map of the area remembered? Why do you always try to run ahead by yourself anyway?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Well, you see~ It’s because I trust you guys are following after me☆”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. But seriously, it’s crowded, so you shouldn’t be running, Akehoshi-kun.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “This is close to the reception area, after all. There’s a really long line~…</p><p>We’re supposedly not open to regular audience yet, but there’s a lot of people already.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. The people we see gathering here right now are celebs, everyone else in the business, and powerful figures of the country, I believe.</p><p>They’re the VIP guests, in other words… True to its nature as an industry-scale event, SS gathers some really famous faces.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah, TV personalities I’ve seen before, left and right… Ah, isn’t that Hokke’s Papa and Mama over there? Hokke, how about you greet them?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, I’ll do that later. There’s a crowd gathering around them, and yesterday… I spent the whole day with my parents, so I’ve run out of things to say.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “But there are media crews too?</p><p>Why don’t you show off in front of the camera that you’re the son of a popular idol and a huge actress, and get the VIP people to remember your face and name?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… But isn’t that conversely improper?</p><p>Autumn Live especially got me to realize that it’s natural to utilize anything worth using, including one’s parents, but…</p><p>I think my parents would stubbornly advertise me without me asking anyway.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hokke’s parents are a surprisingly doting pair, after all♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmph… I hate how they put up an act of treasuring their son at important moments as if to make me owe them, when usually they barely care.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Rebellious phase? …I guess we really are still brats, huh.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Oh look, that’s Saegusa-kun.

Don’t we need to greet Trickstar?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “No. We are engineering the situation so all attention will be on Eden.

It pains my heart to ignore those children though, just a little.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “H-Huh? Eden left!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “They just blatantly ignored us… It sorta hurts how it’s like we’re not even in their line of sight, when we look to them as our biggest rival.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I think they made the right choice, though~ Marketing-wise, and directing-wise, they don’t benefit from interacting with us.</p><p>Even with that shopping mall live, the news made it to the internet, but…</p><p>In the end, they only broadcast an abridged cut on TV.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “And even in news sites, we got cheap treatment, huh.</p><p>To the point that the helpers’―Ritsu and Sena-senpai’s―existences were totally written out.</p><p>What a shame. We put up a pretty good fight, though part of it is thanks to those two.</p><p>But it’s all treated like it never happened~ I guess that’s a given, if we think from the enemy’s side.</p><p>We could possibly be crushed at worst-case scenario back there―so it’s the closest thing to the best conclusion we could’ve had, I guess.</p><p>Even if the media didn’t properly report it… I’m sure there were people who turned into our fans among the audience at the scene.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup. We have Izumi-san and Ritsu-kun to thank. I think that was a real danger we were in back then, so they were huge help for being able to perform with us on improv.</p><p>But still. Despite those two from Knights helping us…</p><p>From an impartial standpoint, it ended with us ‘just barely alive’.</p><p>And I think Eden didn’t release even half of their true strength on that stage.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “And they don’t slack on cunnings on top of that strength. What a difficult opponent~ if only they’ll let their guard down a bit from their arrogance as the strongest unit.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… I suppose Eden is being thorough in making sure they’re not doing anything that would benefit us.</p><p>They were still scheming to swallow us in, back during Autumn Live.</p><p>Hence, they curried favors and threw baits at us that time… but I suppose this means they plan to have a serious match in SS.</p><p>Do what the enemy hates, without making anything go their way; that’s the principle of a war.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. Then if they’re so dead-set on ignoring us…</p><p>How about intruding in front of the camera while addressing them like besties? I bet they’ll hate that♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No, that might be a bad idea. They have more experience and advantage with television and media exposure in particular.</p><p>Look, most of the TV crews gathered here seem to be linked to the affiliation group CosPro belongs to.</p><p>If we pull something without a plan, they might do a crafty edit the moment they captured us on camera…</p><p>…and make us out into the bad guys. Into some unknown group persistently trying to get into a dispute with them, for one.</p><p>I’m not just saying this because I have a trauma regarding camera――</p><p>But really, those camera lenses are fearsome things. Live images can be distorted through edits and fabrications according to the enmity of another.</p><p>I think we should be careful while we’re in front of media crews under CosPro.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. However, we idols and the audience are not always separated by a screen.</p><p>We can come in contact with each other in this real life. And this time, with more people than ever had before…</p><p>So let’s make them all into our fans. That way, no matter how we were to be exaggerated and fabricated out of someone’s spite…</p><p>Our shine will reach everyone without diminish.</p><p>At least there’s no choice but to have faith and present every single audience before our eyes with songs and smiles, through dedication.</p><p>Don’t we all know since the start that it won’t be an easy fight, guys?</p><p>We’re going to do our best. No matter how hard a trial, even if the chance of victory is unbelievably slight―we can make a miracle happen, however many times.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yep; effort, friendship, victory. It’s gotten to be like a shounen manga♪</p><p>…Oops, let’s not stand around chatting.

Hyah~ I’m starting to get a little nervous too.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. In the opening ceremony, we only have to listen to speeches, so there’s nothing to be nervous for.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “R-Right. But they sure have it nice~ Eden will perform a song in the opening ceremony, won’t they? Look, it’s written in the program.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “They get to appeal to the audience first of all and flashily at that, yeah.</p><p>Opening a gap even before the fight… Well, that’s within expectations, though.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. Have you noticed, guys?</p><p>They’ve been playing Eden’s song at a low volume here… as if beating their singing voices into our eardrums and brains.</p><p>Eden really is using every trick. We need to appeal ourselves soon too, or we’ll just get swallowed and done in.</p><p>…I’d rather not depend on <em>that</em>, but the student council president is making his moves too, right?</p><p>It’s gotten me worried that I’ve only seen the effects of Eden’s strategies.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yeah, I heard he’s doing stuffs. All units of Yumenosaki are supposed to assist us, with the prez at the lead.</p><p>We won’t just let our opponents walk all over us.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Once you’ve got him as an ally, Eichi-senpai’s reliable, isn’t he~?</p><p>But nothing can happen if we as the real representatives make a shameful show of ourselves here, so let’s work to not waste their power of friendship!</p><p>Ah geez, I’ve gotten excited!

It feels like being brought to life.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu.

Say a word when it gets tough.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I know~ …Oh, Anzu-chan is waving at us there! So first up is to gather around for strategy meeting. SS is starting, finally~♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Anzu~! Sorry to keep you waiting~☆</p><p>Yeah, the opening ceremony was awesome! It was like so dazzling~ So much fancy special effects and all, they were like idols you see on TV!</p><p>Well, they <em>are</em> idols you see on TV, Eden!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Plus it was a new song that’s not in my data~ And they performed it so well, entertainingly and perfectly.</p><p>I wonder how many moves they have up their sleeves~ I think they are impenetrable, after all.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. You wish you had seen the ceremony too, Anzu? You could, right? Being a producer and all.</p><p>Huh, you had errands to do while they’re holding the opening ceremony? Thanks; our opponent is a powerful production agency, but… there’s nothing to fear when you’re on our side, Anzu.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. Going on lavishing each other with praises won’t get us anywhere, and it’s not the time to relax. I trust you guys have no problem immediately commencing action?”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/r5zQkFv.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “OK! Take the helm as always, Leader☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “All right. First, let us rehash the workings of the SS preliminaries in summary. They explained the rules during the opening ceremony, but there’s no loss in confirming them once again.</p><p>If we don’t make sure that we’re seeing eye to eye, we might end up taking different actions when problem emerges.</p><p>We are of one flesh as a unit, but we’re also separate individuals with our own ego.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. Rather than talking of individual ego and such, I wouldn’t mind if you do as you see fit, Hokuto.</p><p>You’re the leader, so use us like your own limbs.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. But if this is the method Hidaka-kun prefers, then shouldn’t we match him? I think he’s right that we should make sure we’re all working towards the same thing before the match starts.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh~ but I wanna start singing here and right now! I can’t control myself!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Geez, just shut up and listen. Anyway, as you all know, SS is the biggest idol festival in the country.</p><p>Plus, since idol culture is yet to be that popular outside the country, it might even be the biggest in the world.</p><p>This is from before we were born, but there used to be a national music program broadcast annually at the closing of the year, which got discontinued due to many reasons…</p><p>And formulated to succeed it was SS.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, we learned that in class. Apparently, the troubles from those times last to this day, influencing many parties and forcing them to change, right?</p><p>Like, Yumenosaki Academy was supposedly built to raise young male idols to be sent out for SS.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. I can’t go into details as it might turn into history class, but the content of SS slowly changes the more times it is held.</p><p>At first, like that national music program from the past…</p><p>Famous idols and artists were split into two camps, who then competed with each other.</p><p>It was a group battle, not an individual one. There was of course a winner between the camps, but the victor in terms of who’s chosen as the most excellent idol was vague.</p><p>But then matching the taste of the mass, who sought greater stimulation, and certain events bringing a fierce air within the entertainment industry…</p><p>The content changed that it became a contest to see who the most excellent idol of Japan is.</p><p>That brings us to present SS.</p><p>Even then, I’m just speaking of how SS has been until last year, as seeing Eden’s actions in the opening ceremony this year…</p><p>I think SS will likely find huge transformation once more.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah… Come to think of it, during the opening ceremony, Eden didn’t call this event SS, but Winter Live.</p><p>It’s like they’re trying to get the media to call it that as well.</p><p>Searching up social medias hit up quite a lot of results of people using the term Winter Live too…”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Huh. Summer Live, Autumn Live, and then Winter Live, huh…</p><p>SS is definitely more familiar to us.</p><p>And it’s easier to understand when you remember SS as the highest among the DreamFest ranks, above S1.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “We Yumenosaki kids might feel that way, but outsiders don’t know that.</p><p>On the other hand, CosPro held huge live performances across the country under the name Summer Live and Autumn Live.</p><p>After all of that, wouldn’t it conclude better when you call this Winter Live?”</p><h3 id="6-2">/ 6</h3><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hnn? But Summer Live was small-scale, wasn’t it~?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “CosPro matched the timing to send its idols to various events across the country during that period.</p><p>All of that are referred to as one Summer Live.</p><p>By calling SS Winter Live, they’re trying to make SS adhere to their game, I think.</p><p>Maybe by changing its name and dyeing it in their color, they mean to take it over?</p><p>The largest event in the idol industry, which Yumenosaki Academy has organized and raised to its current fame――</p><p>I’m sensing their intention to pluck it from the root and snatch it away.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “True. I heard CosPro plunders some Yumenosaki idols too.</p><p>It seems to be their specialty to snatch away what people have worked hard raising.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Well, CosPro hasn’t been around for long, so they probably have a hard time raising useful human resources…</p><p>So there’s no choice but steal for the meantime, right? It’s the basic in strategy wargames.</p><p>If we leave them be…</p><p>No, if Eden attains an undebatable and spectacular victory at the end of this, the whole industry will be swallowed into their wave.</p><p>The idol business will be dyed in a new color… and we’re supposed to be the ones specializing at revolution here.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I don’t think that’s a revolution~ That’s just invasion. We can’t let them get away with it easy.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nn~ But I think it’s not enough to just put up a struggle when attacked; we need to plan for what’s beyond too. Not that we have the leisure for that, now.</p><p>Let our guard down and we’ll be kicked out of the battlefield senseless.</p><p>We’re the only ones who can fight in SS as we’re the chosen representatives, so let’s all be prudent and take careful actions.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. Prudency is certainly needed. Yet, there’s no need to get fright and turn avoidant.</p><p>Compared to the DreamFests held almost daily in Yumenosaki, the rules of SS are kinder… looser is the word, I think.</p><p>It’s almost like DDD.</p><p>DDD was an event to choose the representatives of SS, but it probably was meant to be an exercise for SS too.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “It <em>was</em> Eichi-senpai’s idea~ So it’s a given that it would have multiple meanings.</p><p>If it’s the same as DDD, then is it a tournament where you’re finished if you lose?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Close. As participants of SS, we first have to pick our opponent and the place.</p><p>Or to be more specific… the one to pick will be our producer, Anzu.</p><p>Using the special device given at the start of SS, Anzu will get in touch with other idol producers, and work out the specifications of the match.</p><p>We can wage a match and vice versa.</p><p>But it’s not compulsory to accept. If you don’t feel like it, or think it won’t be beneficial to your strategy, you’re free to turn challengers down.</p><p>When a match is agreed to though, the SS staffs will direct us to a stage, and they’ll take us there with the crew vehicle.</p><p>We can suggest a location ourselves, but it’s more likely for them to decide it, by considering which stage will be most suitable.</p><p>Since the area for SS preliminaries spans almost the entire town, there’s high possibility we’ll be transported back and forth.</p><p>And if we don’t plan well, we might waste most of the allotted time on changing locations.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “So that’s going to the depend on our luck with the staffs.</p><p>Since Yumenosaki is the organizer of SS, if the staffs are the same, they might let us have the advantage.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, the SS Staff Association should be made of people of authority within the industry.</p><p>Although yes, the student council president is included, representing Yumenosaki.</p><p>Also, my parents. They might side with us, but in percentage more people there have been influenced in some way by CosPro.</p><p>Since we’re talking about the student council president here, he might use his wiles to make things easier for us, but…</p><p>He has a status to keep, so I doubt he can really have his way.</p><p>It’s better that we don’t expect to gain an advantage just because SS is a Yumenosaki event. Well, not that I ever expected it, to be honest.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Okay… But I’m glad. I’ve been a little concerned with this since I heard professionals participate in SS, but Hokke Papa doesn’t take part, huh?</p><p>He’s added to the staff association, after all. I like your Papa, so I prefer to not fight with him.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Heh, I would love to prevail over my father in a fair fight, on the other hand.</p><p>But SS is essentially a festival for young idols. You don’t really see those big-names… not that there’s zero, yeah.</p><p>Anyway. Once the opponent and the location is decided, we move. Then we perform a live battle to decide the winner and loser.</p><p>Live battle is just like the normal DreamFests we’ve become so familiar with.</p><p>Meaning, the audience will be the ones to score us with their lightsticks.</p><p>We and our opponent get to sing a song each, and the one with the higher score wins.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Just a song~? Then one battle will end in a flash, huh…?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. Idols participating in SS are many, after all.</p><p>If each battle takes time, then it may not end within today. That’s just how it is.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nn~ Then in the worst case, you might get to sing only a song before you’re dropped out from SS?</p><p>Even though you’ve put so much effort throughout the year just for this one day…?”</p><h3 id="7-2">/ 7</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, you don’t get to just go home after you lose. This is where SS differs from DDD.</p><p>The participants of SS are first-class idols; it’s a waste to send them home after singing just one song.</p><p>There’s the danger of their fans retiring along them.</p><p>So it’s not exactly a survival game common to Yumenosaki where you basically die if you lose.</p><p>We do a live battle, and the loser joins the winner’s camp.</p><p>Each of us SS idol participants is given something of a ‘national flag’―when we win, we get to take away our opponent’s flag.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah! You mean this flag? Wee… Look guys, the Trickstar logo is so cool☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s an important item so don’t treat it roughly… Anyway, so basically SS is about snatching flags.</p><p>You can snatch your opponent’s flag away when you win. Then the loser is given a flag of the winner’s and act as the winner’s vassal.</p><p>The vassal can still do live battles after that, snatching away their opponent’s flag when they win…</p><p>And give the flag they’re holding… the flag of their master’s to the opponent they won against.</p><p>So if all goes well, you won’t have to move much because the idols who became your vassals can win in your place and spread your reign.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “That’s the plan to take if we’re seeking the safest bet… It all ends when we lose, so we should take care in accepting a match.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh~? It’s boring to just wait! I wanna sing a bunch!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I know, I feel the same. But if you go against an opponent who already has many wins and vassals under their sleeves, you can gain all of that when you win.</p><p>So it is possible to do a turnabout at the final stages of the preliminaries if you’re smart about it.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “It really <em>is</em> like a strategy wargame… Conquer the lands around you and spread your domain; aim for unification of all the lands under your reign!-kind of thing.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. But well, even if their favorite idol loses and becomes a vassal, of course the fans will still support them, so…</p><p>The more vassals you have = the more fans supporting you.</p><p>That’s why just waiting in hope of a turnabout at the final stages might be hard.</p><p>We’ll see difficulties later if we don’t start strengthening our army manually by waging live battles and taking vassals in.</p><p>We’ll just find ourselves stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>That said, you can’t take back your flag after you lose, and there’s no room for cheating as they firmly keep track of match results.</p><p>Each battle that happens across the venue will decrease the number of standing powers.</p><p>Once the number of powers fall to eight―to eight idol groups, the preliminaries end.</p><p>Those eight groups are the ones to compete in the SS final stage.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Uh-huh… I see~ Nice rules they got there. It’s kinda like child’s play―chain tag, is it?</p><p>If, instead of being sent home, the idols still get to stand on stage as someone’s vassal after they lose――</p><p>Then a situation where the fans retire along their favorite idols can be avoided, too.</p><p>Our mission remains the same, then. Fight and win and repeat.</p><p>Of course strategies are still important, and we need to think about that too, but…</p><p>First, nothing will happen if we don’t give our all in each of the performance in front of us.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yup, that’s always the correct answer as an idol!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. Well, there’s no helping crafting strategies when nothing has started~ Let’s play it by ear for now while watching how things develop. Where should we start?</p><p>From the looks of it, we can do a live battle at Yumenosaki Academy’s premises―like the auditorium.</p><p>We have a lot of fans and acquaintances there, so I think we can expect a lot of votes.</p><p>Since we can suggest the location of the match… it might be better to suggest locations as close to Yumenosaki as possible.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Hmm~ well, it is our homebase.</p><p>But for our opponent-to-be, it would be an enemy territory where they have little chance of gaining satisfactory amount of votes…</p><p>So I bet few would accept to a match against us at such places.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right. Anyone would prefer to battle at a location advantageous to them.</p><p>While losing doesn’t kick you out completely, if you’re aiming to win SS, not a single loss is allowed.</p><p>Once you’re a vassal, you’re stuck with being a follower to the end.</p><p>And most likely, there isn’t a single person here who doesn’t care to win SS.</p><p>It’s the biggest idol festival in all of Japan. You’re practically promised a glorious future when you win.</p><p>We’re all desperate for that trophy.</p><p>That’s exactly why, I think, that at this beginning stage all participants will focus on watching how things develop as to avoid losing―leaving the situation stagnant because no one makes a move.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “But if you’re too scared of losing to move, you’re really going to hit a wall eventually… Hmm~… This is a tough decision.

Everyone, I believe you have been too influenced by Trickstar.</p><p>Let’s not mix up business and private life; the power of friendship can’t fill your stomach.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Nn~ Isn’t that just what you’re so set on believing?</p><p>Nagisa-kun and Jun-kun also seem to have that belief at differing vectors and depth, and I’m not exactly one to say either…</p><p>But let’s learn to have faith in other people a little more?</p><p>No matter how broken or impaired we are as human beings…</p><p>If it’s as idols, we can still connect with others and get approved.

That’ll be true despair; it’s the same as not being alive.</p><p>No matter how much we’ve accomplished as an idol… it’s all meaningless, hollow, without the interaction of love.</p><p>That will make us empty paper dolls who happen to look and move like human beings.</p><p>At the very least, I wasn’t born to this world to become such a sad creature.”</p><h3 id="9-2">/ 9</h3><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “…I understand what you mean to say.</p><p>But I don’t have the qualification to submit to such a humane delight.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Qualification?

But, I believe father had no child.</p><p>…He couldn’t love human beings made of blood and flesh, pursuing only idolizations.</p><p>…He even cut me off from the outside world so I wouldn’t develop any humanity.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Nn~ But Mr. Godfather… I’ll use that alias since even his name is taboo――</p><p>Anyway, even he couldn’t have been born with that personality, right?</p><p>Many experiences twisted and cracked his personality into what he became: a monster that’s considered a taboo of the entertainment business even to this day.</p><p>When that man who mustn’t be named was young… well, this isn’t a pretty way of putting it, but… he made a mistake, apparently.</p><p>The child born from the mistake had a child who then had a child… and what I learned was that it’s me.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Ah, father was quite old―so you’re not his direct child.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Apparently. But sins of the father and all that, most of his descendants lived and perished tragically.</p><p>My parents, probably pursued by a lifetime of debt, went ahead and deserted their baby at a certain facility.</p><p>And well, I got to experience a hellish childhood there.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ahh… So that’s where you developed that corrupt personality. Poor thing.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “It’s because I hate hearing that that I wasn’t too excited about telling this story…</p><p>I mean, think about it. Isn’t it embarrassing when people assume you turned into a villain due to your tragic upbringing?</p><p>My upbringing, and of course genes have nothing to do with it.</p><p>I <em>chose</em> to become a villain. No one forced me to it; I wished for what I’ve attained, and they’re mine alone.</p><p>…We’ve strayed from the topic. So Mr. Godfather wound up deceased, right?</p><p>I heard there was quite a mess with the matters of inheritance upon his death.</p><p>Either somebody hired a skilled private investigator, or Mr. Godfather left behind a will…</p><p>I was discovered as his great-grandchild, and inherited part of his properties.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Aah… So that’s how you end up with those companies you’re running, Ibara.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Well, the stock prices of the affiliation companies he ran crashed upon his death, you see.

Everyone was like you at the start, Ibara.</p><p>There are of course, exceptions like Nagisa-kun, who were fated to be an idol since he was born with the blessing of everything in the world by his side.</p><p>But most of us simply grew a personality, met with idols, fell in love with them and became an idol in the end.</p><p>Thinking, ‘<em>I want to be just like that</em>.’</p><p>In that sense, I think… you are just going to become an idol from now on.</p><p>So I’ll lend you a hand as your comrade, for that future of yours.

That said, it won’t look good to the media if we’re perceived to be doing nothing.</p><p>We’ll still need to challenge other opponents under the agency’s influence at intervals.</p><p>But I think this would allow us to advance to the final stage with the minimum amount of fights and danger.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Hmm… I still think we’re being petty―and blatantly cheating at that.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “It’s called being strategic, Your Royal Highness.

Don’t you think it demands a script, some acting and a setup?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Didn’t you criticize Trickstar and the entire Yumenosaki for dabbling in fixed games?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Ahaha, I apologize if it sounded like criticism!</p><p>But I never said I don’t dabble in it myself! I was just trying to get a point across with that hypocritical bunch~♪</p><p>I was portraying fixed games to be something bad and worthy of criticism… so they would grow hesitant to choose that method.</p><p>I believe Trickstar is having a tough time thanks to that.</p><p>Well, however hard they work, they’re likely to outspend their energy in the preliminaries and perish on their own.</p><p>SS participants are all first-class idols, not weak enemies that can be underestimated and easily defeated.</p><p>Even if they somehow made it work after multiple miracles, they wouldn’t have any stamina left to spend for the real stage.</p><p>They are no enemy to us Eden; I’m sure they’ll fall down with just a light kick.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…Do you really think those children are such easy opponents?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Admittedly, part of it is that I’m <em>hoping</em> they are.</p><p>If they insensitively throw our design out of order… we’ll have no choice but to prepare a destructive weapon despite the possible damage it may also do to us.</p><p>Personally, I’m praying it won’t have to come down to that.</p><p>‘That thing’ is practically a nuclear warhead… it will cause too many victims upon use, not to mention the everlasting effect.</p><p>Only, I believe the agency won’t hesitate to use it if needed…</p><p>So before that, I was hoping to discuss things with Subaru-san and get him to agree to surrender.</p><p>But either there hasn’t been a good time or he’s avoiding me, we haven’t been able to meet even though I called him to talk…</p><p>Ah geez~ maybe there’s really no avoiding bloodshed.”</p><h3 id="11-2">/ 11</h3><p>&gt; Shopping district (New Year)</p><p>&lt; SS prelims, hours after the startline &gt;</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/3pAjFGU.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hahi~… S-Sorry!

So there’s only enough time to rearrange your breathing, which is a few minutes.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha.

And we can’t not respond when they start cheering…</p><p>It’s not just simply changing locations; it’s a tour in an unfamiliar car that demands fanservice work at each stop.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes.

I had the twins personally train me like the training before DDD.</p><p>They shared with me the essentials of performance art, and how to attain positive evaluation from first-time audience.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. As expected, in SS we’ve performed in front of more audience who don’t know us than those who do.</p><p>Especially since we haven’t been able to battle even once anywhere near our homebase, Yumenosaki premises.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. No one here is whimsical enough to go out of their way to fight somewhere disadvantageous to them.</p><p>We need to be the one making the resolve to go out there to fight.</p><p>Thankfully we’ve pulled through with narrow victories, but… with the unending series of harsh battles, I’m feeling exhausted.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “I still have some slack~ I’ve been diligent with my on/off switch and resting when I must, after all.</p><p>Rather than stamina, I’m starting to find limit in my skills, so I’m feeling sorry for that.</p><p>I thought I’ve squeezed every drop of blood for my training, since Autumn Live,</p><p>but compared to other idols in SS, I’m the only one who seem to fall somewhere below average.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s not true.

The score each fan gives is slowly becoming higher.</p><p>It means we haven’t turned reckless due to exhaustion; in fact, we’re getting better and better.</p><p>Ehehe, that’s just like Trickstar, right! The harsher the adversary, the stronger we get~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Oh… you’ve turned energetic, Yuuki. Had enough rest, I suppose?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Right. But can I buy a hot cocoa from this vending machine before we get a move?</p><p>SS isn’t just exhausting to the body but also the brain, so I want more sugar intake.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Sure, I think I’ll also buy something warm for myself. Being outside for long is freezing me to the core.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Huh? What’s wrong, Akehoshi?

Deadly as a killing move…!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “He’s learned some unfortunate tricks, huh… Plus, Hokuto’s the type to cheaply use what he just learned for his own amusement… Well, acupressure is still within fine lines, though.</p><p>In SS, if you use a technique even once, the information will spread in no time and everyone will plan against you. So warm up your secrets and keep them hidden until the real stage.</p><p>Isn’t it a shounen manga cliche to overturn a pinch situation with a secret technique at the very last moment?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Mmn. But we’re out if we lose even once, so I can’t afford to be stingy.</p><p>We’ve survived so far only because we’ve continued to spend our all and bring our strengths past our limits.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Akehoshi?

Don’t take Anzu’s job away~”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Anzu is busy too. She’s a producer, not a manager.</p><p>I don’t think we should make her do everything.

Anzu-chan’s just like a real producer…♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “And what did you think she was all this time? …By the way, our fellow Yumenosaki idols who aren’t participating in SS are also doing many things over the city, huh?</p><p>They’re doing mini-lives and advertisements to support us Trickstar, in ways that don’t defy the rules of SS.</p><p>Even Knights and Akatsuki who were once our rivals and enemies…</p><p>They’re doing their best even though they’re not getting captured on TV; even though it doesn’t benefit them directly.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup. We can’t thank them enough, honestly… Not being able to fight within the premises of Yumenosaki was a handicap, but their support makes up for that. This whole town has become our homebase.</p><p>Thanks to all of that, we’ve had a relatively smooth sailing. I would even say we’re unstoppable!</p><p>Last year, we were nobodies――</p><p>But now, we’re fighting against strong, national-level opponents head-on. I can’t believe it; what if this all turns out to be a dream?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Don’t worry. I can assure you it’s not a dream. But if you’re satisfied here and throw all effort away, this moment here might evaporate like foam.</p><p>So that we can look back to SS as a good memory in the distant future, after we’ve become old men…</p><p>We’ve gotta set our souls aflame just a little longer, yeah?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup! It’s starting to get real fun, too~ The harder a game, the more fun it gets!</p><p>Plus, we’re fulfilling the promises we made to those idols we fought against during our ‘pilgrimage’ over the country―that is, to battle once more.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yeah, we were happy to see how far each other has grown, didn’t we――</p><p>Nah. We felt strong to know we have so many comrade-in-arms pursuing the same dream across Japan, didn’t we?</p><p>Oh man, being an idol is so fun~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu, I was afraid that you guys would start begging for a break, but… seeing you two, I guess that’s unneeded fear.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. Well, it’s probably the adrenaline making us forget our exhaustion, so watch out for your limits still, guys.</p><p>Don’t slack on self-care. Let’s all stand on the real stage at our best condition.</p><p>We probably only need one or two more victories to advance to the finals, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, I believe so. According to the rule, prelims is over when the remaining groups are eight, and…</p><p>From what I see, there are about 18 groups right now.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Huh. There were around 300 when we started, so the number’s been greatly reduced, eh?</p><p>It’s not really obvious though, since all of them stick around as vassals and continue to sing among us even after they lose.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Wow… It’s like we predicted but, it seems Eden is currently the top contender.</p><p>The amount of vassals they have is unbelievable. The flags we’ve stolen don’t compare.</p><p>Their vassals help spread the reign at rapid speed, flattening all other idols to the ground.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. The opponents we’ve fought against were all idols working at places unrelated to CosPro, after all.</p><p>They’re the opponents we’ve fought or costarred with once during our ‘pilgrimage’.</p><p>They were impressively charming, dignified… I feel lucky to compete against them.</p><p>Thanks to us winning fairly without hard feelings, their fans follow along them to support us too.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah. They were cheering us with varying dialects; the audience seat was practically chaos.</p><p>…We’ve managed to avoid fighting against CosPro idols so far. Good going~ just like in Anzu-chan’s plan.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm, but why do we have to avoid CosPro idols?</p><p>SS is a national broadcast. I don’t think they’ll be so crude as to dirty their hands under the watch of so many?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No, you see… Seeing the rules, we won’t benefit from fighting against CosPro idols in the prelims.</p><p>Even if we manage to turn one into our vassal, they’ll just lose on purpose to Eden or some other to switch side, which leaves us back where we started. Giving our all to fight them is a waste of stamina.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hm. I see. So to oppose CosPro, we need to keep challenging idols not influenced by them.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup. Some CosPro idols periodically wage a battle against us like an obvious assassination plot, but… Anzu-chan’s been doing a splendid job of rejecting them all.</p><p>There’s no point in fighting them, after all.</p><p>Of course, since we’ll gain experience, it’s not <em>absolutely</em> without merit, but…</p><p>What we need right now is victory―lots of it. Vassals who would really side with us.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. Before SS begun, I thought it’s gonna be a continuous clash against CosPro idols, but in truth, we can only opt to avoid them, huh…”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. No worries; we’re gonna clash against them on the finals, like it or not♪</p><p>For that, let’s just give it our all to what’s in front of us.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “…Subaru? Are you okay? You haven’t said a single word for a while now.</p><p>If the exhaustion really got to you, you can take it easy on the next stage and leave the hard work to us.</p><p>You’re a genius, so it might look as if you’ve got infinite amount of energy at your disposal, but I know…</p><p>That you really don’t.

Throughout SS preliminaries, we’ve only been transported to different parts of the town, so… we haven’t been able to stand here.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Don’t let your guard down just because we’re at home. If our opponent chose this location, it must be because they’re confident in their chance of victory.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right. Although, as the number of reigning idols becomes fewer, it’s becoming harder to wage matches too, locking us into a stalemate situation…</p><p>We’ve had a hard time deciding our next move, so in a way, this match is a lifesaver.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. Just a while ago, we even decided to get it over with and wage a match against Eden!</p><p>Well, they refused though, despite our hard-earned resolve to stake our lives.</p><p>And then, as if in exchange, a surviving CosPro idol accepted our challenge…</p><p>It’s like, we challenged the master but the disciple came out?

That means prelims will be done with, and we’ll be moving onto the finals.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Meaning even if this opponent become our vassal, Eden won’t have the chance to take them back, right?</p><p>We’ll get to stay on the winning side as time runs out… I think.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. Though it won’t be easy; it’s the greatest climax of the prelims.</p><p>I’m sure CosPro prefers their idol to be left around for the finals instead of us.</p><p>The fans who have been supporting the CosPro idols all over the city are gathering to Yumenosaki.</p><p>Location-wise, we’re right at home, but going by fanbase, we’re the one surrounded by enemy.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah. Especially since, according to Yumenosaki’s rules, the Auditorium is meant to prioritize the general audience instead of the students.</p><p>The seats are getting filled by CosPro fans.</p><p>Outdoor stages aside, the auditorium has ‘capacity’. If this continues and the entire audience seats are buried in CosPro supporters, we’ll have no chance of winning.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. It seems our enemy had a strategy ready so they could win even if they have to fight Trickstar in Yumenosaki.</p><p>CosPro really isn’t to be looked down upon.</p><p>Eden is enough of a threat on its own, but CosPro as a whole is the hottest, biggest power within the idol industry right now, despite its young age.</p><p>If we have only ourselves to depend on, we’ll just be putting up a futile fight and getting crushed.</p><p>However, we have allies on our side. Look, the influx of obvious CosPro supporters has stopped. I think we can put up a fight with this.</p><p>Most likely, the student council president or one of his people has changed up the rules to prevent the auditorium from being buried in CosPro people.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Uh, no. He can’t change rules that easily, you know… Just what’s up with your image of the boss of us stuco, Hokuto?</p><p>I think what this indicates is that we’ve obtained more outside fans. We’ve fought and weaved bonds with different idols of the country throughout the course of SS, remember?</p><p>They’ve gathered here for our sake. It’s not the prez using his authority to make things go well―we called in these fans.</p><p>We paved the path to the future with our own power.</p><p>Of course, prez and the others are likely working in the background too, helping to make sure the enemy won’t have their way.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. We can’t leave it all to other people, right? We have to take that glory for ourselves!</p><p>Even if, in the worst scenario, all the audience in the venue are under CosPro’s influence――</p><p>All we have to do is make them into our fans, right, guys?♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ohh, now Ukki’s gotten full of himself! All right! We can win with this…☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What? That doesn’t make sense. Well, strategy and all that stuff no longer matter once we’re on stage, so…</p><p>Our job is to sing and dance to our fill, for the sake of the people who came to watch.</p><p>Let’s do our best, guys. We’re going to win, and advance to the finals.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Sure! Let’s shine and sparkle at the throne of the idol business~☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha, to be honest, it’s such a cruel joke that even after all these harsh fights, we still have an even harsher final stage waiting, but…</p><p>Well, when you’ve come this far, you can’t help but want the trophy, yeah?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Right! We’re aiming for conquest! You know… I might have been pretty unassertive all this time, but I actually like being ‘first’♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Of course, since you’re Trickstar too, Ukki! All right, let’s all be the first stars of the idol industry together, guys~!

Pretty anticlimatic, to be honest.”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/QqukAA3.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. The audience seats being filled with mostly CosPro supporters was a source of worry, but…</p><p>I think there was an undeniable difference in skills between the opponent and us.</p><p>So this is just the expected resultーfeel free to think this way and puff out your chest proud. We’ve grown strong enough to render the enemy’s sly cunnings useless, and triumphed over them.</p><p>Let’s hold our heads high as we stand on this stage. We’re one of the few, chosen eight groups who have been permitted to participate in the SS final stage.</p><p>We were once nobodies, but let’s engrave Trickstar’s name here and now.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahh, it’s so comfy… (<em>snuggle</em>)♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Stop rolling around, Akehoshi. There are already people in the audience seats; don’t be showing something unsightly, you.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. In Akehoshi-kun’s case, don’t they find his pet-like motions to be cute?</p><p>I don’t know if it’s because he keeps a dog, but he acts like a dog sometimes♪”</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/X5gZEUy.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I love dogs~! Aah, I wish I could’ve brought Daikichi here too! I wanted him to see us shine!</p><p>Fufu. Daikichi and Mom were my support during those hard times, you know.

She loves herself, that girl.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hmm~? Then wouldn’t she make a great idol? Just kidding…♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “You’re right, though. Isara-kun, form a sibling unit with her. We’ll be your fans♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Stop with that, I got butterflies just imagining… I’m Trickstar already. <em>Yep</em>.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “You are, but… Anyway, it really is nice when your family comes to cheer you on, isn’t it? My mom’s been inconspicuously following us too…</p><p>Don’t you guys recall seeing a woman hiding behind a telephone pole sometimes?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Oh, so that was your mum, Makoto… She’s a pale-skinned beauty, huh~? Gotta admit, I thought she was a ghost. Got a bit of a scare back there.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Hmm? What’s up, Hokuto? You seem antsy… Looking for something?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, I just got curious too and wanted to find my family.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “? Hokke Papa and Mama are clearly in the official guest seats over there, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I know.</p><p>Ah, there she is… Grandma――she said she might not be able to come since her legs have been feeling weak, but…</p><p>I’m glad she’s come to support her grandson on his biggest stage.</p><p>Geh… the Masked Freak is sitting next to grandma… Right, they were acquainted or something?</p><p>Was he being considerate and brought Grandma here, like carrying her here?</p><p>Oh well. Akehoshi, perhaps you’re feeling lonely since your family haven’t shown up, but I’m sure they’re watching from somewhere, in front of the TV.</p><p>Just have faith in that. If you’re still lonely, know that we’re here with you. Is that not enough?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Nuh-huh, having you guys with me gives me a lot of courage… We can do anything; revolutions, miracles. I have faith in that, whatever happens.”</p><p>(Mom, Daikichi… Dad too, are you watching from the heavens?</p><p>Look at me. I’ve become an idol.)</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “…Hey, don’t you guys find it weird?</p><p>According to the program, the eight groups who survived for the final stage are supposed to rise up to the stage at the beginning――</p><p>Where we’re all supposed to introduce ourselves to the audience, and draw lots to decide who competes against who, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, the final stage is a classic knockout tournament―where the winners get to stay and the losers are dropped out of the battle.</p><p>There are three rounds, and if we pass all of them, we’re the winner.</p><p>I’m hoping it’s the final round that we get to fight Eden, but only God knows…</p><p>The bracket will be decided through fair drawing of lots, from now on.</p><p>…That’s what I heard. So why hasn’t any of the other idols shown up?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “…Huh? It’s getting dark in here.</p><p>I’ve got a bad feeling… S-Should we retreat to the stage wing for the time being?</p><p>But we’ll look kinda stupid… To leave the stage, we need to use the passageway that cuts through the audience seats, after all.</p><p>It’s gonna draw attention. Ugh, what’s up with this?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Isara-kun, sshh! I hear music and voice…?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ah, right… Hmm~ What’re they saying? Can you guys pick it up?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “T-They’re playing some video at the same time.

Why would we forget you?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “No, it’s what the voice… the announcer is saying. What… is this?</p><p>After all this time! After looking the other way for so long!

In the live show of Akehoshi-kun’s dad, who was a super idol of the time, a crazed fan was pushing themself through the crowd――</p><p>They tried to get upstage, but got into a dispute and fell on their own… Apparently, it hit a bad place and they died from that.</p><p>Your dad didn’t even push them or anything, Akehoshi-kun.</p><p>It was just an unfortunate accident… He wasn’t even charged for it. Wasn’t what you saw a misinformation from a news channel who jumped at the wrong conclusion too soon?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Maybe. But that was just the start of it.</p><p>They investigated my dad thoroughly after that… and many atrocities were brought to light. I don’t believe it even now, but…</p><p>Illegal donation and bribery. Physical abuse towards colleagues… With one evidence after another being brought to light, Dad was arrested. As a criminal.</p><p>The worst idol in history―that’s what the mass called him.”</p><h3 id="18">/ 18</h3><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “They held sense of ethics at higher value back then… so Dad was disparaged, blamed, until he hit rock bottom.</p><p>Some passionate fans who believed in him, in their disappointment, were even throwing themselves off heights…</p><p>The chaos just festered, no one could stop it anymore.</p><p>I still remember. The police officers breaking into our house and making a mess of it…</p><p>The telephone that kept ringing. Everyone we met giving us the cold shoulders.</p><p>That’s the wife and son of <em>that</em> Akehoshi, they said… looking at us like we’re demons. Speaking behind our backs, shattering our windows, throwing rotten eggs at us.</p><p>I was scared… Mom and Daikichi were my only allies.</p><p>During those times, romantic affairs of idols were also considered scandals, so…</p><p>Dad actually married Mom in secret.</p><p>But that’s also not approved, and the people who were in love with Dad…</p><p>…spoke especially foully of Mom and started reviling Dad. Calling him a traitor, a criminal―a scum.</p><p>In the end, Dad died in prison with practically no chance to explain himself. From severe illness.</p><p>He was always a frail person, and his mental condition tended to greatly affect his health.</p><p>I couldn’t meet him often in prison, but when I saw him for the last time, Dad was already getting colder… It was as though he aged overnight; he was an entirely different person.</p><p>Since that day, we started living in concealment. Trying not to stand out, so no one would recognize us…</p><p>But Mom and I could never bring ourselves to change our surnames.</p><p>I mean, if we do that, it feels like Dad would really disappear. The best idol in the world, to Mom and I…</p><p>Ever since Dad vanished into the darkness, Mom stopped smiling. So I tried my best to make her smile. Because I love her.</p><p>I didn’t know anything else, so I copied Dad… I smiled and danced with a smile. All by myself, in Dad’s place…</p><p>I stuck it out for a long, long time… and Mom finally started smiling every once in a while. She’s become reintegrated into society now.</p><p>Back then and now, she was always my beautiful, gentle mom.</p><p>When rumors about Dad became almost unsettlingly quiet…</p><p>We returned to our current house near Yumenosaki, which we deserted in escape back then.</p><p>We cleaned up little by little, restoring the wrecked rooms back to their original state…</p><p>…and despite Mom’s opposition, I enrolled to Yumenosaki to become an idol like Dad.</p><p>I wanted to be someone who shines radiantly, like he did.</p><p>No, maybe by doing that… I was actually hoping to revive my dad, who was as though erased by world.</p><p>I wanted everyone to know my favorite idol too. But because he’s not here anymore, in his place…</p><p>…I wanted to spread something shiny and precious to the whole world.</p><p>Because that was Dad’s wish, and it’s become my dream too.</p><p>I was so close, guys. It took a lot of time and hard work. Destroying something is very easy, but it’s incredibly difficult to put it back together. That applies to everything in the world―every single thing.</p><p>Even so, I waded through the process and took a new step. It didn’t start out easy, but then I met you guys… I met with Trickstar.</p><p>We caused lots of miracles, granted lots of dreams… Each new day was full of happiness.</p><p>I could aim for the brilliant future Dad couldn’t arrive at.</p><p>But then look. It took a single blow to destroy everything. Everything’s broken into smithereens and vanished into the darkness again.</p><p>If this is what’s waiting anyway… then maybe I shouldn’t have tried to become an idol.</p><p>I should’ve stayed curled up in an inconspicuous corner… along with an unsmiling Mom, staring at a blank screen on the TV.</p><p>Maybe just being able to do that, just being alive…</p><p>…is something ‘the son of a criminal’―someone who inherits the title of ‘the worst idol in history’―should be satisfied with.</p><p>Thanks to you guys, I was starting to believe that’s not the case, but…</p><p>I don’t have that confidence anymore.</p><p>Hokuto. Mao. Makoto. Anzu… I reached out my hand, and finally grasped it, you know?</p><p>I met with people who would hold my hands and laugh with me.</p><p>Do I have to let go of all that and go back to that lonely, dark place?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…</p><p>…I’ve decided.</p><p>Anzu. Sorry but I’m leaving Akehoshi to you. Yuuki, Isara. You two come with me.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Eh? No, uh, why? Start by explaining yourself! Contrary to your looks, you just take action as soon as you come up with something, huh~? Stop a bit to think, will ya?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Even if I don’t think, you guys will do it in my place, right? Anyway, just come with me… Please, it’s a plea of a lifetime.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “S-Sure, that’s fine, but… where are we going?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “To Eden’s place.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eh? Ehh!? Are you suspecting Eden to be behind that stream?</p><p>Are you… under the impression that they did this awful thing… and are thinking to give them a good punch?</p><p>That won’t solve anything! And I don’t think Eden is behind this!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Huh? Seriously? But Eden is the one who benefits from this fatal blow to our side, right?</p><p>Looking at the other participants for the final stage, Eden is definitely the one winning SS once we’re done away with.</p><p>Those other participants seem to be under CosPro’s influence, after all.</p><p>If they just eliminate us, they’ll be able to win without a sweat like what has been predetermined.</p><p>Among Eden, Saegusa especially has been trying to rile us up with his extreme comments. This really seems like something he would do.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I understand, but this entire scheme is too sloppy to be Saegusa-kun.</p><p>Even without doing something like this, Eden’s chance of victory was high to begin with.</p><p><img alt="SS" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/o7a8DUF.jpg"></p><p>We’re quite spent by the events of the prelims, so…</p><p>If according to the original plan, the final stage starts immediately after drawing lots, meaning we’d have to perform at our exhausted state, due to not getting any rest.</p><p>But now we’ve been given the time to rest, right?</p><p>A blitzkrieg would’ve got rid of us the easiest, so wasn’t it weird to pause for a streaming there?”</p><h3 id="19">/ 19</h3><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I think this wasn’t Saegusa-kun’s intention. He’s not <em>that</em> stupid…</p><p>Looking at the pattern in his actions so far, it’s unlikely he would choose this method.</p><p>We’ve suffered some due to that boy’s schemes.</p><p>As a result, most of the surviving participants for the final stage are related to CosPro one way or the other, making it practically their perfect victory.</p><p>I kept talking about causing miracles in one-in-a-million chance but honestly… even if we win, they’ll still profit greatly.</p><p>CosPro’s influence within the entertainment business would still be greatly strengthened.</p><p>They profit whether they win or lose; but if they can win, all the better―this is a pattern in Saegusa-kun’s strategies.</p><p>That boy’s an entrepreneur. He doesn’t try to cross burning bridges.</p><p>In my view, even his provocative gestures were only a strategy meant to scare his opponents into thinking that ‘he might really do it’.</p><p>He’s a snake that calmly manipulates others with his glib tongue. Careless frontal attacks aren’t like Saegusa-kun.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nn~… Then maybe he thinks it’s safer to crush us, since we’re the only unpredictable component here?</p><p>That’s why he went for the kill with that video, as an insurance or something.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No, that’s impossible. I also researched about the things they’re hiding, so we could oppose if he were to use this tactic against us.</p><p>Since he kept implicating that he had a firm grasp on our weakness――</p><p>I wanted us to be able to point a blade against their throat too.</p><p>After studying about Nagisa-san’s past that you heard from Eve during Autumn Live, Isara-kun…</p><p>I reeled in a bunch of info as well, until I found threatening secrets of them.</p><p>Saegusa-kun’s background, the matter of Sazanami-kun’s dad… It’s not a pretty tactic, so I’ve been keeping it secret from you guys.</p><p>But as for the case of Akehoshi-kun’s father… Maybe it was deliberately covered up, because at this day and age, it was hard to find much on him.</p><p>He seemed to have a deep relation with that godfather-like person mentioned in Eve’s story.</p><p>The supposedly discovered ‘crimes’ of Akehoshi-kun’s father all lead to that person.</p><p>That’s my conclusion upon looking at the information I’ve gathered in full.</p><p>I think that person was trying to make Akehoshi-kun’s father his successor.</p><p>Because your father was his favorite super idol… or simply, because that person was a fan.</p><p>He was a villain in every way possible, but I think he loved idols from the heart.</p><p>His methods were dirty, but it was thanks to him that the idol industry developed.</p><p>So, what I’m trying to say is, uhhh… if one were to allude to Akehoshi-kun’s dad…</p><p>It could also bring that person’s villainy, which they’ve worked so hard to cover up, to light.</p><p>And that could be harm to Eden at present, seeing as Nagisa-san used to be under that person’s shelter…</p><p>…and Saegusa-kun is possibly a successor to him.</p><p>Most people don’t dance that easily to what the media feeds them these days.</p><p>They’ll try to dig up what’s under to satisfy their curiosity, make their own conclusion, and crack wide open secrets of the past that were thrown into the dark pit.</p><p>Eden is the one hiding a successor and an adopted son of a criminal here, and an irrefutably terrible one at that: the Mr. Godfather.</p><p>They’ll be as deep in trouble as we are when their secrets are out.</p><p>So showing that video was really all pain and no gain for Eden.</p><p>They weren’t cornered enough to take risks. It’s all meaningless. They had no reason to evoke a plan that might bite back at them.</p><p>So our culprit isn’t Eden. They’re probably in as much panic right now.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. I see. All right; all the better then. We need to see Eden whatever it takes…</p><p>They might be able to help us.</p><p>No, maybe…we’ll be able to overcome this dilemma.</p><p>We might be able to stand up against this danger and our common enemy by joining hands as fellow idols.</p><p>If the members of Eden are idols just like us… then they can potentially become not our greatest adversary, but our strongest ally.</p><p>Let’s hurry. I’m confrontational apparently, so I can’t seem to negotiate with my opponents in peace, even in pretense.</p><p>I’ll need the help of Isara, who’s good at that kind of thing, and Yuuki, who probably holds the most information here.</p><p>Help me. Please. I need your strength.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Of course. I’ll do whatever I can do.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Same with me. I’ll place my faith and follow behind you, Hidaka-kun, like I’ve done so far.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Thank you. …Wait for us, Akehoshi. We’ll be back with good news.</p><p>We’ll make you into an idol. I’m a big fan of the idol you.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “That, and you’re a most precious friend and comrade to us!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “That’s right; we love you lots~ So believe and wait, yeah?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Guys… O-Okay. I don’t really get it, but I’ll be waiting with Anzu.</p><p>I want to believe in a future where I can sparkle radiantly with you guys.”</p><h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2><h3 id="1-4">/ 1</h3><p>&gt; SS Stage</p><p>&lt; Hours later.

Maybe I’ll even cause trouble for Tomoe Foundation…? But well, they’ll probably just take it as the profligate second son ducking back home after kicking up a stupid fuss, and look at me appalled.</p><p>I don’t really have anything to lose, so… I’ll show my dignity and sense of justice here.</p><p>I’m sorry, Jun-kun. You were finally able to stand on the stage of SS you’ve always dreamed of, but everything has gone to waste thanks to this superfluous scheme…</p><p>You must be disappointed, right? You can cry, okay?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Haa? Why’d that make you apologize, Ohii-san? Kindly explain? You always choose the strangest times to say sorry.</p><p>Yet when <em>I’m</em> all pissed off, you just keep on with that grin.</p><p>…’s fine, you know, Ohii-san. I’m a lucky guy.</p><p>Having the stupid old man’s dreams forced on me, I couldn’t accept my reality but held on with my everything anyway… Yet I couldn’t bud, only gathering soot…</p><p>I only ever brooded, but then you approached me like a dolt and told me ‘<em>You have a good voice!</em>’ and all that…</p><p>Then in your whim, you instructed me on a small lesson session, right?</p><p>Do you remember, Ohii-san? That time, I was shocked from the bottom of my heart, you know. In Reimei, non-Special Students are treated like mass produced cheap slaves.</p><p>But you spoke to me like it was natural. Then you came down at me, haughtily lectured me…</p><p>And I thought, <em>Oh, so I’m just a toy to fill up this noble kid’s free time</em>.</p><p>But then the next day you called me to talk, invited me to form a unit with you…</p><p>And I thought, <em>What the hell’s this guy saying? None of it makes sense, is he an idiot?</em></p><p>But also, I was happy. I felt honored; I was grateful. You were a ray of hope illuminating the dirty alleys I thought I inhabited.</p><p>It felt good just to be showered in your light, y’see. Plus, when I decided to hell with it and follow you, it somehow brought me to see this great view.</p><p>Look, Ohii-san. Look at the filled audience seats surrounding us… They’re all waiting for us to sing and dance, eyes sparkling in wait.</p><p>This is the scenery my old man once saw for a moment.

That’s right. It’s just as you say, Jun-kun.</p><p>Ahh… the dirty animal I picked up that day has grown so splendidly. You are worth the love and effort I poured into raising you; I feel rewarded for my hardships.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “I’ve got a bunch of things to say, but… don’t relax; put some spirit into it, okay? I’m still immature and you’re the one I rely on.</p><p>…I’m fuming, y’know, Ohii-san. My blood is boiling at those guys who set up this damn unnecessary scheme.</p><p>Does the show biz just stay like this no matter the era? They haven’t grown an inch since my old man’s days!

Man, no choice but to fix it myself then!</p><p>&lt;GODDAMN&gt;! Come at me if you’ve got anything to say! I won’t be done away with as easily as my old man!</p><p>My name might be hard to read, but carve it into your minds! I’m Sazanami Jun!</p><p>I’m the son of ‘that Sazanami’ that you guys once made into an accessory for the super idol! Well, I bet you don’t even remember!</p><p>Why don’t I fix things so you all will remember me for life, and never plot this kind of dumb scheme anymore~?!</p><p>You guys―you garbage and your damned ways―I’ll toss you all into the cesspool!

Ahh, I’m glad to meet you; I can finally eliminate the thing I’ve racked my brain over for so long!</p><p>Surely you don’t mind me squeezing every profit out of you ‘till you’re all bones!

Now I can never go against you guys for life.</p><p>But you know, guys? You really are amazing.

That’s what I think, from the bottom of my heart.</p><p>And then I just feel silly for being so afraid! I’m gonna sing with you guys too, in the third round!</p><p>I’m still a little scared, but even so! Please, let me sing!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “There’s no need to plea; you just have to wish for it.</p><p>It was the opposite back in DDD.

Good day.</p><p>Ah, maybe it’s more fitting to say ‘good evening’ now. It’s nighttime. The sky is clear and I’m sure you can see the stars in their prettiest.</p><p>But anyway… Hello. I’m Akehoshi Subaru.</p><p>I’m not used to speaking formally, so I apologize for any discourtesy in advance.</p><p>And also… I’m very sorry for today.</p><p>You all came here to see our performance, to see idols dancing and singing happily. I’m sure you’re confused, having been exposed to the backdoor dealings of the show biz and all that dark heavy stuff instead.</p><p>We’ll do something about it. It’ll be over soon. So please, listen to what I have to say. We have a gift of happy performances of your liking after this.</p><p>The video that played before the stage… That wasn’t fabrication. It was something put together from news reports that were really broadcast at the time.</p><p>My father was once called a super idol.</p><p>He was really popular… He was my pride and Mom’s; our most beloved person in the world. But he’s not here anymore.</p><p>He was branded a criminal by the world and died in prison without being cleared of that sin.</p><p>That’s a fact, and there is no changing the past anymore.</p><p>But I believe that the future can be changed.</p><p>So I will speak the truth: my father was falsely accused.</p><p>We have evidence. My best friend’s father―someone you all likely know as well―had secretly preserved records of that time.</p><p>He apparently submitted them to the police back then, but he was hushed up without them ever being investigated properly.</p><p>But he couldn’t stand that, and decided to keep those records safe.</p><p>The backup files he had at home were erased by someone who apparently snuck into the house. But the original records that he kept hidden just in case remain to this day.</p><p>I’ll submit them to the police once more. Also, the Tenshouin Zaibatsu and the Tomoe Foundation…</p><p>…will apparently help persuade the police to investigate the case properly, and make sure there is no unfairness at play.</p><p>It appears that stream was shown to you by a small part of the Cosmic Production, out of some intent… malicious ones.</p><p>We managed to find that out through the inside help of Eden, who also belongs to CosPro. The culprits have been kept in custody and should be in the middle of investigation right now.</p><p>I’m terribly sorry for the mess. Today might be difficult but maybe… by the start of a new year, all truths will come to light.</p><p>I do not know what the result will be. Maybe the records I submitted as proof were mistaken, and my father really committed those crimes.</p><p>And even if his accusations are finally cleared, he won’t come back… After all, my father and I are two different people. I ask that you don’t mistake that, at least.</p><p>Whether my father really turns out to be a wonderful super idol… or the opposite, a fearsome criminal… he’s still a separate individual from me.</p><p>I dreamed to be like my dad. I loved him. But I’m not his copy. I’ve lived until this day as myself, as Akehoshi Subaru.</p><p>Many life experiences and my meeting with my teammates brought me to the grand stage that is SS.</p><p>And there’s been nothing shameful in the life I’ve lived and the story I’ve weaved until today.</p><p>I have not committed crimes or any illegal actions. I gave it my all and worked hard, forming bonds with my surrounding people, piling one victory after another, until I finally arrived here.</p><p>If you can’t believe me. If you think I must’ve taken disgraceful methods because I’m the son of a criminal… then you can study me up as you like.</p><p>I’ll always prove my innocence. I won’t run away or hide.</p><p>So, please, if you can find it to forgive me… allow me to sing in front of you with a smile from the heart.</p><p>Please let me stay an idol.</p><p>Please.</p><p>…</p><p>…That’s the end of the dark and heavy talk.</p><p>Can I lighten up the mood with a song here?</p><p>Okay… Right. Thank you very much.</p><p>We’ll choose a fun song, at least, so it won’t be too uncomfortable to hear.</p><p>Please listen to our―Trickstar’s song!</p><p>♪<sub>♪</sub>♪】</p><h3 id="5-3">/ 5</h3><p><strong>Jun:</strong> 【♪<sub>♪</sub>♪】</p><p>(Yes!

Stay, stay!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ahaha, sorry! But I can’t wait! It’s the moment I’ve always dreamed for!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Fufu.

    <content><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://ensemble-stars.wikia.com/wiki/(Hungry_Morning)_Adonis_Otogari" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Otogari Adonis</a>’s, <a href="http://ensemble-stars.wikia.com/wiki/(Class_President%27s_Duties)_Hokuto_Hidaka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hidaka Hokuto</a>’s, and <a href="http://ensemble-stars.wikia.com/wiki/(Lonely_Junior)_Hajime_Shino" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shino Hajime</a>’s 3★ cards in Himemiya Touri’s “Scout with Story” set.</p><p><strong>Written by:</strong> Akira<br><strong>Timeline:</strong> Summer</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="otogari-adonis">Otogari Adonis</h2><h3 id="morning-tranquility">Morning Tranquility</h3><p><strong>&gt; Path to school</strong></p><p><img alt="Morning Tranquility" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/oHsshSf.jpg"></p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> (Hm.</p><p>The person walking in front of me… is that Anzu?</p><p>She’s quite early. I didn’t expect her to commute at the same time as me, who have morning practice in the Track and Field Club.</p><p>To sleep and wake up early is a necessary step to remain healthy.</p><p>But that mustn’t be it. She must be busy with the producer work. I heard that she also studies on her own initiative to catch up with the lectures.</p><p>That’s commendable of you, Anzu. Despite being so small… you’re always working hard everyday.</p><p>Poor thing. Her steps are unsteady, maybe due to her exhaustion. It’s hard to just stand and see. I wish I could rush to her side and support her, but…</p><p>I might surprise her if I suddenly call out to her from behind.</p><p>Apparently, I don’t have much of a presence. Anzu’s heart might stop if a giant like me suddenly towers her from behind.</p><p>As long as that possibility exists, I cannot call out to her.</p><p>But it bothers me. I cannot bring myself to leave her be.</p><p>I should stealthily follow after her. Maintain a close distance, so I can deal with anything that might happen, but also carefully, so she won’t notice me.</p><p>……</p><p>…I’m hungry.</p><p>My sisters do not eat in the morning. So I also do not cook breakfast.</p><p>I woke up a little late this morning, so I haven’t eaten anything, since I rushed out in a hurry.</p><p>Mmh. My stomach might growl any moment. This is not good; Anzu will notice me.</p><p>Hm? Anzu turned her head.</p><p>……</p><p>…Phew. I ended up hiding in my reflex. Good that there’s a stall at just the right place.</p><p>Anzu didn’t notice me, did she?</p><p>…Hm. This is a kebab stall. Perfect; I will have one as my breakfast.)</p><p>“Owner. Excuse me, give me a kebab.</p><p>I would be happy if you cut the meat thick.</p><p>…Hmm? No, I only need one portion. I do eat a lot, but I have a sports practice after this.</p><p>If I fill my stomach too much, I might throw up in the middle of my run.</p><p>And that will be unfortunate. I prefer what I ate to be processed into nutrition, without throwing it up.</p><p>I will eat meat, let my body absorb what it needs, so I can become stronger.</p><p>Mm? <em>‘I just wanted to know if you’re ordering for the young lady next to you too’</em>?</p><p>…Anzu. Since when did you get to my side? You lack presence, much more than I do.</p><p>So you noticed me tailing you. Ah yes, I <em>am</em> huge… so it seems I didn’t cover my tracks as well as I meant to. I will take care next time.</p><p>Yes, I thought I mustn’t surprise you…</p><p>So I hesitated to call out to you. Please believe when I say that I was not thinking anything untoward when I followed you.</p><p>Do you want some kebab?</p><p>Yes, sir. I know her. Give a kebab for her too.</p><p>Stuff in more meat. If that costs more, I will pay for it.</p><p>It’s alright, Anzu. It will be on me. It’s my apology for making you unsettled.</p><p>If you eat meat, become stronger, and cease to be scared of me… I will have less concerns when I approach you. I consider this an investment.</p><p>Does what I want to say translate properly?</p><p>Mm. There’s the kebab. It’s hot, so be careful, Anzu.</p><p>Eat kebab. The meat is yummy. (<em>munch</em>, <em>munch</em>)</p><p>Owner. That is wrong. We are not lovers.</p><p>I am an idol, and she is a producer. We are also classmates. Those are my relations with her.</p><p>Yes. Good if you understand. You make wonderful kebab.</p><p>Do you set up a stall here everyday? I will try to frequent here. This is good meat.</p><p>(<em>munch</em>)</p><p>What are you doing, Transfer student? Please do not suddenly touch the area around my lips. I almost ate your fingers alongside the kebab.</p><p>Mm. Right. I shouldn’t have spoken while eating. My mouth has gotten dirty, is it? So you wiped it with a handkerchief.</p><p>Thank you. …You don’t get scared easily, do you?</p><p>Maybe you are more tough than I thought you were. Next time, I will call out to you when I see you, without concerning over trivial matters.</p><p>Owner. She is not my older sister, nor is she my mother. Why are you sending her a heartwarming gaze, as if saying ‘<em>my, your son is such a handful’</em>?</p><p>I can’t comprehend. Still, this morning is more lively than usual.”</p><h2 id="hidaka-hokuto">Hidaka Hokuto</h2><h3 id="the-class-rep-and-the-homeroom-teacher">The Class Rep and The Homeroom Teacher</h3><p><strong>&gt; Infirmary</strong></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Excuse me.</p><p>Sagami-sensei. You weren’t in the faculty office, so I thought you might be here. Are you around?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Zzz, zz…♪ “</p><p><img alt="Class Rep &amp;amp;amp; Homeroom" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Nhy4qes.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “He’s sleeping in like it’s the most natural thing, this lazy teacher…</p><p>Hey, the infirmary beds are for sickly students who need rest, not a nest for good-for-nothing lazybones, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Zzz, zz…♪ “</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “A sleeping face like a baby’s. From the looks of it, he probably just had a night of drinking.</p><p>I will be disciplining myself so I won’t be an alcohol addict like you in the future, Sensei.</p><p>However, I prefer that you do your job as a proper teacher too, instead of teaching us what we shouldn’t strive to be.</p><p>Get up, Sagami-sensei. There’s something I need to report. I want to get this done with and return to Trickstar’s lesson.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Zzz, zzz, zz…♪ “</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Mmph. He won’t wake up even when I shake him and slap his cheeks.</p><p>…No other choice, then. I should give that technique father taught me a try.</p><p><em>Targeting your heart and bang!☆ Here to deliver you the hit song of the Super Idol, Sagami Jin!</em></p><p>♪ *~*♪ ~♪</p><p>♪ ~♪ ~♪</p><p><em>Let me show you a wonderful dream, Princess…</em> <em>♪</em> <em>(suggestive glance)”</em></p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “…What are you trying to do, Hocchan?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t call me Hocchan.</p><p>…<em>’Jin-kun’s treating his past like a dark history he wants to forget, so if you hum his songs from back then, he’ll listen to whatever you say just so you’ll stop.’</em> This is what father taught me.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “God, stop that, the shame’s pretty mortifying to me… You’ve grown into an amusing character lately, huh? Sensei doesn’t know if he should praise you for that.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Praise me so I’ll grow.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “What’re you being so proud about? Well, good for you, I guess…</p><p>(<em>yawn</em>) Ah, I slept well♪ ”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Who said you could? You’re still on duty, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “It’s fine, it’s fine. I put up a notice here that says call for Kunugi-sensei or Anzu if I’m asleep, along with their contact numbers.</p><p>Even if there’s an emergency, those two should deal with it.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “And you’re okay with that? You’re going to lose your license one of these days, honestly.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, I have enough savings to last me for the rest of my life, even if I were to spend it playing around… To be perfectly honest, losing the job won’t hurt me in anyway.</p><p>But your later years get really boring when you’re not working, so I’m working because I have no choice.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You’re not in your ‘later years’ yet. In fact, you’re at the age that’s often referred to as the prime working age, Sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Spare me the sermons.</p><p>All that aside, what’re you here for today…? You’re pretty much the model student for self-care, always keeping your health in check, so I doubt you’ll need anything in the infirmary.</p><p>What? Is it mental difficulties, adolescent concerns, one of those sort?</p><p>Spare me that. I know as a teacher I should be like, ‘_You’ll feel a lot better just opening up your worries to someone! Tell me anything_♪‘</p><p>But honestly, that kind of counseling burns out the listener too.</p><p>I do have qualification and experience as a counselor, so it’s not that I <em>can’t,</em> sure.</p><p>But whatever I say to fledgling idols like you, it’s all gonna come off as one of those condescending, anachronistic moral-lessons-from-my-boss often grumbled about in bars.</p><p>Your life belongs to you. Think for yourselves and set out your own path. Even the times you spend worrying and suffering are gonna be an experience you’ll treasure for life. Yep, yep.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Are you fleeing by saying whatever comes to mind? You don’t run out of methods to shirk from your duties, do you…</p><p>I didn’t come here for any counseling. There’s something I’d like to report, as a class rep.</p><p>The desks and chairs in our classroom, plus part of the lockers have gotten damaged due to age. If possible, please allocate some budget to replace them anew, or at least get them fixed.</p><p>Obviously I shouldn’t decide these things myself, so I’ve come to discuss them with you.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah~… This academy’s been around for a long time. Some things are gonna degrade.</p><p>The furnishings from back when I was in school’s still being used here and there.</p><p>But y’know, dealing with the documents are such a pain…</p><p>Just pretend nothing’s wrong and keep using those deteriorating furniture. Geez, you modern kids are so used to making expenditures for everything.</p><p>Aren’t old desks interesting, with all the scribbles from your alumni?</p><p>Feel the profoundness and transience in it.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No. Get them fixed. It shouldn’t be that much problem for you, Sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay, okay… I understand. It’s much more of a pain to keep arguing with you. You never move an inch from what you’ve decided.</p><p>Is that all you need? I’m gonna get another nap and deal with it when I wake up… so out you go. Good work as always, Class Rep.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. By the way, I have your statements recorded.</p><p>So there’s no use saying <em>‘So sooorry, I forgot!’</em> later. I can even win if you bring this to the court. My preparations are flawless.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Guh. Man, who’s this uncute brat…?</p><p>When you were little, you were a lovely baby who’d rub your squishy soft cheek against my face while pleading <em>‘Jin-kun, sing me a song♪</em> ‘”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “And back then you were the number one coolest super idol in the world, from every perspective.</p><p>…I <em>do</em> admire you, so please don’t show off your unimpressive sides too much.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Sure, sure. …Don’t ever become like me, Hocchan.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. I won’t be like you, and I can’t.</p><p>I will become a far more impressive idol than you, Super Idol Sagami Jin.”</p><h2 id="shino-hajime">Shino Hajime</h2><h3 id="cute-grievances">Cute Grievances</h3><p><strong>&gt; Garden Terrace</strong></p><p><img alt="Hajime" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/NQT72qS.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Akehoshi-senpai has been distant lately.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Okay, no point in telling us that, Haa-kun…?”</p><p><img alt="Ritsu &amp;amp;amp; Eichi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/igU2UEl.jpg"></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “How very interesting. Let us hear more, Hajime-kun.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Darn, Ecchan took the bait.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Yes… Um, you two know Akehoshi-senpai, I assume.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Of course.</p><p>He’s so cheeky and adorable, Subaru-kun… He was a truly unexpected dig. I wish I’d claimed him before anyone.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Aah, that noisy guy who often hangs around Maa-kun…?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Yes. So, umm, sometimes, I’d find myself together with Akehoshi-senpai for my campus part time jobs.</p><p>He’s so cool; always smiling, always so bright. He’s my aspiration.</p><p>I want to become just like Akehoshi-senpai… ♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “What about me? Don’t you admire me? Don’t you want to become like me?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Fufu. Of course, I’d love to become like you too, President~… ♪”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Haa-kun, there’s no need to agree to everything Ecchan says. You’re just inflating his ego.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Eh~ But this is really how I feel…♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Hajime-kun, how about I pour tea for us now? I got my hands on some good tea leaves~♪”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Ah, I left the sweets I made during lunch break in the refrigerator, so… if you’re going to prepare the tea, go get those too, Ecchan.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Eh~… Ritsu-kun, the sweets you make always have such grotesque shapes; I fear it’s going to ruin the elegant tea time feel we have going, so I’d rather not.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “I knew you’d say that, so I did my best to make them look normal. Stop mumbling and go get them already. We need snacks to go along with tea, right?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Sure, sure. They say one should take advantage of anything that stands, including their parents, but <em>you</em> should move on your own sometimes. You’re alive, and born into a healthy body.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Ugh~ I get where you’re coming from, but I can’t find the energy…”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Fufu. Are you lacking sleep again, Ritsu-senpai? You have bags under your eyes~”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Mn~ Lately I’ve been awake during the day…</p><p>It’s fine though, since when I need to get on stage, Secchan and Nacchan would cover these for me with makeup.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. Ritsu-kun, Sena-kun calls you Kuma-kun, doesn’t he? You’re Kuma-kun, so you have bags – <em>kuma</em> – under your eyes…♪” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Lame… Wow, I can’t believe we’re closing into summer and the sheer lameness of your joke managed to give me the chills.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Fufu, you love puns, don’t you, President? The way you always say such witty things impresses me, as I’m bad at talking…♪”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Remember what I said about praising Ecchan too much is just inflating his ego?</p><p>Anyway, back to topic. So that Akehoshi guy has been cold to you lately, is it, Haa-kun?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ah, no. It’s not that he’s been cold towards me.</p><p>But Akehoshi-senpai hasn’t been taking campus part time jobs lately, it seems. There’s been fewer and fewer chances for me to see him… I’m lonely.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Mn~ Trickstar’s been on the rise, so aren’t they just too busy for anything?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “They must be, huh…?</p><p>He’s become much, much harder to approach than he used to. Even when I encounter him on the hallway, it can be hard to bring myself to say hello.</p><p>Until a while ago, he would give me a hug whenever we met, but nowadays, he just seems so preoccupied…</p><p>That even if we get to chat sometimes, he’ll just exchange a few words with me then go away.</p><p>I know someone like me shouldn’t wish to keep Akehoshi-senpai all to myself. But I can’t hide that it makes me lonely… I’m being so selfish.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Nuh-huh. Haa-kun, you’re too meek, so you can be more selfish like that once in a while.</p><p>Good kids who doubtlessly listen to whatever they’re told are sometimes considered a bore, you know.</p><p>Maa-kun’s the same type as you…</p><p>He can be so overly docile that I try to get a rise out of him sometimes, but whatever I say, he just laughs it all off. It’s so worrying.</p><p>Almost makes me wonder if I don’t actually matter to him…</p><p>And he used to be so cute, too~ Calling me like “Ricchan, Ricchan♪” and seeing only me.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I’m back~♪</p><p>Fufu. It seems you two have a lot in mind, so I’ve prepared some herb tea to relieve your stress.</p><p>The have quite the unique aftertaste though, which may dampen the sweetness of your snacks, Ritsu-kun.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “It’s fine~ The quality of my sweets won’t get any less perfect just because of some tea Ecchan makes.</p><p>They can be eaten at any condition. They’re the masterpieces of a first-class patissiere – <em>me</em> ♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Sure, except you’re an idol and not a patissiere? Haven’t you been confusing the sort of character you are, recently?”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Shut up…</p><p>Anyway, Ecchan. You should give Haa-kun some kind of advice, too. Apparently my study in human psychology is lacking since I don’t understand.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. Then I’ll also share some of my wisdom.</p><p>If I remember correctly, Subaru-kun loves things that sparkle, doesn’t he?</p><p>How about decorating your uniform with colorful light bulbs from top to toe, then approach him while they shine? Surely he won’t be able to resist you.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “I see… That’s very helpful, President.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “No no, that’s just gonna make you look like a weirdo~…”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Fufu. But I meant it; it’s a lot of help. I realize now that just complaining that Akehoshi-senpai hasn’t been paying attention to me, complaining that I’m lonely, will get me nowhere.</p><p>The change needs to be from myself. I’ll have to work hard and appeal myself to him, so he would talk to me.</p><p>That’s what you wanted to say, right President…?♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “That’s absolutely right. You’re such a perceptive boy to be able to grasp the essence of things, Hajime-kun.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “No no. You’re <em>definitely</em> just making things up as you go, Ecchan. It’s written all over your face. You’re getting a kick out of this, even though Haa-kun is seriously troubled.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. But I can’t help being so pleased that my head refuses to work like usual…</p><p>After all, Hajime-kun just put his faith in us and revealed his worries.</p><p>It’s such an honor to know you’ve opened your heart to me.</p><p>If anything ever troubles you again in the future, feel free to rely on me.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “And on me. You’re always taking care of me, Haa-kun, and as your upperclassman in the Tea Club… as the older guy, your Onii-chan, I’m willing to look after you too.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Thank you very much. I’m very happy; I must be so blessed…♪</p><p>All right! I’ll work hard. First of all, the next time I see Akehoshi-senpai, I’ll immediately light up my lightstick!</p><p>Out of all my possessions, this gives off the most sparkle…☆”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Right, thanks to <em>a certain someone</em>, your effort’s gone off to a weird direction, but go for it anyway~…♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Yes, I also support you from the heart, Hajime-kun.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Thank you very much~! Ehehe, it’s like I’ve really gained reliable older brothers…♪”</p><hr><section class="footnotes"><ol><li>If I didn’t make it obvious enough, <em>kuma</em> can mean bags under eyes. <a href="#fnref1">↩</a></li></ol></section>]]></content>

And Shuuetsu’s surprisingly normal-sounding, you know.</p><p>I wish they’d have a more ominous name, like some evil organization! Genocide Academy, for example…☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “They may be enemy to us, but that doesn’t mean they’re evil.</p><p>We’re in their territory already. You don’t know who may be listening in, so keep both the volume of your voice <em>and</em> the content of your speech friendly.</p><p>Since we’re on the receiving side of their cordiality, we should be good and obedient.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yes yes, understood~♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. But there’s no helping feeling aggressive, right? I mean, this is where Adam goes to.</p><p>They’re like the brother unit to Eve, who pummeled us to the ground in Summer Live…</p><p>So it’s kind of unnerving.</p><p>I’d like to think we’ve grown through our hard work since then, but we were completely powerless against Eve in Summer Live.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. And Adam is definitely no weaker than Eve. I think we can’t avoid a struggle.</p><p>But hey, it’s still not SS, anyway.</p><p>Doesn’t matter that we lose; let’s just give it everything in our power.</p><p>It could serve as a good measure to see how far we’ve grown since that face-off with Eve.</p><p>And should we happen to win, that could become a revenge for how Summer Live turned out. Would be a nice motivation for SS at the end of the year. Though of course… we’re aiming for the win.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. It seems you guys are all motivated enough. I’m glad.</p><p>…Are you alright, though, Anzu? You seem to be constantly worn out recently.</p><p>We can greet our work partners by ourselves, if you want. You should have a nice rest at the hotel to heal the fatigue from the long journey.</p><p>The live itself is still a week from now, so forcing yourself too much from the get-go, only to be too tired for the real deal would be getting your priorities wrong.</p><p>If it gets too much, don’t push yourself further and just rest, Anzu.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha! Come to think of it, we’re all staying at a hotel for the week, aren’t we! It’s like a field trip♪</p><p>They said they prepared fancy rooms for us, so I’m looking forward to it!</p><p>Though we’ve had many interschool matches lately, this is the first we’re staying over for such a long period, isn’t it?</p><p>I’m excited~ Hey, let’s gather at night for pillow wars or poker☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. We’re here for a job, so we should reserve our energy. Rest at night, will ya? Getting proper sleep is also part of the job.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. We already had our fill sightseeing during the school field trip, anyway.</p><p>If necessary, we can prolong our stay and relax for a few days after the job.</p><p>In any case, we should only focus on the job in front of us for now.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “‘Kaay. if that’s decided, I wanna greet Adam quick. Can we enter the school grounds already?</p><p>From what I can see, there’s no one around and it’s dead silent… Maybe they’re on break?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It <em>is</em> Sunday, but you’re right that there’s not even a shadow. Yumenosaki is lively even during weekends, though.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. And there’s an increase on DreamFests lately, so even the weekends are festive.</p><p>Umm, from my prior research…</p><p>There are no student committees in Shuuetsu, and clubs are inactive and exist pretty much only in name.</p><p>The agency creates schedules for them, so jobs… live concerts and such unofficial activities are apparently impossible. So well, I guess their weekends would turn out like this.</p><p>Shuuetsu’s population probably don’t even commute to school during weekends.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hmm~ Weekends sound uneventful without club activities. I wonder what they do, then? Play with friends?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Umm… Apparently, Shuuetsu Academy houses only the most excellent of students from the affiliated schools… called the Special Students.</p><p>Even their weekends are probably filled with work, like proper celebs, I think?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ooh, what a grey-colored youth… I mean, it’s a good thing if they sell, sure.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “A school for only the top elites, was the word, after all. They’re of a completely different world~ I mean, I guess they do form a better picture of idols.</p><p>In truth, idols’ individual schedules often don’t mesh due to work…</p><p>So Yumenosaki is probably the nonsensical one for making clubs compulsory for its students.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hmm~ Even though we’re just at different schools, it feels like different countries.</p><p>I’m starting to worry that we won’t be able to talk normally with Adam, who have been raised in such an environment. What to do, what if they address us in alien language?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “That’s part of the thrill of traveling, yeah? Well, they’re human beings like us, I’m sure we can come to an understanding through words.</p><p>Anyway, there’s no point loitering around the front gate… let’s come inside.</p><p>Anzu, you have our partners’ contact, right? For now, tell them that we’ve arrived.</p><p>Since there’s no escort in sight, I don’t think we’re very welcomed… but we’re here for a fight, too. This treatment feels <em>just right</em>, yeah?”</p><hr><h2 id="foreign-land">Foreign Land</h2><h3 id="foreign-land-1">Foreign Land 1</h3><p><strong>&gt; Shuuetsu Academy Corridor</strong></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Uwaah, it’s spectacularly empty of people inside the building too… Ooi, anybody around?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eeek, it’s like humanity vanished away due to some accident. Despite being a brand new building, without anyone around, it’s like a ruins…</p><p>It feels like we’re in the middle of a test of courage… we’re already past the season for ghost stories, though.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Let’s see. Apparently, if we continue down this path, we’ll find Adam’s personal parlor. Let’s head there, first of all.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “What’s a personal parlor? Not a concept I’ve heard…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm, so they have a parlor for their exclusive use? Perhaps Adam is considered a bigshot, even within Shuuetsu?</p><p>When Adam and Eve combine, they become Eden, which is indeed the top idol unit of our age group.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Mmn, from what I’ve gathered, it’s one of the privileges Special Students hold.</p><p>Parlors and practice rooms, or such facilities and utilities within and out of the school, can be gained the sole rights to.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “For real? Some extravagant grants there. We always have a tough time just reserving rooms to practice.</p><p>Using the school currency to pay and going through all that procedure to borrow a lesson room…</p><p>Special Students in Shuuetsu are excused of such troubles, huh?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup. Plus, the non-Special Students from the affiliated schools are the one to maintain and look after the facilities.</p><p>Special Students use their time only for idol activities.</p><p>Eve’s Sazanami-kun told me that those who aren’t Special Students are no different from slaves.</p><p>Probably Special Students enjoy a royalty-like livelihood.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Hmm, so that means they’d all thrive to earn the title of Special Students, huh?</p><p>I guess that kind of class system is also one valid method…</p><p>…but since we emerged from the bottom of the chain too, it’s hard not to feel for those other students who get treated like slaves.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Still, we’re not here to reform Shuuetsu Academy’s ways. Even if some parts can be offending, we should refrain from criticizing them.</p><p>It is out of line for outsiders to denounce their ways as ‘weird’ or ‘abnormal’.</p><p>Students of Shuuetsu and Reimei enrolled here, agreeing to such a system.</p><p>If we win SS… perhaps Shuuetsu would realize the flaws in their methods, and rethink things through.</p><p>Until then, however, whatever we say would sound like nothing but an attack.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “If you ask me whether Yumenosaki does things 100% right, I’d cock my head to the side, too.</p><p>Some never do get used to its competitive society that’s based around the DreamFest system.</p><p>…Picking at the laws and stuff like this is probably a waste of time.</p><p>Adapting to the environment with an open mind and practicing to our hardest would be of more benefit, I guess.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. I suppose because we gathered and formed for the sake of revolution, we can’t help but concern ourselves with the mechanism of things.</p><p>Perhaps that’s somewhat crude, as idols.</p><p>To sing, dance, and make someone happy – that’s the sort of existence we should purely strive to be.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/CZoo7ey.jpg"></p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ooi~ Trickstar~♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Uwaah, that surprised me!? Oh hey, it’s Blue-senpai! What are you doing here?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Mmn, didn’t you hear?</p><p>It’s a job outside the school, so some of us from Yumenosaki, including supervising teachers, have been dispatched to be your support.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, come to think of it, a teacher will always tag along when we work outside the school, huh? Nuginugi-sensei supervised us for Starmine, too.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Kunugi-sensei will get angry if you call him ‘Nuginugi-sensei’…</p><p>Normally, only one teacher would supervise us, but you’ll be with us this time around, Aoba-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “That’s right~ It was Adam’s… or rather, Shuuetsu Academy’s proposition, that we can have as many willing students as we want to accompany you.</p><p>Apparently, the live next week might be of larger scale than expected.</p><p>Our school needs as many staffs on the scene as they can, and help was even enlisted through on-campus part time.</p><p>Adam’s Nagisa-kun and I are close as former <em>fine</em> members, see.</p><p>Plus, Trickstar did a lot for us during the Star Spirit Festival and stuff… I thought I’d go, if I can be of some use.</p><p>Of course, I’ll keep a low profile as to not trouble you. I’ll support you in any way I can, so please feel free to rely on me for anything.</p><p>Fushimi-kun of the current <em>fine</em>, too, has supposedly been tasked by Eichi-kun to come along.</p><p>He will apparently care for your livelihood during the stay.</p><p>Fushimi-kun should be managing your luggages in the inn you’ll be staying, as we speak.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Oh, so Yuzuru came too. Just him?</p><p>Pretty rare that he’s on a task without Himemiya… Well, there’s probably no rejecting the President’s plea, I guess.</p><p>Also – excuse me, but did you just say ‘inn’? I thought we’re supposed to be staying at a hotel? Is it just a figure of speech…?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ah… For some reason, Fushimi-kun was really against the idea, and moved your lodging destination to the inn that Eichi-kun’s family manages.</p><p>You didn’t hear about that, too?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. There are lots of changes, for some reason. What’s going on? Is the student council president up to no good, again?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ahaha. Eichi-kun’s been completely fitted into the image of a schemer, huh…</p><p>Since you’ll be up against Adam, I think there’ll be no end to it if you even put up your guard against Eichi-kun…</p><p>But still; you guys are the main actors, so feel free to act as you see fit.</p><p>Please show us a splendid miracle unique to you this time too… Trickstar♪”</p><h3 id="foreign-land-2">Foreign Land 2</h3><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “So anyway; what kind of event is it supposed to be?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? Blue-senpai, did you join for the ride without looking into the details?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “No, no. I did give the proposal a proper read first.</p><p>But the content of the proposal contradicted what I gathered from my personal exchange with Nagisa-kun.</p><p>On you Trickstar’s side… or more like, Anzu-chan’s proposal shapes it to be <em>Revenge for Summer Live!</em> and all…</p><p>Even the title of the proposal says <em>Revenge Match!</em>, and I was surprised at how psyched Anzu-chan was.</p><p>It felt more forthright… or even aggressive compared to her usual proposals.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. That’s how much of a bitter experience Summer Live was for Anzu, not just us…</p><p>I think it was both a turning point, and a tragedy we don’t wish to repeat.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It was a necessary experience. We have worked hard since our loss in Summer Live, taking it in as our nourishment.</p><p>So we wish to ascertain what we’ve gained since then, while measuring the difference between our abilities and Eden’s.</p><p>We have attended many interschool matches since then and produced results on our own right, but…</p><p>While I believe we have not grown into defeatists, Eden remains our greatest archenemy.</p><p>We wish to see what we are worth and prepare for SS, through this fight against Adam.</p><p>Since SS is at the end of year, we can still afford to adjust our direction with the little time left, should we find faults to fix, or points to improve.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. Hokke, you’ve somehow adopted a polite tone when speaking to Blue-senpai♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “He’s an upperclassman. The more I know him, the more I begin to think that there are sides of him worthy of respect.</p><p>For some reason, I can never bring myself to mind my manners towards the student council president or my club president, though…</p><p>Is it because they show more disdainful sides than respectable ones?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “This boy just said something savage with a straight face…</p><p>Fufu. You’re free to make fun of me, but this job is out of the school.</p><p>So please try to use polite language, as is proper, when you talk to Adam.</p><p>We’re in enemy territory, after all. And Adam is the boss here, so you won’t be making a good impression by acting rude.</p><p>Inciting hostility from the masters of the house is a horrible thing, you know~ It can be a thorn on your side.</p><p>Well, Nagisa-kun probably doesn’t mind, though. He’s a genius on the likes of Hiyori-kun, yet he doesn’t seem to hold much interest for societal norms.</p><p>If you leave him be, he’ll be off doing some bizarre thing all day long, so he’s a slippery child, in a sense.</p><p>If Hiyori-kun is like a noble, then Nagisa-kun is like an animal…</p><p>No, a monster.</p><p>I’d say he has a mentality closer to the Five Oddballs, rather than <em>fine</em>, in that they don’t follow the norms of human society, but remain needlessly powerful in spite of it.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh~ I wonder what he’s like? If he’s anything like the Five Oddballs, I think we can get along. I’m looking forward to see him~!</p><p>Today’s our scheduled first meeting, so I haven’t even spoken to him!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah, even within Adam, this Ran Nagisa person seems particularly secretive, or rather…</p><p>There’s not much reliable information on him released to the public, so I can’t grasp him.</p><p>Even his interviews sound like they’re scripted, and his social media accounts read like they’re ghostwritten…</p><p>It’s just what I feel though; I have no base for it.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Oi, oi. Don’t start forming prejudices on your head before you even meet the guy.</p><p>That sort of thing is visible, y’know? We’ve got to approach them with courtesy as work partners and show deference.</p><p>We’re guests this time, so we should refrain from simply storming as we please.</p><p>Anyway, I’m informed on the topic since I’m in the stuco.</p><p>There were quite lots of twists and turns before the proposal was finalized, see~ Seemed like it was given quite the overhaul.</p><p>It feels the content has changed a lot from what Anzu’s proposal originally meant to do.</p><p>At first, like what its title–<em>Revenge Match!</em>–implies, it was supposed to be a rematch with Eve, that we lost to in summer, y’know?</p><p>Like, <em>defeating our archenemy to advance forward</em>, kind of thing.</p><p>But there was some kind of political meddling and all, and somehow it’s decided we’ll fight against Adam, who’s Eve’s equal, instead.</p><p>They’re going to show up in SS as Eden anyway…</p><p>So I understand that we’ll have to face Adam eventually, not just Eve, but still.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. Eve and Adam combine to become Eden, right?</p><p>If we only know Eve, it means we haven’t seen more than half of their original shape, so I think a face-off against Adam is necessary.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Hnn~ From what I’ve read of the renewed proposal, whether it’s really a face-off or not is kind of up in the air too.</p><p>I sure hope we can have a straight-up one-on-one with Adam like we did Eve.”</p><h3 id="foreign-land-3">Foreign Land 3</h3><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Apparently, there’s going to be this thing called Autumn Live next week, in which idols of Shuuetsu and other affiliated schools will gather.</p><p>Trickstar will participate as a guest star there, is how the whole deal ends.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, by affiliated schools, does that mean Reimei…Eve will show up too?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Who knows? Depends on their schedule.</p><p>They’re in demand. I predict them to be busy, having more exposure on TV and other medias compared to Adam.</p><p>Anyway, this means we’re jumping into their large-scale event, much like Yumenosaki’s S1.</p><p>I don’t think it’s going to be a proper one-on-one.</p><p>Even in SS, there’s going to be idols from all over the country, so it can be a good practice…</p><p>…on how to act among many unknown people, I guess.</p><p>But it’s hard to say, if it can be the revenge Anzu greatly intended it to be.</p><p>I know it’s not all gonna be fruitless, but I’m still concerned over that part.</p><p>I didn’t exactly believe <em>everything</em> can line up with our interests or go as we wish it to be, y’know…</p><p>But somehow, it feels like we’re dancing on top of someone’s palm.</p><p>From what I’ve observed of his conduct in the student council, I think President’s not really satisfied, either.</p><p>If it’s not part of his scheme, then who twisted the proposal, and for what sake?</p><p>I can’t put it well, but I’m getting creeps… Am I just being a worrywart? Whaddya guys think?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “First, I’m curious on how Adam members are like! Meeting impressive guys can be inspiring! I’m excited~☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “What are you, a shounen manga protagonist? In the reality we live in, there are people we should never get involved with, you know.</p><p>It feels foolish to try to step on a landmine, so I’d like to keep away from people who smell like danger.</p><p>Admittedly, when I’m with you guys, troubles just keep coming one after another and it never leaves me bored.”</p><p><strong>&gt; Adam’s Personal Room</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/dvf9pGQ.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ooh…☆ So this is Adam’s personal parlor!</p><p>It’s spacious! Needlessly so! And the floors are sparkling clean! Awesome; do all Special Students get a whole room like this for no fee?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t put your hands all over their things, Akehoshi.</p><p>…Hmm, but I don’t see anyone around. Didn’t they say we’ll have a meeting in the parlor?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “So we were told… Aoba-senpai, can’t you get in touch with that Nagisa you’re friends with?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Mnn, I’ve been trying, but he hasn’t picked up.</p><p>I wonder what’s wrong… he couldn’t have wandered off somewhere and got hit by a car, could he?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “No no, we’re not talking about a toddler here.</p><p>…Huh? I think I hear something vibrate. Guys, don’t one of you have a call incoming?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, isn’t it Anzu? Look, Anzu’s breast pocket is vibrating!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. Pick it up, Anzu. It could be someone from Shuuetsu; they might explain this strange situation to us.</p><p>From what I’ve heard, you’ve met the two Adam members and conversed with them a few times – isn’t that right?</p><p>The rest of us haven’t found the timing to meet them face-to-face.</p><p>Hmm… Uh-huh… So this Saegusa guy from Adam called to summon us to Reimei Academy’s courtyard?</p><p>Apparently, he set off to welcome and escort us, but we ended up missing each other?</p><p>I see… Returning to the path we came from sounds like unnecessary trouble, but let’s all go back to the courtyard anyway.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh~? Can’t we just wait here? The meeting’s gonna be in this parlor, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Just start moving. We’re at an unknown territory; we shouldn’t act individually. It’s going to be tough to reunite when one of us is lost.”</p><h3 id="foreign-land-4">Foreign Land 4</h3><p><strong>&gt; Shuuetsu Academy</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/JJcgzA9.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hahii. It took us time, but we’re finally back at the courtyard.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Good that Shuuetsu’s not too big. In terms of land, it’s probably only around a third of Yumenosaki’s area.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It’s a school only for the chosen, anyway.</p><p>There’s probably no need for it to be big. The number of students should be comparatively few, if only Special Students are enrolled.</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Yes, there is no need for a spacious lot if the population is few.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha, we went back and forth, huh~? I think it’s rare for us to be the ones played around like this.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Oh, there’s a large vehicle on the courtyard that didn’t look to be here back then.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Mnn? What is that? It looks weirdly bulky… a military vehicle?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, look! Someone’s standing near the vehicle! Isn’t he from Adam~? His photo was on the documents handed to us before!”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/rF02LOE.jpg"></p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Sirs! Thank you for coming all the way here! Welcome to Shuuetsu Academy…☆</p><p>Allow me to show my appreciation for your long and tiring journey! I am called Saegusa Ibara, and I belong to Adam! It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance!</p><p>Salute~☆</p><p>It must have been a tiring trip from the station to here, yes?</p><p>This school was built in a remote area to follow its vision of ‘a quiet studying environment away from the city’s bustling’, after all!</p><p>So thinking to play a good host, I brought a car to pick you up at the station, in order to escort you all the way here, but…</p><p>It appears we ended up missing each other. Apologies for the inconvenience.</p><p>Allow me to offer you my deepest regrets! Aah, what an unsightly failure!</p><p>To let the great members of Trickstar wait in vain — it is my lifetime mistake! I’d crawl under a rock, if I can!</p><p>I hope they don’t misunderstand my intents… We welcome the members of Trickstar oh so very much!</p><p>I’m truly happy! How like a dream! I have been thrilled to meet you…☆</p><p>I’ve heard a lot about you! I feel my heart dancing with joy, to have you participate in our Autumn Live this time around! I must be the most fortunate man on earth!</p><p>Just your presence excites me! May I shake your hand? I’m a huge fan!</p><p>What an honor to be able to costar with you! Please, I am in your care for the job…!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (Uwoh… He’s, how should I put this, a lot more forward than I thought.</p><p>They’re supposed to stand at the top of our age group with Eve, so I imagined them to be more arrogant.</p><p>But he’s being strangely humble, and he keeps bowing his head down for no reason.)</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Aah, you must be Trickstar’s leader, Hidaka Hokuto-san!</p><p>Always cool and collected, the dependable leader! However, he hides within himself enormous, boiling passion!</p><p>I’ve admired you! It’s such an honor to come face to face with you!</p><p>Allow me to greet you in no particular order, then! The astute producer Yumenosaki Academy boasts of: Anzu-san! I am in your care!</p><p>Isara Mao-san! An all-rounder capable of any feat! The indispensable unsung hero of Trickstar!</p><p>Yuuki Makoto-san: his peerless beauty once ruled over the world of child modeling! Akehoshi Subaru-san: a memento left by the super genius of legend!</p><p>Your unique shines multiply when gathered into one, gleaming as the nova of the idol industry!</p><p>Gentlemen of Trickstar! I have waited so long for the day we can finally meet…☆”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “W-Wow, he certainly goes all out with the flattery… Umm, Saegusa-kun, was it? Is Nagisa-kun not with you?</p><p>I couldn’t get in touch with him, so I’m a little worried.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Hmm… Hu~h…</p><p>Ah, you must be the former <em>fine</em> Aoba Tsumugi-san?</p><p>It must be either God’s blessing or the Devil’s whim, that I could happen upon you in this place!</p><p>Fufu. His Excellency<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, having forgotten our schedule, was immersing himself in his hobbies, so I took a detour and picked him up.</p><p>He should be on the trunk of this vehicle, reading a book.</p><p>Only, His Excellency was doing some excavation when I picked him up, you see. I believe he would not be a pleasant sight with the mud covering him…</p><p>I shall have him cleaned up and his clothes changed first, so he can greet you all later.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “His Excellency…?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Ah, it is Ran Nagisa-san that I meant! I cannot help referring to him as such~ How embarrassing!</p><p>I had been somewhere similar to a military camp, you see, and it shaped my speech!</p><p>I apologize if it leaves you uncomfortable! I shall make adjustments should I rub you the wrong way, so I ask for your forgiveness on the matter!</p><p>In any case! I suppose I’ve said this multiple times, but: Welcome, to our Shuuetsu Academy! We are greatly pleased by your presence, gentlemen of Trickstar!</p><p>Let us join hands to enliven the coming Autumn Live!</p><p>I believe that we can realize a dream-like concert, if it is with you all!</p><p>If you would feel the same way, then I cannot be happier! Ahaha☆”</p><h3 id="foreign-land-5">Foreign Land 5</h3><p><strong>&gt; Shuuetsu Academy Corridor</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Dwn6cdL.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Sorry for the wait~! I changed into practice clothes!</p><p>It’s so nice of you guys to even prepare these~! Did Anzu design them? It has a similar feel to the ones we usually wear in Yumenosaki~♪”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Ahaha. As we will only do introductions for today, there is no reason to change your clothes, but…</p><p>As expected, it fits you handsomely! Handsome men certainly make everything they wear look charming☆”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “<em>Handsome men</em>, he said… Well, you change too, Barry! Let’s perform a song during our introductions, to test each other’s’ strengths. Eve did the same, you know?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “So ‘Barry’ must refer to me. I am happy to be honored with a nickname!</p><p>I suppose that is your very own art of communication, Akehoshi-san; what a learning experience!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hmm~ He’ll praise me for anything I say, but won’t actually <em>listen</em>, I feel…</p><p>We’re going to perform together in Autumn Live, right? Let’s get along?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Of course. While a job can be accomplished without getting along, we did invite you here for that reason, among many others.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…What do you mean?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, Akehoshi-ku~n. Don’t rush off by yourself. It’s your bad habit.</p><p>We’re not used to Shuuetsu Academy yet, so we might get lost if we move separately.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/SiRN1ie.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. We should avoid being isolated in an enemy territory.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “<em>Enemy</em>… You are surprisingly a confrontational group, aren’t you~?</p><p>I’ve done reasonable research on Trickstar’s activities so far, but…</p><p>As of late, you have been traveling to many nooks and corners of the country and challenging famous idols everywhere, yes?</p><p>You seem to be producing great results, and your name is becoming more heard.</p><p>Only, fighting takes up a lot of resources, so doing too much of that can be life-shortening.</p><p>The saying does go that <em>if you want peace, prepare for war</em>,</p><p>but I believe we should avoid conflict, for as long as it is avoidable. I hope to get along with you all.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm, that sounds different from what Eve told us.</p><p>I imagined Adam to be a more masculine unit like its name, the two of you being more ferocious and aggressive.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Ahaha. Well, modern men <em>are</em> tame~ Dulled fangs, and all.</p><p>As part of our image strategy, we are indeed sometimes demanded to act out the society’s image of masculinity.</p><p>While I’ve had no problems, His Excellency appears to have a hard time acting this out. He is a rather introverted person who dislikes conflict, you see.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “His Excellency refers to that Nagisa person, right…? He hasn’t shown himself, has he? We’d like to finish introductions today, at least.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Aah, I tossed him into the bath, so he will not be coming out for a while.</p><p>He was really covered in mud, after all~ I think cleaning up all the dirt would take some time.</p><p>Aoba-san, was it… That friend is attending to him, so I’d like to believe he would not wander off again.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Does he vanish often, that person?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Indeed. His Excellency does things as he pleases~ He is an adept man, so his quirks are excused for the most part.</p><p>But there is no end to my worries as his partner, honestly.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. Now we know where Aoba-senpai is, but where did Isara and Anzu disappear to? I haven’t seen them?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah… They took the chance to make a visit to the office to hand over papers and stuff.</p><p>I thought no one’s around during weekend, but the office’s properly functioning, huh?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Yes. Special Students do as they please, but those supporting from beneath work all year long, you see.</p><p>Quietly, in the shadows, as to not stand out.</p><p>Ah, but of course <em>all year long</em> is a figure of speech… In reality, they get proper rest through shifts, and their working abides by labor law.</p><p>In any case, since there is nothing particular to do while we wait, allow me to guide you for a tour. There’s no benefit to reap from loitering aimlessly around the corridor.</p><p>We can contact Isara-san and others through phone later when it’s time to regroup.</p><p>Over here, please. Certain areas are inaccessible with my level of authority, but feel free to request anywhere you wish to see.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? Isn’t Adam the number one bigshot in Shuuetsu? So even there are places you can’t enter~?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Ahaha. There are logical problems with entering other people’s personal rooms, yes.</p><p>We are just students, so we are not exactly the <em>number one big shot</em>, per se.</p><p>We can’t defy what the higher-ups tell us.</p><p>We, of affiliated schools including Shuuetsu, are especially under the strong influence of our agency… Often they’d make unreasonable demands, and we’d have a hectic time because of it.”</p><h3 id="foreign-land-6">Foreign Land 6</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right, Tomoe-senpai often rambled about his agency.</p><p>He has a devil-may-care attitude, but he seems to follow what his agency tells him, despite reluctance.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “That’s idol-like, in a sense.</p><p>In Yumenosaki, the school itself acts the agency, or at least functioning as one and the same, so it’s not a topic that’s often brought up.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “It appears so. Yumenosaki Academy has been restoring its reputation in recent years, but…</p><p>They have their hands too full to care for other affairs.</p><p>With training a lone producer as a test case, for one. Yumenosaki is falling behind a decade on these matters.</p><p>In any case. We students of Shuuetsu, Reimei, and other affiliate schools all, without exception, belong to an agency. We are trained and managed by them.</p><p>That agency is called Cosmic Production, shortened CosPro. But well, most of us usually just call it ‘the agency’.</p><p>Students of other schools can enter our agency as well, provided they go through the necessary procedures.</p><p>If Yumenosaki’s ways stop agreeing with you, do feel free to switch over to this side.</p><p>It should not contradict your school’s laws or its rules, yes?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah. While Yumenosaki does what an agency does for its students, we’re not affiliated with any actual agency on paper.</p><p>Among the people we know, there’s one like Narukami-kun who belongs to a modeling agency too.</p><p>Personally, entering an agency on top of the unit, club, and committee I belong to right now sounds like a huge deal and a tangle of personal connections.</p><p>And for now, we haven’t been disadvantaged in any way in our activities as idols by only being under Yumenosaki Academy’s wings.</p><p>When we work under an agency, we might have to do things that don’t suit our principles, so I’m not too fond of it…</p><p>Our current position is much more comfortable. It’ll tire me out if everything gets connected to work.</p><p>Of course, if that’s what the others wish, I won’t object. There’s wisdom to be gained from entering an agency, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. You once worked under an agency, didn’t you, Yuuki?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “During my child modeling days, yeah. It’s normal for idols and models; Yumenosaki students are the exceptions here.</p><p>Of course, there are those who work in small scale, either alone or centered around an amateur producer.</p><p>But entering a huge agency makes many things a lot easier.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Indeed. …Speaking of which, you have all been put under temporary contract with CosPro, just in case.</p><p>It’s only for the period of Autumn Live’s preparation…</p><p>…and as Special Students. The procedures will go smoother that way.</p><p>Of course, you are free to leave once Autumn Live is over.</p><p>These are your temporary licenses… proof that you now hold the position I just spoke of.</p><p>You will be fined if you lose it, so please, take care not to.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ooh… What’s this? Smartphone?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Yes. They are computer tablets distributed to all students belonging to our agency.</p><p>Certain facilities cannot be used without checking in using it, so please have it on you at all times, if possible.</p><p>I will hand one over to Isara-san as well as Anzu-san later. I’m afraid we can’t provide one for support members like Aoba-san, however.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ooh… I love this kind of stuff.</p><p>Mm-hmm… So will the door open if we manifest this confirmation screen here and hold it over a facility’s panel? Ahaha, it’s like a game♪”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Those tablets are for guest use, so they do not have many utilities, unfortunately.</p><p>…You won’t find much even if you try to research about us using them.</p><p>But of course, if you would become one of us – if you would officially enter our agency, we will prepare to make every information accessible.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Nope, this is enough for a short-term contract.</p><p>Wow, I can just keep fiddling with these types of devices forever…</p><p>Look guys, there’s an app that’ll score your selfie from an idol standpoint. What sort of algorithm do you think they use?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Mmn~ I don’t get this stuff, so I’ll leave mine to Hokke.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, there are doors that have to be opened with these tablets, so carry yours on your own. You might find difficulties without it.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Right… We were able to enter Adam’s personal parlor without this, though.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Ahaha. His Excellency finds confirmation devices and such a hassle, so that place is always open.</p><p>Thanks to that, we cannot afford to leave anything important or personal over there, so it can be troubling.</p><p>But well, that is fine. His Excellency is a special existence. As long as he would display the power and bearings befitting of that, I simply need to support him from the shadow <em>and</em> in the light.</p><p>Just by doing that, we will have no enemy in the world. His Excellency is our ultimate weapon.”</p><h2 id="villain">Villain</h2><h3 id="villain-1">Villain 1</h3><p><strong>&gt; Shuuetsu Academy Corridor</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/zm4nCXF.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> (Geez… The procedural took quite a while.</p><p>It’s just somehow different from what we heard.

You look unwell, Isara.</p><p>What did you do to our comrade, former <em>fine</em>?”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I sense hostility in your tone, Hokke Mask-kun.</p><p>…No, maybe I should call you Hidaka Hokuto-kun.

In other words, he’s something that can be replaced.</p><p>…Adults see no worth in such an asset.</p><p>…After all, they can get their hands on one with reasonable cost, without any need for unearthing.</p><p>…He’s nothing but a handy tool that’s only appreciated within the world of children, like a school environment.</p><p>…Any Special Student enrolled to Shuuetsu can replace him.</p><p>…He’s worthless here. No — he’s a dull existence that can be traded for cheap.</p><p>…In fact, I found it strange. Why are you treating the likes of this boy as your comrade?</p><p>…Because he would cover for what you lack? Because he’s a friend you know well?</p><p>…Maybe because he’s weak.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What are you mumbling about? Answer me, what did you do to Isara!?”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I didn’t do anything. Don’t look at me like you’re looking at a villain.</p><p>…He’ll eventually find himself unable to catch up with you guys and get left behind, anyway, before fading away completely.</p><p>…He’ll scorch from the frictional heat and break down on his own, leaving only dust behind as he scatters as flowers do.</p><p>…But you don’t need to feel sad. There are many replacements for him.</p><p>…You don’t need to adhere to the illumination of a flashlight who mistook himself for a star.</p><p>…….</p><p>…Huh? No one is reacting. Was my wording too difficult?</p><p>…I’m hopeless. It seems I can’t convey my feelings properly without someone to translate for me.</p><p>…Misunderstanding births dispute.

The Trickstar members are the main actors this time around; they’re free to forget about me.</p><p>After I finished taking care of Nagisa-kun, he left me behind, and I just <em>had</em> to get trapped inside the bath…</p><p>I couldn’t move a single step out of there.</p><p>It seems facilities within Shuuetsu need a special computer tablet to enter and leave…</p><p>So I was completely powerless because of that whole system.</p><p>By the time I was finally saved by a patrolling security officer, it’s already so late into the night.</p><p>Uukh… I let my guard down because it’s been so peaceful recently, but that was such a huge misfortune.”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Fufu. I suppose you couldn’t use your phone to call for help inside the bath.</p><p>A splendid blunder, indeed.</p><p>From my observation, being a handful child appears to be a prerequisite to be part of past _fine_♪”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Eeeh!? W-What a sharp tongue…! Maybe it’s Eichi-kun’s influence~?</p><p>And… Right. I should’ve called for help using my phone… I was able to get out to the changing room, so I wonder why I didn’t think of that.</p><p>I’m so hopeless~ I break into panic easily.</p><p>There should’ve been many other methods too, like shouting in a loud voice for Trickstar, who were in the same building, to help me.”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Yes, but, the members of Trickstar were indeed acting weird today.</p><p>If they were their usual selves, they would have looked for you out of worry, Aoba-sama, when they realized you weren’t here.</p><p>They seemed rather distracted, and quickly went to sleep after taking a bath and finishing their meal.</p><p>Here I had my sleeves rolled up and all, prepared to knock them down were I to find them having a pillow fight.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ah, it’s pretty late, after all… I think it’s normal to be fatigued from the long trip and fall fast asleep.</p><p>Anyway, are the members of Trickstar in a different room from us support members?”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Indeed. Trickstar is close-knitted, so I arranged all of them to be in the same room, thinking it might be for the better.</p><p>The rest of us support members are split into groups and spread among the rest of the rooms.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Well, Anzu-chan obviously can’t be in the same room as them since she’s a girl…</p><p>But is it really right for the rest of us to stay at this expensive-looking room too?”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Of course. The President has reserved this inn for us out of benevolence, so please, do not let the service cost concern you.</p><p>The staffs of this inn are also free of the enemy’s influence and worthy of our trust.</p><p>I was worried of Ibara’s involvement… so I had everything checked from head to toe, even causing some disputes along the way.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Umm, <em>enemy</em>, he said… You use some violent wordings. This must be Eichi-kun’s influence too.”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Hmm, I do not feel particularly influenced by the President in any way, so… I admit it is dispiriting to hear someone point it out so honestly.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “No~ Don’t worry, everyone in Yumenosaki is influenced in some way by their surroundings.</p><p>That’s what being an idol is. I think I’ve also gotten just slightly more optimistic under everyone’s influence.”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Fufu. Who keeps company with the wolf will learn how to howl, they say. I have recently started finding it a bother to keep up with the strict butler act, as well.</p><p>Perhaps I am letting a little of my true nature seep out.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Is that so~ I think you’re moving in a good direction, then. Fushimi-kun, you’ve always looked like you’re just acting out a role and being superficially polite.</p><p>It’s fine to act a little more like most boys your age do, really.”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Fufu. Is being ‘superficially polite’ not a trait we share, Aoba-sama?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “True enough. We should look to Trickstar for example and get along, as simply two boys of close age.</p><p>We’re staying under the same roof for the week, anyway.</p><p>Acting distant the whole time is going to leave us with stiff shoulders.”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “I find it more comfortable to act rigid, however.</p><p>It is something my classmates often chide me for, but speaking in an informal, intimate way is more exhausting to me.</p><p>However, I am hoping to learn… about what past <em>fine</em> was like from you, Aoba-sama.</p><p>I at least agree to the part where you said we should get along.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ahaha. There’s nothing interesting about past <em>fine</em> to hear, though.”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Yet, it is still necessary to know.

Of course, we understand that you’re busy, but can’t we really take a bit of your time? I believe it won’t take too long.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “…Hmm~ So it’s something pretty serious?</p><p>Then there’s no other choice, I suppose.

Or is that overfamiliar of me?</p><p>But I am sincere when I say that I’d like all of us to become friends who can feel sympathy and love for one another!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…Save for our names, we’re completely different, though. You and I.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “…Are you feeling unwell? You do not seem very spirited.

Are you friends with Fusshy?</p><p>You attached ‘-san’ to our names, but called Fusshy casually by given name, huh?”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Fusshy… Based on Akehoshi-san’s genius-level naming sense, I must suppose that is referring to Yuzuru?</p><p>Fufufu. It is an embarrassing story. He and I were trained at the same facility…</p><p>And the two of us were the only boys of our age, so yes, we were close.</p><p>Unfortunately, he seems to have grown resentful of me in the present. How lonely…</p><p>Yuzuru may badmouth me some, but please, do not believe in it too much.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hmm~ Fusshy can be pretty sharp-tongued, but I think he doesn’t speak badly of people without reason.</p><p>I don’t know him that well, though. Until recently, <em>fine</em> was our greatest enemy, after all.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “However! Trickstar splendidly defeated <em>fine</em> and attained the right to participate in SS, yes?</p><p>That is incredible! As someone of the same age, I admire you all!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “It was a miracle that we won, y’know~ A lot of people cheered us on and gave us a push on the back, and thanks to a little coincidence, we made a miracle happen.</p><p>Right now, we’re struggling to make ends meet with the results of that miracle.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “No, no, it <em>must</em> have been your true abilities! Please have more confidence in yourself! Humility may be a virtue, but when taken too far, it can seem more like mockery!”</p><p>(Hmm~ This is difficult. From their history of crawling from the bottom of the chain and having a miraculous victory…</p><p>I predicted them to have become a little conceited and unguarded.</p><p>Either their loss to Eve in summer cut them down to size, or they are nowhere as stupid as I thought they were… They are not showing as many weaknesses as I would like.</p><p>But well, if they put their guard up against us, they would be weighed down all the same.</p><p>I shall advance the battle while they can’t move as they like.

It feels like he’s surmising us from the depths of his narrowed eyes.</p><p>I’m not sure, but it gives me the creeps. Like my entire body’s being licked.</p><p>It’s unsettling.

What’s this? He’s sending stickers in bulk.</p><p>Ah, maybe… This is <em>that thing</em>, right?</p><p>Ahaha, I missed these! We used stickers as substitute for certain letters and made them into secret codes only we could read!</p><p>It was something we put together to kill time between our work… For some time, we played around chatting only with these stickers, right?</p><p>It’s so nostalgic.

That was faster than I expected.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha, Barry kept hanging around me and that gave me the creeps, so I made a run for it.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. It’s rare to hear you express avoidance of other people, saying they give you the creeps and all. Don’t you love other people, as a general rule?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I love them! But for some reason, I don’t feel like we can come to an understanding with the two guys from Adam and befriend them, you know~?</p><p>I can’t find a good way to phrase this, but they feel really far away.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… Well, we’ll have to face against them in SS, so there’s really no need to be friends.</p><p>Rather than that, you got the messages from Isara, right?</p><p>I deciphered it immediately, but… I still don’t understand what he wants. What do you think is his intention?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh, you decoded it already? That’s fast! I haven’t even managed to read half of it~”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Heh, I’m good at this kind of thing.

Oi, focus on the lecture, class rep~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Well, it’s hard to settle down when there’s a grid to fill.</p><p>Fufu. Shuuetsu Academy is almost like a different country to us, so I’ve found it hard to relax, but…</p><p>When I talk with you, I think I restored some of our usual feel.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah. We’ve been kinda weird, huh.</p><p>I’m especially worried about Sally, who seems devastated by that Nagisa guy’s words, and also Ukki…</p><p>Ukki seems to be seriously considering about joining their agency.</p><p>He gathered a bunch of documents and had his face buried on them the whole time.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yuuki belonged to a modeling agency in the past, so he must have less resistance to the idea than we do.</p><p>In our case, the thought of our positions largely changing is too hard to swallow, but…</p><p>I’m actually finding the agency to be an attractive proposition too.</p><p>Saegusa definitely selected the information he disclosed to us well, so despite seeing many merits to signing up to the agency, I fail to see any demerit.</p><p>If they would then tell us to disband Trickstar as a condition to join, I would oppose without hesitation.</p><p>But it seems we can gain some flexibility with work content and standings, depending on how well we negotiate.</p><p>Just by attending Shuuetsu’s lessons a little, I felt the difference in quality compared to Yumenosaki’s.</p><p>I feel myself growing fast and my flaws being neutralized.</p><p>There were first-class lecturers, experts of their fields, who quickly resolved the technical concerns I had with certain expressions.</p><p>They grasped my strengths and weaknesses and arranged a method where I could grow better.</p><p>Livelihood is serviced perfectly and jobs are in no way suspicious — the agency chooses what’s the most beneficial and gives it to us.</p><p>We can focus everything into becoming more radiant idols.</p><p>…I don’t see anything to pick at. If the agency would look after the content of our work and lessons, then there’s no worry about colliding with others, as well.</p><p>It won’t be a contest; individuals will grow in ways unique to them.</p><p>We won’t have to kick others down. They’re different in their very root compared to Yumenosaki’s competitivism.”</p><h3 id="deadly-poison-6">Deadly Poison 6</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Of course, this is because we are being treated as Special Students. It’s definitely a right that requires bloodbaths to earn.</p><p>We’ve been excused from that. We’re given only the merits.</p><p>We fought a desperate battle in DDD and raised as victors. We’ve acquired value as idols. That’s why we’re given the same privileges as Special Students.</p><p>But how was it in Yumenosaki? Did anything change?</p><p>We were bound to repeat battles to no end, on and on…</p><p>Didn’t the battle itself turned into purpose, hindering our growth as idols?</p><p>…I don’t know what’s right anymore.</p><p>Should we stay in Yumenosaki, stay as the ‘we, who were nobodies’, even to SS?</p><p>Shouldn’t we reform from the roots, and be reborn?</p><p>I think Yuuki is thinking of the same thing. He might seem like a fool sometimes, but he’s the wisest and most self-possessed of us all.</p><p>He knows how to calculate the merits and demerits of a decision in a concise fashion. He can set aside his emotions for a minute to seek the optimal solution.</p><p>So if Yuuki seems to be considering joining the agency seriously… there’s definitely a heavy meaning in that.</p><p>Akehoshi. What about you, what do you think? Can we really go on as we are? Should Trickstar change?</p><p>And if we shouldn’t, do you think we can win against Eden that way?</p><p>No. Do you think we can become more wonderful idols, like those of our dreams?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…I don’t get complicated stuffs, but…</p><p>This — it’s a little hard to say, since it’s incredibly personal, but…</p><p>At least from my perspective, I think this is a huge downside to entering an agency…</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Aii2FqI.jpg"></p><p>When we become part of the agency, they’ll decide the content of our job and everything else for us, right?</p><p>That means there’ll be nothing for Anzu to do.</p><p>Because probably, the agency will assign a producer or a manager to manage and raise us.</p><p>Even the content of our lessons today was a program for Special Students that the agency pushed at us. There was no room for Anzu to assert her opinion.</p><p>If we enter the agency, there’ll be no place for Anzu next to Trickstar.</p><p>And I’d really hate that to happen… I know, it’s a really personal and emotional reason.</p><p>Me, Hokke, Ukki, Sally, Anzu… We won DDD because the five of us were there. That’s how the miracle, the revolution happened.</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/nMGJCVj.jpg"></p><p>I don’t want there to cease to be five of us. I don’t want to lose anyone… Of course, I’m aware Anzu isn’t our exclusive producer.</p><p>She’s very much in demand among the other units, and they all want her. Even if we distance ourselves from her, she has many other places to belong.</p><p>And as a producer, she was an amateur until recently… The person the agency will assign us might be more competent.</p><p>Even so, Trickstar became what it is because it’s <em>us five</em>. If any one of us was missing, I’m sure the position we have now would greatly differ.</p><p>It’s because it’s the Trickstar we made together, that we’re given extravagant treatment like Special Students here in Shuuetsu.</p><p>So, I don’t want to cast anything away… as if we no longer have use for it, just because that’s the more beneficial choice.</p><p>I know you might get angry if I put things this way, Hokke.</p><p>You might say we’re not here to play around, that it’s work, that I shouldn’t say such selfish things…</p><p>That there’s no way around it. You’re strong, so you might be able to move forward, Hokke.</p><p>But that’s too much to ask from me. I can’t walk by myself.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Are you a baby?</p><p>…Well, I know what you’re trying to say.</p><p>We can’t decide in a heartbeat. Should we choose what’s profitable, or follow our hearts? And can we really win if we choose by heart? Become happy, become the idols we dreamed of?</p><p>Whether the world is that kind or not… I still don’t know either.</p><p>However, there’s little time to dwell on this. SS is nigh; it’s at the end of the year.</p><p>We have to move fast, or we won’t make it in time. We were given a choice at such a pressing time.</p><p>We can’t help but hesitate.</p><p>If there was only one goal, like <em>defeating the student council</em> or <em>reforming Yumenosaki</em>, we could’ve advanced without hesitation, but…</p><p>We wavered. …This must be part of Adam’s plan.</p><p>But we know this sort of plan by experience. Tomoe-senpai said the tactic in Summer Live was suggested to him by Adam, and they seem to be using a similar hand this time around.</p><p>If they think we’ll fall for the same trap twice, they’re looking down on us too much.</p><p>If we can read our opponent’s tactic, we can also build a counterattack. We can definitely take revenge this time, without things ending in our total defeat.</p><p>It seems Anzu and Isara are working to make that happen. That’s what the message we got said.</p><p>Last time might have been a one-sided massacre for the most part, but this one will be a proper battle. While they might’ve made the first strike, we can turn the tables on them from now.</p><p>Launching an attack means they’re prepared to be struck back. Let’s have our payback to our fill.</p><p>That’s what the <em>Revenge Match!</em>, as Anzu titled and planned, is for.</p><p>The war zone is endless, bitter, and unfamiliar… But we’ll survive, and give those guys, who are sitting back believing they’ve won, a good shock.</p><p>That’s what we are. …We’re Trickstar.”</p><h2 id="isolation">Isolation</h2><h3 id="isolation-1">Isolation 1</h3><p><strong>&gt; Autumn Live Stage (TS)</strong></p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “(humming)…♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hmm?

I’m gonna smack the back of your head to stop you; surely that’s fine~?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/ytVHxTk.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I’d like that you come up with a less violent method… Geez, you really have no respect for your master.</p><p>Anyway, then I’ll be telling you guys about things that can’t be researched through normal means.</p><p>So I say, but while I’m Nagisa-kun’s best friend for life… The kid who’s his companion — that venomous snake I don’t know much about, so have no expectations on that.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Snake…? Umm, is that about Nagisa-kun’s companion, that Saegusa boy?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes. He might be our comrade, but compared to Yumenosaki, we separate business and private life cleanly over here.</p><p>I don’t know much about that boy, besides what’s on the surface.</p><p>Onto the main subject. If possible, I ask that you don’t blabber about what I’m going to tell you to other people.</p><p>It’s not something to hide, per se… And it’s nothing that will affect our business, even if it’s known.</p><p>But you guys are enemies, and if it gets out that I’m selling such people info of my comrades, that’s not going to sound too good.</p><p>I will, to the end, speak as simply an old friend of you… Tsumugi-kun.</p><p>You took care of me when we were both in <em>fine</em>, after all. To pay you back, I’ll share you what I know; I’m sure if it’s you, you won’t use your friend’s info for bad too.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/ZEpnZNc.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Umm, if you’re going to speak only to Aoba-senpai, should Anzu and I excuse ourselves?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “No, you both can stay. You <em>are</em> the ones who will be facing against Adam, after all. It’s probably better to let you guys know…</p><p>I told you not to tell anyone a little while ago, just in case, but…</p><p>It’s quite the absurd story that I don’t think anyone will believe, even if you tell them.</p><p>Adam happens to be proficient at manipulating information, so we can erase it easily anyway.</p><p>Let’s see. First of all, let me speak of Nagisa-kun’s personal history.</p><p>It’s going to sound like a conspiracy theory from the start, and I’m aware of how ridiculous it is, myself.</p><p>On the shadow of the entertainment industry, there was someone who used to be pulling all the strings… the most powerful man, something of a godfather of this business.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Godfather… Eh, that sounds like a movie.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Though it’s reality. He had such a large influence over the industry, like some god, and I heard he even dabbled in crime-like, illegal things.</p><p>The notorious lord of the industry, you may say.</p><p>While he lived quite the long life, he has passed away for a good while now.</p><p>During the postmortem investigation, it was found that he had been sheltering one beautiful boy behind closed doors.</p><p>And that’s Nagisa-kun.</p><p>When he was found, he was already around middle school age.</p><p>However, he was adorned in a fancy room like some doll, not receiving any proper education.</p><p>Like another treasure cherished and put on display by an evil boss… The reason Nagisa-kun seems otherworldly even to this day was because of that history.</p><p>He’s a sad child, raised without knowing love. He was collected as an art piece, not a human being.</p><p>The information of his finding was within the bounds of my foundation’s power. After some turns and twists, he was temporarily left in my family’s care.</p><p>Only for a short time, though, until they could find a foster parent or guardian for him.</p><p>Of course, the kind boy I was, I taught Nagisa-kun many things and held his hand through every step, starting from ABC.</p><p>It was decided that my brother will be the heir to the foundation anyway, so being the easygoing second son, I had a lot of time on hand.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “You sure seem to love that kind of thing, Ohii-san.</p><p>Like buying over or picking up something, and cherishing it…? You’re even doting Bloody Mary to death.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Including noticing you and picking you off the ground, yes? You can thank me more.”</p><h3 id="isolation-3">Isolation 3</h3><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Anyway, maybe the don chose and sheltered him for this reason, but Nagisa-kun is blessed with natural looks, music sense, and intelligence.</p><p>God <em>does</em> bestow two, even three gifts to one person.</p><p>He might be falling a little behind, due to the lack of mandatory education, but he was always one with a fondness for studying, so he swiftly gained many skills and knowledge.</p><p>Finally, they found foster parents for him, and we had to part.</p><p>Even from those days, he always asserted about wanting to be an idol, for some reason.</p><p>That inspired me some too, that I started dreaming to become one myself…</p><p>So we locked our little fingers together and promised, that we’ll be reunited in the showbiz.</p><p>Well, that reunion happened sooner than expected.</p><p>When I enrolled to Yumenosaki and met him once more… he had undergone quite the transformation, but I’d like to believe what he had on his core hasn’t changed.</p><p>That the boy who would sing and dance into the night with me, as we laughed together about the fun and happiness of it—</p><p>That the dazzling child I knew is the true Nagisa-kun.</p><p>Right now, as Adam… he’s doing some rather extreme things, following the agency’s business strategy.</p><p>Taking over schools similar to us, treating the non-Special Students like slaves…</p><p>While I speak like an unrelated party, I take part in these things, as well. Because there are huge waves and powers that you just can’t defy…</p><p>But there was a time when we overturned that, right?</p><p>In Yumenosaki Academy. We performed a revolution as <em>fine,</em> didn’t we? I won’t say that what we did back then was all just, though.</p><p>But it won’t turn into a lie. It’s not a dream that’ll evaporate and disappear like foam.</p><p>That exaltation, like we’ve become protagonists of a story… I’m sure Nagisa-kun still remembers that sensation too.</p><p>For as long as those memories, that warmth, still exist… Nagisa-kun is the Nagisa-kun I love.</p><p>Or so I think, thus standing on the same stage as him as his partner even now, but… these days, I can’t help but tilt my head to some of his actions…</p><p>I think that venomous snake taught him some worthless things.</p><p>For some reason, Nagisa-kun just willingly obeys what he says, without complaining. Well, he was always an obedient, pure boy even back then.</p><p>He can’t be thinking to follow in the footsteps of the guy who isolated him, and become the second godfather, can he?</p><p>It somehow feels like things are going on that direction.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Isn’t that more Ibara’s agenda, than his?</p><p>After that notorious lord guy died, the matters under his control were divided up to various factions, apparently…</p><p>And Ibara is succeeding one of them, I hear. That’s why he has so many connections within the agency, the affiliated schools, and other related companies.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Hmm… So to make his ambitions come true, he’s utilizing Nagisa-kun as a means, a tool… and not just him but Eden, meaning us too.</p><p>He seems to be more interested in business matters than the whole idol flair, after all.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Even if he has skills. Well, the belief that you need incredibly hard work to make things happen is outdated these days, so if you just put in effort systemically, you can become good enough in anything.</p><p>That’s what an idol training school is for, in the first place.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “W-We ended up hearing something bigger than anticipated…</p><p>I don’t think Hiyori-kun will be lying at a time like this, but it’s a lot to swallow.</p><p>To my knowledge, Nagisa-kun might be a little weird, but he’s just a normal, good kid.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “That’s because your definition of what falls under ‘normal’ and ‘good kid’ is really wide, Tsumugi-kun.</p><p>Actually, since you’re pretty close to Nagisa-kun, I thought you might have known his circumstances.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “No, Nagisa-kun never speaks about himself. As if he has no ‘self’…</p><p>He didn’t mix in with the rest of the class, so I spoke to him, and that’s just how we normally became friends.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/nrFfCWv.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Hoho, that sure sounds like you, Tsumugi-kun.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. But Nagisa-kun’s harsh with ordinary people… or more like, he has a hard time acknowledging them…</p><p>It was hard to get him to remember my name, so maybe saying ‘we became friends’ is faulty.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Hmm~ Nagisa-kun is a genius, so he should have excellent memory along with the best of everything else, but…</p><p>He was raised isolated from the rest of the world during his early years, which is important to the development of personality for most people.</p><p>So he might really be lacking a ‘self’.</p><p>Human beings remember things starting from what’s related to their ‘selves’, so when one lacks that, they can become forgetful.</p><p>I also think it’ll be nice if I can leave some impression within him…</p><p>I mean to be showering him with a lot of my love, like watering a flower.</p><p>But it all feels like fruitless effort at times, and I start to view him like a bottomless hole.</p><p>Hey, Mao-kun—no, Trickstar… That’s the sort of child you’re fighting right now.</p><p>It’s a dark, deep hole that traps everything eternally, where not even light can find an escape…</p><p>He exists somewhere deep inside it, and you’ll have to find him.</p><p>You can’t storm in if you have no idea where the enemy is. So provoke him, toss some bombs…</p><p>Sing, dance, and pull him out of there.</p><p>That’s when things will really start. I’m his ally, his best friend, and even his family in the past; I’m too afraid to hurt him to use such forceful methods.</p><p>But you guys are his enemies, and you’re even in the middle of a war with him.</p><p>Plus, I know you’re experts at that…</p><p>Eichi-kun gave you all his seal of approval for that charm.</p><p>Anyone is pulled towards you. They’ll bend forward, wanting to see you closer. Because you’re idols…</p><p>So I have some expectations for you.</p><p>That’s why I went out of my way to teach you a lot about him, despite being busy. I’m cheering for you, so do your best.</p><p>But if you think that’s impossible, perhaps it’s better to pull back and retreat. …You don’t want to be swallowed into the darkness and vanish either, right?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “…….”</p><h3 id="isolation-4">Isolation 4</h3><p><strong>&gt; Adam’s Personal Room</strong></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…Ooh? Look, look, Hokke! There’s another message from Sally!</p><p>I can’t decipher these codes that fast, so tell me what it means! I wonder what Sally’s trying to tell us?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…….”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/F5jttTt.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hokke? It’s lonely if you don’t respond~….”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “(<em>munch</em>, <em>munch</em>, <em>gulp</em>)</p><p>…It’s against manners to speak while eating. Couldn’t you at least wait until I swallowed?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hokke, you’re surprisingly well-mannered, aren’t you! Damn young master~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That ‘surprisingly’ part doesn’t sit well with me, but…</p><p>My mother talks non-stop during meal like you do. This is the result of looking to her as an example on ‘how not to be’.</p><p>Grandma can be pretty strict about manners, too. And everything Grandma says is the absolute truth of the world, thus you’re the one in the wrong.</p><p>In any case; I see… Isara apparently headed off to Reimei with Anzu.</p><p>They were investigating some things, by getting in touch with Eve and inquiring them.</p><p>Since suspicion might be cast on him if he acts too weird, he will be attending lessons seriously from here on, like we’ve been doing.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. He did say we should be obedient and follow the schedule Shuuetsu set up for us.</p><p>That’s what the previous coded message was about.</p><p>I guess it means we should make use of the chance to take whatever can be gained?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, Shuuetsu Academy’s lessons and lectures really are of excellent quality, so there should be many things we can absorb.</p><p>Even just today, I managed to erase many of the dissatisfaction I held towards my own performance.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I see~ I still can’t feel it. It’s hard to know how far I’ve come when I practice alone. I wish we can practice as a group.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, that too will be necessary. There’s only one week until Autumn Live, after all.</p><p>For our performance there, we’ll need to train seriously together as Trickstar.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “We did get some practice done before we came to Shuuetsu, but there’s still some adjustments to be made, right? After observing the demographic, how the atmosphere’s gonna be like on the D-day, and the direction the concert’s taking.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Since the inn is reserved for our use with no other customer staying, we <em>can</em> practice as a group after returning from here.</p><p>But I’m having trouble deciding, since I feel it’s better to get some rest when we can or it’s going to come back to bite us later.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…I wonder if it’s Shuuetsu’s strategy to make us take classes and lessons individually, so we won’t have the chance to practice together.</p><p>No matter how much our individual skills might be honed, we won’t be able to make the best out of them during performance if we haven’t practiced together enough.</p><p>We might even fail to harmonize our growth and end up uncoordinated and stuff.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Perhaps. Though it’s laughable that they think they can break our unity with this.</p><p>But it is an effective tactic. It’s like receiving incessant blows.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yet on the surface, they’re promoting peace and taking our hand like a friend!</p><p>Argh, I really don’t like this! Isn’t Shuuetsu being kind of snide!?</p><p>I say the student council president’s much more gallant in the way he tried to crush us head on!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I think he’s not too great either…</p><p>But well, Isara and Anzu saw through the enemy’s trap, and are pretending to have fallen for it.</p><p>They’re using the time to form a counterattack.</p><p>So we’ll place our faith in our comrades and treat ourselves to all the gifts our enemies are sending us.</p><p>But without accepting their invitation. And we’ll look for the timing they let their guard down to chew their throats off.</p><p>We’ll give them a tearful shock just as they think they’ve tamed us.</p><p>Whether to really join the agency or not, that can be carefully considered later after Autumn Live is done with.</p><p>For now, let’s harmonize our paces and come as one, to crush the enemy’s plan.</p><p>Since we’ve all been divided, we won’t come across each other much… even so, there’s no choice but to have faith, that all of us are fighting with the same feelings.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. Though I luckily have Hokke around this time, we’re all fundamentally on our separate ways, huh?</p><p>The length of our lessons and lectures conflict too, so it’s hard to contact each other.</p><p>It really does feel like they’re intentionally pulling us apart…</p><p>Since we’re known for our unity, breaking us apart has kind turned into the basic tactic of all our opponents thus far, huh?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Thank you for the meal.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, you’re finally done? That took too long! Hokke, you prudent head!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What’s that supposed to mean…? If I didn’t chew properly, it would be bad for digestion. It was a rather heavy meal, too.</p><p>I think I ate too much. I need to rest a bit or I won’t be able to move as I like.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Even the meals are extravagant, huh? Each person has a menu fitted especially for them, and non-Special Students are the ones who come to deliver…</p><p>Forget that, they even brought in a cooking suite and cooked in front of us.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It’s like <em>what are we, royalties</em>? I don’t think I’ll ever get used to that, even if being served like that might be common for celebs.</p><p>Sometimes, my parents would bring me to some classy looking restaurant, too.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You know, I love how you just vaguely refer it as ‘some classy looking restaurant’; I can feel the Hokkeness.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What does Hokkeness even mean? Don’t start making up new words, Akehoshi.”</p><h3 id="isolation-5">Isolation 5</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Anyway, I’m going to do some exercise to help digest my meal.</p><p>I can leave the cutlery here without cleaning them up, and the non-Special Students will come to pick them up, right?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “They’re really like slaves, aren’t they~? I don’t know how they endure that.</p><p>You know how I’m overly friendly with people, so I’ve been talking to the non-Special Students whenever I meet them, too.</p><p>But instead of respect or any feeling of kinship, I’m feeling fear from them.</p><p>Maybe they think they’ll lose their chance to become a Special Student if they make a blunder.</p><p>I encountered this kid who kind of resembled how Shinonon was like when we first met.</p><p>But he was trembling the whole time, looking at me like I’m a monster. It was… really sad.</p><p>I think Yumenosaki is a strange school too, but right now, the people there get rewarded if they put in enough effort.</p><p>We can strive diligently, competing as rivals of even standing. Upperclassmen, underclassmen, it doesn’t matter. We can all sing and smile together.</p><p>I like that better. Even if, as an idol, aiming for the heights by stepping on others might be what’s needed.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I see. That’s very like you. But I haven’t come to such a clean decision.</p><p>It hits me whenever I see my parents, that this industry really is just an endless, narrow gate…</p><p>A day when we must make a difficult choice will surely come.</p><p>However, I also think it’s not something someone else should force or hurry you to do.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…!? Did you hear someone clap?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm?</p><p>Geh… uwaa, eh? W-Wha!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Calm down, Hokke! Use human language!</p><p>…Huh? Wait. Those people standing by the door are…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…I just finished deciphering Isara’s message to the end. It seems he and Anzu didn’t go to Reimei only to investigate things.</p><p>Another of their objectives… was to get in touch with ‘a certain person’ who acts as an interim lecturer in Reimei.</p><p>To create several results out of a single action—Anzu has grown up splendidly.</p><p>But I don’t get what she wants! What is the meaning behind this…?</p><p>Why have my parents come to Shuuetsu Academy!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, so it’s really Hokke Papa and Hokke Mama! It seems my mom’s been in their care before, but I’ve never met them directly myself!</p><p>Uwaah, uwaah! Hello, sir, ma’am!

Especially mother.</p><p>I’ve heard from Tomoe-senpai that father teaches at Reimei Academy sometimes, so I can understand why he’s here.</p><p><em>You</em>, on the other hand, I don’t get. What are <em>you</em> doing? There’s no pattern to your action.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Gee, call her ‘Mama’, not just ‘you’! You’ve made her wear a sad face~ You unfilial son! Still in your rebellious phase!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I have never called that woman ‘Mama’, even once, since I was born.</p><p>…Umm, so what did you come for, really? Explain, Father. I’d like to believe you’re more sensible than her.</p><p>Hmm… So not just Reimei; you also have the right to hold lectures at Shuuetsu and other affiliated schools by contract.</p><p>And so you entered the school building by making use of that authority?</p><p>What for? You <em>can’t</em> be thinking to hold my hand through my lessons like proper parents after all this time, right?</p><p>You’re not very deft, Father; you don’t know how to teach outside of what you yourself can do, right?</p><p>I am different from you. I am not your imitation, so I don’t need your teaching.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Wow, sharp~… Treat your parents well, Hokke.</p><p>Just the fact you can lean on them and touch them makes you blessed, you know, Hokke.</p><p>Though… Sorry. I didn’t mean to sound spiteful; that kind of came out strangely.</p><p>Whoa!? This time Hokke Papa’s hugging me!

And Fusshy and Blue-senpai and other support members too, come over here!</p><p>Let’s huddle together! We’re gonna combine our Yumenosaki powers into one and win against Adam!”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Fufu.

We’ll give it our best shot, so that won’t happen. We don’t need a repeat of Summer Live.</p><p>Everyone, you’ve worked hard until today.

I have a hard time understanding.</p><p>Anzu, do you know something? You were the one who contacted them and requested them to do something for you, right?</p><p>Can I think of my parents’ appearance… as part of your strategy as well, Anzu?</p><p>If you invited them just to tease me, I’m going to be a little angry with you.</p><p>I was on edge throughout the week with the thought that those two might appear again, and wasted a lot of energy, you know.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha.

I feel some Anzuness in it though, so it’s still a little surprising…</p><p>But it does feel more like <em>fine</em> than us. Like these fluttering things on our shoulders.”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Fufu. We are active across the nation and the globe, so part of the population thinks of <em>fine</em> as a trademark of Yumenosaki.</p><p>So the intent is to utilize a similar design to make it clear that you are also a Yumenosaki unit like us, thus gathering support from that population.</p><p>Asides from that, Anzu-san was the one to perform detailed adjustments to the design.</p><p>So perhaps that is where this ‘Anzuness’ you spoke of is coming from, Akehoshi-sama.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I see~ Now I can see why it’s so comfortable to wear!</p><p>Anzu’s the leading figure when it comes to our costumes, and she fully grasps the little changes in our physique too.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. She’d often take our measurements with a tailor’s tape even in the classroom. Maybe that’s Anzu’s hobby.</p><p>It was unnerving at first, but Anzu looked so happy doing it, so I couldn’t bring myself to say anything.</p><p>But even though she loves making costumes so much, were our costumes this time outsourced for the most part?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. It’s not so much that she outsourced it… The agency decided several details like the design of the costumes and stage, for this Autumn Live.</p><p>And it wasn’t smart to oppose that, without any big reason to.</p><p>Anzu-chan also had other things she must get done as a producer, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Indeed. Time and stamina both have their limits…</p><p>I believe Anzu-san gave a careful consideration on what she should prioritize, so you all can release your full strength on the performance.</p><p>Although… the fact she insisted to make detailed adjustments to the costumes certainly astonishes me, as it must mean she really loves such a work.”</p><h3 id="battle-2">Battle 2</h3><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I see~ Until now, Anzu has always tried to do everything herself and ended up getting kind of overheated on the real deal, but…</p><p>Even if it broke your heart, you made a choice and cast some things away, didn’t you, Anzu?</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/1Evj5xD.jpg"></p><p>That’s commendable. No, not that—thank you… for giving it your all.</p><p>Our opponent is that famous Adam, and it might be a lonely struggle among many enemies, but I don’t have any fear.</p><p>We’re going to win, so watch us. Like you always do, from the VIP seat closest to us.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Akehoshi. You might speak of winning, but there’s no real victory and defeat in the Autumn Live.</p><p>It’s different from Yumenosaki. There’s no DreamFest system… no voting mechanism either.</p><p>Performers will simply take the stages following the schedule.</p><p>The audience will move as they like, watching the performance they’re interested in, or buying food from the stalls to eat.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Like a summer music fest, huh? Or rather… it’s really like an ‘event’.</p><p>Numbers of audience gathered, how heated the performance was… those sort of results that decide the winner and loser become hard to tally.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Alright, then we should make our own victory condition! If we can gather more people than Adam and get them heated up more, it’s our win!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Challenge accepted. I don’t hate playing for stakes. Well, it’s another school’s event this time around, so it’s fundamentally different from usual DreamFests.</p><p>So it might be better to not think of victory or defeat, and just perform to our all.</p><p>The fight hasn’t started yet so we can still relax like this, but I doubt we’ll be able to think of such matters once it begins.</p><p>It’s a big event, after all.</p><p>Even if to the agency, it might simply be another routine to go through…</p><p>The number of people mobilized and the anticipation rival that of Yumenosaki’s S1.</p><p>It makes you realize how enormous the enemy is. Well, not that we’ll get cold feet from that.</p><p>We had our training and did everything we could. This is the best our current selves could work up. Whether it’ll work or not is still left to be seen, but let’s just do what we can.</p><p>And if possible, then I want revenge. Let’s work to pay back that loss we experienced.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Copy that, Leader♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ooi, don’t get fired up all by yourselves.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup. Since when Trickstar became a two-person unit like Adam~?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/111iiXM.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Sally! Ukki! Huh? I thought you guys already came over when Hokke said to gather around!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Sorry, sorry. We did hear you guys say to gather around, but we were a little far, so…</p><p>It was tough trying to cut through the crowd, so we arrived a little late.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, where did you go? Hehe, let me guess: the toilet?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “No no, we just made a visit to Adam for a bit.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? Why? We all visited them to say ‘Let’s do our best today’ at the start, so we already concluded the formality, right?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup. Peaceful and cordial on the surface.</p><p>They didn’t reveal their malicious intent until the end, huh…</p><p>I guess they still think we can be dealt with diplomatically… or rather, through little traps.</p><p>Plus, they welcomed and serviced us lavishly when in Shuuetsu.</p><p>They showed hints of trying to waver us to their side, to join the agency.</p><p>They probably wanted to win us over.</p><p>Rather than killing the enemy, crushing us completely, it’s certainly more profitable to pull us to their side. So they faked their kindness.</p><p>But I couldn’t predict how things might turn out if they decide to have war and crush us with their all, so…</p><p>I spent the week investigating various things.</p><p>Since thankfully, my face isn’t that known yet, I pretended to be one of the underlings and mingled with some non-Special Students…</p><p>I’m pretty good at that.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “When wearing glasses and acting all mousy, Makoto looks like the very image of an ‘underachiever’ and gets made light of, eh?</p><p>I can pull off something similar too, but it definitely won’t work with Subaru and Hokuto.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmph. I can do it if I try too. I’m in the Theater Club.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nope, for better or worse, you guys just give off an aura. Makoto’s amazing when he’s serious too, but he knows how to hide it when needed.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Right. So I attended lessons like instructed, but also investigated the scene and searched the net, basically going from all sides.</p><p>There’s need to know what the enemy troops are like, or the war will be really daunting.</p><p>Their defense is steely, like anticipated; they control their information flow well so I had a hard time during my research.</p><p>But when meeting with Adam with Isara-kun, I got to read their reactions and stuff.</p><p>I think I have all the information needed. …It’s just that, from my analysis, I think fighting against Adam for real is going to be dangerous.</p><p>We won’t come out unharmed.</p><p>If a war breaks out and we <em>really</em> want to win, we should be prepared to make certain sacrifices. It’s going to be an undisputed mutual destruction.</p><p>Although I think they won’t fire a real ammo until the important big game, SS.</p><p>On the other hand, this means it might be better for us to focus on defending too, and minimize the damage.</p><p>Because I believe they won’t come for the kill yet this time.</p><p>Of course, I’ll follow whatever strategy our producer Anzu-chan and our leader Hidaka-kun decide on.</p><p>I just want to warn that it might be too soon to put our lives on the line and use up all of the cards in our sleeves.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. SS is the big game, and this is to the end a skirmish. Even so, I feel if we don’t give our all… if we let our guard down, it’s going to be an instant death.</p><p>It’s hard to be the lower ranked ones. But if we struggle without giving up and survive, there should be a way to win.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…Putting that aside. Sally, were you okay?</p><p>You met with Adam. Did that Nagisa guy say something cruel to you again?</p><p>I’m a little afraid of that person… I couldn’t talk with him so I don’t know him. But he feels like someone we shouldn’t get too involved with.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “It’s so rare to hear you say something like that, Subaru. Well, he’s definitely someone that might feel alien… freakish for us.</p><p>But he’s the boss of our greatest adversary in SS, Eden. We can’t keep avoiding him.</p><p>Plus, I wanted to tell him the answer I found after my long deliberation.</p><p>It’s too annoying stay quiet after he walked all over me like that, and I might end up dragging it out, y’know…</p><p>So I wanted to make sure to spew out everything before the performance and make myself lighter.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. That sounds like you really just went to the toilet.”</p><h3 id="battle-3">Battle 3</h3><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…Hey, Sally. You’re probably still thinking about what that Nagisa guy said.</p><p>But instead of what the enemy, what some random guy said, I want you to recall the memories we’ve had together…</p><p>I want you to believe in all the happenings, the conversations amassed within them.</p><p>Sally, have we ever said that you’re like a flashlight—or that we don’t need you because of that, even once?</p><p>We’ve been comrades who have faith in each other, who love and support each other, right?</p><p>We won’t distance ourselves from you, and we don’t want to… So don’t let it disturb you; stay by our side today, tomorrow, to the future and forever, okay?</p><p>It’s not Trickstar without you. What do those guys we just met think they know about us, anyway?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “No. I’m happy that you’d say that for me, enough to say I’m glad for being born to hear it, but…</p><p>What that person… What Nagisa-san said is also one facet of the truth.</p><p>He hit the nail on the head with me. Pierced me right on the fragile depth I’ve always held inside, at first contact…</p><p>And it hurt so much, it was so painful, that I wished I could spared from it all, but…</p><p>I’m glad someone said it to me <em>this time</em>. It’s something I’ll have to face sooner or later.</p><p>You guys are kind, so you’ll never say anything cruel to me. That’s why I’m glad to meet an enemy who would strike without mercy.</p><p>I’m an unfair, stealthy guy who always stay at my safe zone.</p><p>I was even deluded enough to think that was my role, that it was the necessary step to protect and support you guys, who always try to do the impossible.</p><p>So I’m thrilled.</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/h4ps2Wq.jpg"></p><p>That I have something to improve, that there’s a fearsome enemy aiming for that weak spot of mine, that I still need to fight to death…</p><p>That’s totally like a shounen manga.</p><p>I feel like I’ve finally become one of you guys in the truest meaning.</p><p>It’s the producer’s job to convey the battle strategy from the safe zone. Me, I need to head to the battlefield with you guys and bathe in blood.</p><p>Maybe, I <em>might</em> really turn out to be a foolish flashlight who’s mistaking himself for a star.</p><p>Because you guys are shining so blindingly, I might have been deluded to think that I’m shining too, when in fact I’m just receiving light from you.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “That’s not true! You’re Trickstar too, Sally! You’re our star!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Thanks. But when need be, I want you to discard me.</p><p>Cut me off and don’t look back. Find a star that shines brighter and let him in.</p><p>If you do that, you’ll never lose to anyone.</p><p>To win SS is the dream of all idols, and your dad’s ungranted desire, right… Subaru?</p><p>If it’s what you need to do to win, then I want you to discard me anytime.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Sally…? I don’t want that! Winning is worth nothing if you’re not with us!”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Isara-kun… You shouldn’t say that. It won’t make anyone happy.</p><p>I know because I’ve experienced it. If you need to cast everything aside to achieve something, you’ll be left with nothing but a feeling of vacuity in your grasp.</p><p>You’ll regret it. There’s no blue bird of happiness waiting at such a place.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yep. So I’ll work hard so that won’t have to happen.</p><p>I’ll desperately hold onto you guys and cover what I lack with effort. I’ll shine even if it sucked every bit of life out of me.</p><p>I’ll make a huge explosion with the amount of heat a flashlight shouldn’t have, and turn into a star like you guys.</p><p>For that sake I stepped out of my safe zone, and I’ll give it my all even if things are painful and tough.</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/W2ln4kt.jpg"></p><p>That makes me happy. I’ve always yearned for something like that.</p><p>You know, I’ve also wanted to become like manga protagonists that I love… to become like you guys, and shine dazzlingly.</p><p>I’ve burned the bridges behind me. When there’s no escape, there’s also no choice but to fight head on. I didn’t want to be hurt, to be in pain, to be hated by anyone, but…</p><p>I need to bear all that to live on. Nah—if I can’t bear that, I’ll just end up with a tranquil, drawn-out life full of regrets. And that’s not what I want.</p><p>Ever since I was a brat, I thought I was fine with being second or third.</p><p>If I come out first, I’ll have to bear with someone’s resentment and hate. I’ve always hated competitions; I couldn’t feel happy with winning or losing.</p><p>Losing is frustrating, but winning means I’ve kicked someone down and hurt them.</p><p>Everyone told me I’m kind for that, but I was just a spoiled brat who wanted to avoid any unpleasant feelings.</p><p>I don’t want to be like that anymore. I want to fight together with you guys, aim for the top, and win proudly with a smile on me.</p><p>To say ‘<em>How’s that? Aren’t I… Aren’t</em> we <em>awesome?’</em></p><p>To say that <em>Trickstar</em>’s awesome! I want to take pride in it to my heart’s fill, and have someone praise me!</p><p>Not getting commended for being an adult, by handing over the trophy to someone else!</p><p>I wanted to do something great with my own — with our own power, so someone would praise me!</p><p>Don’t you think that’s stupid? I’ve never had that experience!</p><p>I’ve always treated everything like I’m not involved, like I understand the big picture, like I’m mature for backing off!</p><p>But I’m still a child! I’m a child who dream, like you guys!</p><p>So I want to wake up to that fact and make a racket without caring for what people think! Like you guys do…!</p><p>This is my own selfish circumstance, and I’m just doing what I want, so I won’t hear you out even if you ask if I’m fine with it!</p><p>I don’t care if this wasn’t the correct answer! I’m going to do what I’ve avoided doing all this time!</p><p>And you know, when I decided all these things—the fun just came to me!</p><p>Ahaha! I want to sing and dance right now! Has Autumn Live started yet?</p><p>I can’t wait for it! There’s nothing but fun waiting beyond, I bet!”</p><h3 id="battle-4">Battle 4</h3><p><strong>&gt; Autumn Live Stage (Ad)</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Q9bOvMj.jpg"></p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Your Excellency~ This is the script for today♪</p><p>As always, it is a complete guide that details everything starting from your actions and words atop the stage, to how to interact with me and communicate with the audience.</p><p>You will make no mistake if you follow what it says.</p><p>This Autumn Live, too, will end in Adam’s complete victory!</p><p>No—we will achieve a magnificent glory that goes beyond victory and defeat!</p><p>Now!

Is there something that dissatisfies you?”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…It’s not that. Thank you, for always.</p><p>…It’s very helpful. It’s thanks to you, Ibara, that I can fathom my position in this world.</p><p>…I really don’t understand.</p><p>…When I was child, the world was much narrower, much simpler.</p><p>…Now everything is so vast and vibrant; it confuses me.</p><p>…But you would take care of all those complicated, mysterious matters for me.</p><p>…And I only need to do the simple things like in the past, to do only what you tell me.</p><p>…It’s a very easy way to be. So I’m grateful to you.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “No no, there is no need for thanks! I’m unworthy of such words! Ah, I can’t see in front of me because of these tears of happiness!</p><p>I, Saegusa Ibara, am relishing in all of life’s joys!</p><p>…I am simply profiting from using you, Your Excellency. Of course, you should be aware of that as well.</p><p>So there is truly no need to show me gratitude. The uneasiness is giving me the shivers.</p><p>I am the lowest of the low; to be hated and resented is what’s natural of me.</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/vscRiHl.jpg"></p><p>So, when you tell me ‘thank you’… with such sincerity… I do not know how to react.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…So even someone as smart as you don’t know some things, Ibara.</p><p>…It’s a world full of riddles, full of things that mystify us.</p><p>…Life is divine punishment, God is mischievous, and the world is a hell to make us suffer.</p><p>…But seeing as we’ve been born, there’s no choice but to live on.</p><p>…You, me, everyone. Even those children.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Hmm… Trickstar. They are tougher than I anticipated.</p><p>They saw through all of my plans, dealt with them, thus leaving me with none of the battle results I expected.</p><p>I am ashamed of my inadequacy.</p><p>Well, we chose the method that wouldn’t require bloodshed and avoided making any war declaration, so this is good enough.</p><p>It is far too soon to be firing real ammunition.</p><p>I already hinted in a conversation that we’re aware of the matter with Akehoshi-san’s father—</p><p>An implicit threat that we won’t hesitate to use that info to our advantage in a pinch.</p><p>True war weapons can render the enemy vulnerable through mere demonstration. Our ultimate weapon is in our hand.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…A long time ago, I met that boy’s father.</p><p>…It was for just a short time, but he taught me how to sing.</p><p>…It feels like fate that I’ll have to face his son now.</p><p>…God is as mischievous as ever today.</p><p>…Anyway, Ibara. I won’t be needing the script. To be more precise, I think I <em>can’t</em> use it.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Huh? Was it not to your liking? Is it because the ‘Fuhahahaha!’ does not settle with your kind and tender nature, Your Excellency?</p><p>But I wanted to enforce the atmosphere of an absolute ruler!</p><p>And it is the agency’s wish that we emphasize on masculinity. They also gave us the name ‘Adam’, which I agree is troublesome to live up to.</p><p>Even so, we need to endure and act as is asked of us.</p><p>If we do not fulfill the demands of the mass, we can be swept away from our standing. Foolish as they are, humanity will always yearn for the fruit of knowledge.</p><p>Vested interest, control, influence, glory, fame… They yearn for the fruit of paradise of such shapes.”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…I can’t comprehend people’s sense for that.</p><p>…But I understand they are important. And I understand that you yearn so maddeningly for them.</p><p>…But that’s not the problem.</p><p>…You weren’t cautious enough, Ibara. It doesn’t seem like Trickstar is just going to lie down and let us walk all over them.</p><p>…You haven’t noticed? The air in the battlefield has been repainted without our knowledge.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Huh… that would mean?”</p><p><strong>Nagisa:</strong> “…That we should avoid acting like an imposing ruler according to your script.</p><p>…We’ll be inviting opposition. All pain and no gain.</p><p>…How rare. Your strategy has fallen apart, Ibara.

Anyway, I think that’s Anzu’s plan.</p><p>In Summer Live, she could only stand and watch as we were pummeled…</p><p>That definitely frustrated her.</p><p>Like us, that girl hates losing.</p><p>However, in Shuuetsu and affiliated schools, the agency’s power is far too overwhelming. If she made an obvious move, she would be the one attracting attention and getting crushed.</p><p>In business, it means nothing that the opponent is a child.</p><p>She forecasted that and, despite the limited options and lack of freedom… Anzu secretly played an effective card.</p><p>She borrowed a mighty force: my parents.</p><p>It’s normal for parents to be supporting their child, so there’s nothing strange with them doing things for me… at least, that’s viable as an excuse.</p><p>Do you understand what it means to seek for my parents’ aid with promotion? My mother aside, my father was especially invited and pleaded to be a lecturer here.</p><p>He’s not a subordinate of the agency, but a business partner.</p><p>And his position as a lecturer means he’s someone who guides students and assesses them.</p><p>So if they can gain my parents’ favor, becoming a Special Student won’t be a mere dream…</p><p>It’s possible to lead the students to think that way, and perhaps my parents intentionally hinted at it.

I think the tale of our revolution where we triumphed over our oppressors in Yumenosaki were also told during the promotions.</p><p>‘We, who were nobodies,’ succeeded and achieved glory.

What are you doing?</p><p>Hmm, so you’re in the middle of work, again…? The student council president requested some things from you, so you’re out to shop? It’s break, though. If you keep at that, you’ll find yourself passing out from exhaustion one of these days.</p><p>Fufu. Because of your big success with Tanabata Festival from a while back, you must’ve garnered much esteem as a producer.</p><p>That’s why they keep requesting you for work, isn’t it?</p><p>Right right, that happens a lot. The happy sort of busyness, isn’t it? Of course everyone wants to give work to the person with capabilities.</p><p>But I see. So you’re in the middle of working for the student council…</p><p>I guess that means you won’t show up for our practice for Summer Live this afternoon?</p><p>I’m sure it’s a good thing that you’re so well-regarded now, Anzu-chan.</p><p>But as a result, you starting to get lots of work unrelated to us Trickstar, too… I feel we’ve become distant, it’s a little lonely.</p><p>Although you never were exclusive to us; you’re everyone’s producer.</p><p>Hmm? What’s with that pose…? Why are you enthusiastically waving around that Trickstar hand fan?</p><p>You make some strange gestures sometimes, Anzu-chan… Is that supposed to be your way of asserting <em>‘Don’t worry, I’m still Trickstar’s fan’</em>?</p><p>Thank you. It’s okay, I wasn’t doubting that. Thanks for always cheering on us, for always supporting us.</p><p>We have faith in you and treasure you all the same, you know… Producer♪</p><p>Fufu. How about I help out with work?</p><p>I’m free until our lesson in the afternoon, so I was just about to wander around the arcades.</p><p>I’m thinking if your work can be finished early, you might get some time to check out our practice.</p><p>I know everyone will be happy if you show up, Anzu-chan.</p><p>Ahaha. Don’t hold back~</p><p>If you’re out shopping, you’ll need someone to carry all the luggage, right? I’ve been working out on my own initiative since Oogami-kun’s drills, so I should be in shape.</p><p>Despite how I look, I’m still a guy, so I’ll be happy to be relied on… Err, though I won’t force you if you don’t want to.</p><p>…Really? I can help? Yay! At your service, then♪”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Hiyori-kuuun? And uh, Sazanami-kun? Is anyone from Reimei Academy here?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hn? Huh, that’s Aoba-senpai from Switch, right…? What is he doing?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Oh? Hello, Anzu-chan, Yuuki-kun~♪”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/3wjWrKg.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hello, Aoba-senpai. Is something wrong? It seems you were looking for someone…”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ah, yes. As part of Trickstar, you should know already, Yuuki-kun. We’re inviting students from another school as guest stars for the Summer Live that will be held the week after the next.</p><p>Today, I’m supposed to pick them up from the station and show them until Yumenosaki…</p><p>…but they haven’t shown up even past the promised time, so I’m at loss.</p><p>Umm, the two of you, have you seen anyone who might be them, somewhere?</p><p>I can’t describe them well, but uh… they should be like, wearing the Reimei Academy uniform!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Reimei Academy… Ah, the newly-established school that’s been the talk recently, huh? It’s been a hot topic throughout the internet that they’re rapidly rising in power.</p><p>I see. So idols from Reimei Academy will be taking part in the Summer Live.</p><p>We Trickstar are taking part in the Summer Live as a representative of Yumenosaki Academy…</p><p>But I still don’t know much since they haven’t told us the details.</p><p>Huh? Wait, I heard we’re the only Yumenosaki idols participating…</p><p>Aoba-senpai, is Switch going to take part as well?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “No, no. I was asked to be the guide because I’m acquainted with the Reimei representative, that’s all.</p><p>He’s hard to please, so we fear he might just go home if we’re not careful.</p><p>…Oh, speak of the Devil. It’s a call from the problem child.</p><p>Excuse me for a moment… Hello, Hiyori-kun? Where are you right now?</p><p>Eh!? You spotted a good store so you went there to browse around? You’ll go to Yumenosaki once you’ve shopped to your fill?</p><p>No no, <em>please</em> don’t just do whatever you want and cause me trouble!</p><p>Hiyori-kun, wasn’t there a time you totally ignored your promise and shopped until night after saying that!?</p><p>Argh, sheesh! I’ll pick you up at the store so please tell me the name!</p><p>Please don’t move from there, okay? Geez, as impetuous as ever…!</p><p>Uugh. Umm, I’m sorry, Yuuki-kun… You too, Anzu-chan.</p><p>I think you heard our conversation; I’ll be going to the store that the Reimei kids are visiting.</p><p>So please excuse me.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, yes… I don’t know what’s going on, but please hang in there.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Sure~ This type of thing was an everyday occurrence back when I was still in <em>fine</em>, so I’m used to it to an extent.</p><p>But it’s been such long while, I’ve forgotten the tricks.</p><p>Fufu. I don’t wish to speak ill of my old friend, but…</p><p>He’s one taxing child to deal with, so… please be careful, Trickstar.</p><p>Drop your guard and you’ll just be played to the end.”</p><h2 id="omen">Omen</h2><h3 id="omen-1">Omen 1</h3><p><strong>&gt; In front of the fountain</strong></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oi, Hokke! Good morning good morning good morniiing☆”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Q6GWqa3.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Uwoh. I’m always telling you this but stop jumping at me like that, Akehoshi. I don’t know if you’ve been rolling around on the ground again or what, but you’re full of stains and you’ll dirty my clothes.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Whoa, how can you give me a scolding instead of a greeting first? What’s up, Hokke? You’re looking particularly tense today.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m my usual self. Well, perhaps I’m not…</p><p>Akehoshi, is my smile oozing with confidence like it should?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Forget that, your face muscles aren’t twitching one bit! Hokke, even though you’re part of the Theater Club, you always end up with an unnatural and stiff look whenever you try to form an expression!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, buchou often said that to me. I see, so I didn’t manage to smile… I want to show up to battle with a fearless, dignified attitude, though.</p><p>Akehoshi, do something funny.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eeh~…? Even if you suddenly say that…</p><p>‘Hello, I’m Subaru!’ ‘I’m Daikichi (<em>excellent luck</em>)!’ ‘Together, we’re the Fortune-Slip Duo!’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>‘What the heck kind of fortune slip are you!?’”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh, that wasn’t funny!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, I’m just starting to wonder for real… What the heck kind of fortune slip are you?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hokke just gave me a <em>tsukkomi</em>!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Huh, so Daikichi-kun was with you, Akehoshi. You’ve been taking your dog on a walk?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah, the Yumenosaki Academy grounds are part of his walking trail! Daikichi’s Papa—isn’t around anymore, but apparently, he used to be taken on a walk here often.</p><p>Obviously this little guy couldn’t have remembered, but can’t something or the other possibly be passed onto his genes? Like ‘<em>This is the path I must live</em>…’ type of thing…!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What type of thing is that? Taking dogs on a walk inside the school is fundamentally forbidden. Restrain yourself. If you need a walking trail, there’s the path near the sea; take him there instead.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, we’d jog there often, huh?</p><p>But the sands might stick to him and that’ll be a pain to wash~ He’d run off to the sandy beach to look for sparkling things and hurt himself stepping on seashells and the like!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You; despite responding friendlily, you almost never listen to other people’s request and force your will through with _if_s and _but_s… Pertinacious guy.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Aren’t you the same in that regard, Hokke? Wow, peas in a pod, aren’t we! Let’s be friends forever☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Are we really? I think we’re opposites. How does the world look in your eyes?</p><p>That aside. I’ve relaxed after talking with you. Thanks, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “No problem! Doing a routine calms the mind, right? ♪</p><p>But hey, Hokke, what are you doing here in broad daylight? Theater Club stuff? Practice for that Summer Live whatever thing is in the afternoon, right?”</p><p>Damn, did I mistake the meeting time!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You didn’t, it’s fine. It’s rare of you to remember the schedule, Akehoshi. Nice work.</p><p>Our lesson starts afternoon. Don’t skip and don’t be late.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I know. That’s why I’m walking Daikichi and finishing off other business while it’s still the day.</p><p>Fufu. It’s great that my schedule’s been full lately,</p><p>but Daikichi’s gotten fat again because I’ve been too busy to walk him.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I see… I think he’s cuter all soft and round, though.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “If you think he’s cute then pet him! He’ll be happy if you pet him! Since he’s a dog!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Sorry, I’ll pass. I have to attend a meeting for the Summer Live as Trickstar’s leader.</p><p>It’ll be uncourtly to show up with dog hairs on me.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, that’s why you were worried about your clothes when we met and scolded me more harshly than usual?</p><p>But right, Trickstar’s leader was you, huh, Hokke… Is it really okay that the rest of us don’t participate in that… meeting thing?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Greeting for the rest of the members will happen in the afternoon, with the lesson.</p><p>The meeting at noon is just preparations. It appears the other leader has something to say for us, as well.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Fufufu~ Should I join you, then? If you’re left to your own device, Hokke, you’ll take every fight people pick and make things complicated!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Really? I only say what should be made clear.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “And end up in an argument every time, right? Not that I have a problem. That’s just who you are, Hokke.</p><p>I don’t really get it, but do your best on the meeting… Leader♪ Call me if you’re in a pinch. I’ll tactlessly barge in and bail you out!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t barge. Still; thanks a lot, Akehoshi.”</p><h3 id="omen-2">Omen 2</h3><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “But hey, Hokke… So in the end… what <em>is</em> the Summer Live?</p><p>We were frantic when you just suddenly broke it to us that we’ll be participating in a large-scale live and need to free up our schedules.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I don’t know the details, either. The student council president personally called me to his office and told me that.</p><p>It didn’t feel like he’d give us a choice; not that that’s any different than usual.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, you got called through a broadcast yesterday, didn’t you, Hokke? That was kinda shocking to me, like it’s going to be the second coming of the whole DDD nightmare!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm, but breaking up Trickstar this late will only demerit him. Plus, we’ve become relatively well-known to the outside world.</p><p>His order of dissolve back then was only effective because we were still newborn and unstable as a unit.</p><p>None of us will be swayed at whatever anyone says now.</p><p>We’ve solidified our base and grown strong and sturdy; this is the stage where we must improve on ourselves for SS at the end of the year.</p><p>We’re the representative for Yumenosaki Academy. Pitting us against each other and ruining us won’t benefit the student council president.</p><p>Though well, I don’t doubt that he has a hidden agenda.</p><p>However, in SS, where we must fight against power units from outside the academy, the student council president is an ally.</p><p>He’ll back us up as a fellow Yumenosaki idol… at least we have no choice but believe that.</p><p>Doesn’t mean we can slack our guard, though. This Summer Live thing is kind of fishy, too…</p><p>It seems to be something like an interschool competition, so we can’t count on what’s considered common sense in Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>We must be careful as to not shame ourselves in front of strangers. Especially you, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I know! I’ll be a good boy♪</p><p>Hokke, you shouldn’t start quarreling with the guys from the other school, too.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. I know. Leave it to me, Akehoshi. My preparations are flawless, as always.</p><p>Oh, I can’t be wasting time on chatting. It’s about time to go to the student council room… We’ll see each other again at practice in the afternoon, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Of course. See ya, Hokke~…♪”</p><p><strong>&gt; Student Council Room</strong></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Excuse me.</p><p>Trickstar’s leader, Hidaka Hokuto, is here.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/MffNhGN.jpg"></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Welcome.</p><p>Fufu. I’m happy to see your face, Hokuto. You seem rather pleased; did anything good happen?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m the same as usual. I think it’s you who seem excited about something.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “To return your words: I’m the same as usual.</p><p>Fufu, it feels so nice when things are going according to your plan. As I thought, working things out in the background is so much easier and relaxing.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Are you scheming something again, Student Council President?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “What sort of character do you take me for? Well, I brought that upon myself, so I guess I can’t complain.</p><p>I’m not scheming anything evil. It’s just another setup to grant the dream I long for.</p><p>In any case, it seems our guest will be late, so you’ll have to wait. Take a seat, Hokuto.</p><p>How about a cup of tea? I’ve gotten hold of some exquisite tea leaves.</p><p>My doctor restricted my consumption of caffeine, but drinking isn’t the only way to enjoy a tea.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What are you babbling on about…? I don’t need tea when I can’t tell what you put in it.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “A pity. They’re <em>so</em> good, though~… Don’t be so nervous, Hokuto.</p><p>A clever boy like you would know that I’m not your enemy in this situation.</p><p>While I can’t have you depending on me too much, I still wish to back you up, since you guys are Yumenosaki Academy’s representative.</p><p>That’s what the Summer Live is for. A practice for the coming SS; a chance to compete with a powerful opponent of another school.</p><p>I’ll be sending you guys for more of such <em>pilgrimages</em> in the future to let you earn abundance of experience. It’s better that you learn the ropes as fast as you can.</p><p>One of these days, I’ll send you on a job befitting of a representative of Yumenosaki.</p><p>Calling in opponents from other schools to Yumenosaki Academy to fight against, for one. Depending on the situation, perhaps even a live tour throughout the country.</p><p>I want you to feel the broadness of the world and confront SS with the proper gravity.</p><p>It’ll turn out dangerous, if all you know is the miniature garden that is this Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>Know of the great ocean, little frog in the well♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “If I’m to be honest, I wish I can participate more in DreamFests inside the school.</p><p>Plans that involve other schools don’t count into the DreamFest system, so they do nothing to our grades whether we win or lose.</p><p>Isn’t this just you making us pursue exhausting jobs that don’t reflect on our report card, strangling us with a silk floss to weaken us?</p><p>Your methods are underhanded, as always.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “That’s your persecutory delusion. But this is unexpected; I didn’t think you were the type to care for grades.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “My parents like numbers. They scolded me because my grades have been falling lately.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. That’s how the world of adults is—the capitalist society is ruled by numbers, you see. Momentary passion will fade like a phantasm with the passage of time.</p><p>They all forget. So surprisingly easily.</p><p>What remains is results—in other words, numbers. My position allows me, to an extent, to manipulate these numbers inside Yumenosaki Academy at will.</p><p>You should be careful with how you address me. How about using polite language as a start?</p><p>So you won’t be insolent to our guest from the other school, how about I beat the rules of etiquette into you?♪”</p><h3 id="omen-3">Omen 3</h3><p><strong>&gt; Student Council Room</strong></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Here is your tea, Hokuto.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I told you I don’t need it.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “And <em>I</em> told you to address me politely. We’re both being obstinate, so it’s all fair. You’ll tire yourself being so inflexible, just relax.</p><p>You know, Hajime-kun from my Tea Club loves herbs; lately, I had the family gardener raise some for me.</p><p>They’re still of lower quality than those sold in stores, so I’ll have you drink them.</p><p>Perhaps herbs raised in my house are too horrid for you to put in your mouth?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t make fun of me. I’ll take it. (<em>Gulp</em>)… Hmm, it tastes like tea.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Because it’s tea. Anyway, Hiyori-kun is so late… He hasn’t changed, not caring about time. It’s becoming tiring to wait.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hiyori…?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Yes. That’s the person you’ll be partnering with for the Summer Live.</p><p>You should remember him. He transferred out at the end of the previous school year… but he was a student at Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>Tomoe Hiyori-kun, a former <em>fine</em>. I won’t allow you to say you’ve forgotten, Hokke Mask-kun♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…One of the two leading stars of the former <em>fine</em>. So he transferred out. Come to think of it, I haven’t heard rumors of him as of late.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “You should be more aware of those around you.</p><p>I know your hands are full with just your own problems, but being able to see the surroundings is one requirement of a leader.</p><p>In any case, he’s one half of the famous duo that was <em>fine</em>’s main force. His strengths as an idol are equal—or far greater—than that of mine…</p><p>You’ll be eaten alive were you to drop your guard.</p><p>You must’ve heard rumors. About the most nationally esteemed unit in our age group… the unrivaled, Eden.</p><p>They’re the strongest contender for winning SS; the unit that’ll become your most formidable enemy.</p><p>Hiyori-kun is part of Eve, a unit that is deeply related to Eden, you see…</p><p>I believe he’s the perfect opponent to test your skills for SS.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm, I’ve heard of Eden, but not Eve…</p><p>You said they’re deeply related, but in what way, exactly? It seems they both took their names from the Bible for some reason.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. That’s the funny part, Hokuto.</p><p>It seems Hiyori-kun’s Eve, alongside another unit called Adam, combine to form Eden.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Combine…?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Sounds like a giant robot, doesn’t it? I’m currently looking into the details by using the student council to gather data for me.</p><p>It seems Eve and Adam’s relationship is truly like a couple.</p><p>There’s a series of schools branched from the same idol agency, Reimei Academy and Shuuetsu Academy<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>…</p><p>It seems they have “Eve” and “Adam” as separate units, placed in these respective schools.</p><p>And sometimes, those two units combine into one and perform as Eden.</p><p>It’s not a very common method, so I don’t fully understand the concept, either.</p><p>Doesn’t it sound like a joke? Yet, they’re undoubtedly strong.</p><p>Perhaps even we, the current <em>fine</em>, are no match to them. Their business methods are tricky, but above that, their individual skills are frighteningly high.</p><p>Honestly, I can’t think of a hand to use against Eden right now.</p><p>So we’re going to deal with unmerged Eve and Adam one by one, in hopes we can find a hint to defeating them.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… That Tomoe Hiyori from Eve was a former member of <em>fine</em>, which means he was your ally.</p><p>Shouldn’t you have grasped most of his strength?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Well, those two were beyond my control even at that time, you see…</p><p>There’s also the possibility that upon transferring and gathering many different experiences, he’s evolved into an existence far beyond my imagination.</p><p>But at least compared to Nagisa-kun, Hiyori-kun should be easier to manage. The driving force of all his actions is simple, after all: <em>Nothing else matters as long as I’m satisfied.</em></p><p>Compared to Nagisa-kun’s slipperiness, that’s still easier to deal with. Plus, Hiyori-kun has the sweet mercy of nobility. Even supposing things take turn for the worst, well… he won’t kill you.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You always use such violent expressions… Hmm?</p><p>I hear footsteps. Is that not Tomoe Hiyori coming?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “No, this is…?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/GW9qrzo.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “’Scuse me~ Huh, is the meeting with Eve not done yet?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Good morning, Isara. Are you going to join our meeting?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Hey, Hokuto. What’s up? ♪ Awfully hot day, huh? I got really sweaty after all that working in the archive room.</p><p>Anyway, you’re Trickstar’s leader, aren’t you? I’m not gonna take your job from you. I just came to deliver the documents the President asked.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Don’t slave my comrade around, President.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “No no, Isara-kun was the one who asked if there was any work to do.</p><p>I didn’t wish to tire you Trickstar kids before Summer Live, either.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Well, I feel the best when I’m a little bit busy. And I’m just doing my quota as a student council member.</p><p>Here ya go, I’ll leave your documents here.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Thank you. Since you’re here, I wouldn’t mind if you join our meeting.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nah, I’ll leave talking with the bigshots to Hokuto and his nerves of steel. It’s going to drain the life out of a lower middle class like me.</p><p>And I haven’t had lunch, so I’m thinking to get something for my stomach.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Ah, it’s time for lunch already… I’m starting to feel hungry, too.</p><p>That cursed Hiyori-kun, he’s made us wait for too long. He couldn’t have gone home, could he…?</p><p>Geez. He hasn’t changed, still the same boy who won’t move to my plan.”</p><h3 id="omen-4">Omen 4</h3><p><strong>&gt; Arcade</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Noqf2G2.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ehehe. Isn’t it great your shopping went quick, Anzu-chan?</p><p>They do say that it’s better to settle errands as fast as possible. If not, you’ll find yourself too tired for the actual important job, and trip up over a careless mistake.</p><p>Just kidding; was that too arrogant of me… hya!?</p><p>W-What? Why did you press a cold sports drink against my neck?</p><p>Ah, did you expect some artful, exaggerated reaction from me!? I’m sorry I wasn’t funny enough!</p><p>Fufu. So because it’s awfully hot today as expected of summer, I should keep myself from being dehydrated… is it? That’s what you thought, so you bought this from the vending machine for me?</p><p>Thank you~ I feel bad that you paid for this, so I would love to pay you back; but I’ll take it as a tip for helping you with shopping.</p><p>Hehe, it might be condescending of me, but we managed to do our shopping efficiently and smartly thanks to me looking up shops on the internet, after all.</p><p>I’m so glad~ That I was of use to you, Anzu-chan♪</p><p>If all I could do was slow you down despite being the one to offer assistance to start with, that would seriously make me a useless kid who needs to be babysat.</p><p>I was panicked, though~ I thought you might need another pair of hands to carry the luggage since you said you were going shopping, but…</p><p>Then it turned out all the ordered items would be sent directly to Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>I’m glad I managed to be of some assistance at least with searching for shops.</p><p>Fufu. Now we have a lot of free time. Anzu-chan, you don’t have anything special to do after this either, right?</p><p>Then let’s kill some time until afternoon practice… and head to the academy together. Be there for our practice for Summer Live, okay?</p><p>Uhh, was that alright? Voice out your opinions sometimes, okay~? Is this fine? Am I not forcing my company on you and troubling you, Anzu-chan?</p><p>Umm, if you don’t hate it, I was wondering if we could play at the arcade together. But do you prefer that we go to a café, Anzu-chan?</p><p>Umm, so you know. In the Game Club that I used to be part of, there was this almost-legendary, amazing upperclassman…</p><p>He gave up on being an idol, dropped out, and somehow entered a video game company.</p><p>Yeah, that upperclassman I brought up when we were telling you about the past.</p><p>So apparently, that upperclassman finally finished developing this one game which planning was entrusted to him.</p><p>It’s the sequel to a popular title, so it seems the arcade has it.</p><p>It’s a title I’ve always liked, plus I’m curious what kind of game an upperclassman I’m acquainted with could’ve made… I was hoping to play that game.</p><p>Will you join me? Do girls not like games…?</p><p>Not true? Ah, your little brother used to love video games, so you often played with him, huh…?</p><p>If you don’t know the newer titles, maybe we should play retro games instead.</p><p>This arcade is filled with all sorts of those.</p><p>Look, there’s P<em>cman and G</em>adius and also Super Gu*sun Oyoyo…♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Oi.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, look! As you’d expect from Yumenosaki Academy’s territory~ They have crane games with a bunch of idol goods!</p><p>How about Trickstar goods… Hmm, I’m not really seeing them.</p><p>Good if it’s because they’re so popular they ran out fast; but most likely we’re just not popular enough.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Oi! You… Can’t you hear me, you Glasses-kun over there?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/JPmyhev.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hwe!? Eh, I’m sorry! Were you talking to me what could you need from me!?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “What do I need…? Can’t you tell? I’m talking ‘bout cash, y’know.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eh, eh?”</p><p>(Eeek!? What’s going on? Just as my outing with Anzu-chan is getting to feel like a date!</p><p>I didn’t think we’d run into trouble~ Getting called out by a boy who looks somewhat like a thug!</p><p>What does he mean by cash? No way… is he extorting me!?</p><p>I-If we can settle things with money I’d hand it over to him with a ‘sorry’ and run away, but! How can I be so pathetic with Anzu-chan right there looking at me?</p><p>But I can’t fight, and just by being involved in violence, my career as an idol will be taking a blow…</p><p>Rather, shouldn’t I just apologize and run away, before Anzu-chan gets in trouble too?</p><p>I’m totally fine being made fun of!</p><p>But I can’t let a thug getting near Anzu-chan and saying and doing cruel things to her!)</p><p>“E-Excuse me? I don’t have much on hand, but…</p><p>Huh… my wallet’s gone!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Yeah, that’s what I was saying: you dropped your wallet…”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “…Eh?”</p><h3 id="omen-5">Omen 5</h3><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/vpSaGqI.jpg"></p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Your wallet fell out of your pocket while you were teetering around making all that fuss.</p><p>I couldn’t ignore that, so I picked it up, y’see~?</p><p>Here. It’s yours, right?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eh, huh? Umm, if it pleases you, you can have it…!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Haa? Nah, I’m not <em>that</em> troubled for some changes~ Aren’t you misunderstanding something?</p><p>Wow, this is awful… do I seriously look like bad news? Doesn’t it kinda seem like he’s scared of me? It’s not like I’ll do anything bad, though~</p><p>Here. Your wallet. Money’s important; keep a firm hold on it. These days, money is what makes the world go ‘round, after all.</p><p>Saying goes that when you lose money, you lose your head.

Aren’t you Yuuki Makoto-san from Trickstar~?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Y-Yeah… Ehehe, have we finally gotten famous?</p><p>I have people I don’t know approaching me these days, it’s such a surprise♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Not really, pretty sure you’re still a no-name, from a national perspective. I’ve never heard of you until I dug out some info either.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eh, you looked us up? Why? I don’t get it but it’s scary!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Hmm~… On the other hand, do you have no idea who I am?</p><p>Well, I <em>am</em> the newest guy in Eden, and they’re such a flashy bunch I might be overshadowed in comparison, so~”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eden… You mean <em>that</em> Eden? Considered the top among student idols, the strongest candidate for winning SS!?</p><p>Ah… don’t tell me you guys are the one we’re co-starring with in Summer Live? Uwaah, matching up against Eden is too much!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “No, it’s a joint live not a match, and we’re participating as Eve, not Eden.</p><p>Hmm~… Judging from that reaction, doesn’t seem like you’ve dug up on us.</p><p>We’re being made light of, I see. Keh, don’t be so full of yourself just because you’ve gotten a little popular.</p><p>We took the trouble to free up some time in our packed schedule to come all the way here, y’know?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Huh!? He’s begun sulking! What a difficult kid…!</p><p>Umm, I’m sorry. It’s just we haven’t received any detailed explanation on the Summer Live, see?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “So you neglected looking up even a little about the people you’ll be costarring with~? That’s stuck-up.</p><p>What, are you some little chick merely waiting to be fed while opening your mouth?</p><p>You’re just setting yourself up as a perfect prey for us, y’know~?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “U-Uh… Could it be you’re… picking a fight with me?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Yep, we came from afar all to pick a fight with you guys.</p><p>It’s only half a year until SS. The struggle’s started since a long time ago.</p><p>You’ll be erased out of it in no time if you keep idling like that~</p><p>Well, whatever. Can’t be bugging on you too much, and I’ve got something else to do, anyway…</p><p>‘Scuse me for now. I’ll be in your care during afternoon practice.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, yes… S-Suddenly he’s being all polite and bowing his head? I don’t get this kid!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Kid… we’re the same age. If you keep makin’ fun of me like that, I might chomp on you, starting from the head, y’know~?</p><p>Anyway… Well then, if you’ll excuse me.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Wow, he really did salute politely and go off somewhere…</p><p>W-What was that? I was too panicked to think, but could I have been rude towards him?</p><p>Hnn? Huh, I didn’t notice that Anzu-chan’s gone! Looking back, she didn’t join in the conversation at all, did she?</p><p>Ah… That’s Anzu-chan! She’s walking over here!</p><p>Geez, where did you go off to~? We’re always telling you this but at least say a word if you’re going! No suddenly disappearing! I don’t like it!</p><p>This thug-like boy was picking a fight with me; it was so scary!</p><p>Huh? Oh, I see… You forgot to buy a drink for yourself so you went back to the vending machine corner, Anzu-chan?</p><p>Ahaha, you should’ve bought both at once~♪</p><p>That’s so like you though, Anzu-chan. Whew, I feel soothed♪</p><p>Ehehe. So how about we forget all of that and play some games? Let’s start with our objective, that game my Game Club senpai developed, is that okay?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Wait, there’s the boy from before! I-It seems he was after the same game as me…?</p><p>Aaah, Anzu-chan, you’ve inserted a coin into the machine?</p><p>Eh? ‘<em>You wanted to play with this game, right?’</em> That’s true, but! There’s the matter of timing and all…!</p><p>Aah, now we’re in! In any case, if we don’t play it’ll be a waste of money, so I’ll go for it, okay?</p><p>I still have no idea about the controls~ And that scary kid is my opponent!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Ooh… You’re challenging me? Pretty gutsy despite your looks, eh?</p><p>Haha, I’ll gladly take the fight you’re picking~♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No! This is just a coincidence <em>and</em> a mistake!

I told you not to creep up from beneath me like some kind of snake, Ritsu~…</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/k8Z0zJj.jpg"></p><p>No, wait? Sakuma-senpai!?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Yes. …Even though you call Ritsu by his name, how long do you plan to call me ‘Sakuma-senpai’ like we’re strangers? What a lonely treatment.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ah… Sorry. Is that rude?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “It is fine. I have not bestowed many things for Ritsu; at the very least I don’t wish to take anything from him.</p><p>…I don’t suppose you understand even if I say that, yes?</p><p>In any event, Isara-kun; you have practice in the afternoon. If you eat too much, will you not end up spewing everything out? Well, the young’uns process food fast, I suppose.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. I just have this frugal mentality, so when I saw they didn’t charge for larger serving, I couldn’t help eating too much.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “I see. Eat lots and become a big man.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Sakuma-senpai, you look sleepy… Well, it’s the middle of the day, so usually it’s your time to sleep, isn’t it?</p><p>But the cafeteria floors are actually pretty dirty, so you shouldn’t lie around down there.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Yes, but the season being as it is, it is too stifling to be inside the coffin…</p><p>While I was roaming over the school for a cool place that can shield me from the sun, I just found myself at this place.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “What terrifying sleepwalking habits… But wasn’t your coffin equipped with air conditioner?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “The little thing is being sent for maintenance~ It broke down recently when I washed my coffin.</p><p>I asked Mikejima-kun to fix it up for me.</p><p>That child is skilled with jobs of that nature; fiddling with machines, making musical instruments…</p><p>As to be expected of my successor. He can do anything if he tries.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Huh, he didn’t look the type… I mean, assuming he’s not dexterous because he’s huge would be prejudiced, I guess.</p><p>Anyway, how did you know there will be lesson for Summer Live this afternoon, Sakuma-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Kukuku. I know everything; anything there is about Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>To reveal my trick, however—I have the hobby of wandering around the garden terrace, you see.</p><p>Occasionally I would have a light exchange with Tenshouin-kun, who has made this area the meeting place for his club.</p><p>Tenshouin-kun appeared more grave than usual… He even sought for my opinion. Perhaps it would rain today.</p><p>In any case, as it is the nature of demons to answer when inquired, I bestowed upon him some advice.</p><p>I have many connections, including outside of the school, so I even became a mediator for him.</p><p>How curious, that a day would come where Tenshouin-kun and I cooperate for the same goal… I hope you would not let our efforts to waste.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yeah, we’ll give it our all. But it doesn’t feel real, that we’ll represent Yumenosaki Academy for SS.</p><p>It all feels like a dream. Until recently, we were nobodies.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “But it is real. You must advance with such grave resolve, or you would fail to gain anything, merely broken up to pieces as the storm passes through you.</p><p>Show your best efforts; we are here to support you.</p><p>Of course, were you to find yourself in some sort of trouble, you are free to seek my advice and I shall give it to you, Isara-kun.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Thank you very much, Sakuma-senpai.</p><p>In reality, we Trickstar still don’t have enough skills or name. Without everyone around us to help, we’ll be nothing.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Well, relying on no one does not necessarily make you strong.</p><p>No matter how great a demon, they will one day fall at the hands of the great mass that repeatedly challenges them.</p><p>Your opponent, Eve, is a two-person unit. You are above them in terms of numbers.</p><p>Plus, the Summer Live will be held in our home base. You have many fans here.</p><p>Take advantage of the geography, enchant the mass, and raise as heroes once more.</p><p>As protagonists of a story… yes? Do well, and I shall give you a pat on the head♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Please don’t treat me like a kid~…</p><p>Well, it’s not like we have the choice to return to starting point like in a game of sugoroku. Gotta pull ourselves together and advance forward.</p><p>That our enemy remains unknown is what’s scary. The president asked me to gather some records, but I still don’t grasp anything vital about them.</p><p>The leader of Eve, Tomoe Hiyori-senpai was enrolled to Yumenosaki Academy in the past…</p><p>I thought we would have data on his special skills, or his signature songs.</p><p>In reality, couldn’t find a thing even after fishing through the entire archive room.

That’s because that was how Tenshouin-kun’s group set it up to be.</p><p>During that era… Save for the protagonists, <em>fine</em>, and the evil they must defeat, the Five Oddballs—the rest of you were purposefully reduced to witnesses to the story.</p><p>Not given the right to leave the seats until the performance ended, your role was simply to shower them with applause…</p><p>It was a solid story, after all; and to begin with, protagonists have the unique power to move their surroundings in such way.</p><p>However, you children broke free from that curse and just once, managed to win against <em>fine</em>… against Tenshouin-kun.</p><p>Without letting the past heroes toying with you as they please—show us the power of you youths.</p><p>You have my expectations, Trickstar.”</p><h3 id="foreign-enemy-2">Foreign Enemy 2</h3><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Right, right. If I were to give you an advice… if memory serves, Sakasaki-kun devotedly collects even records that have been officially erased in his underground secret study.</p><p>You may go to him if you desire information, though he might ask for something in exchange… I will speak to him if he makes things difficult.</p><p>Also, there is no real way to cut off the flow of information in this day and age.</p><p>You may benefit from asking your precious comrade, Yuuki-kun, to search for information on the <em>in-ter-net</em>. Isn’t that child knowledgeable in that area?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “True.

Doesn’t matter, I guess. So Sally, how about we go running together?</p><p>We’ll only practice indoors today, so now’s the only time you can dash all you like, you know? ☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “No no, I just finished eating. My flank will ache if I run.</p><p>You’re energetic as ever, Subaru. Rather, aren’t you powering up by the day?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahahaha! I love summer! The whole world is sparkling☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Summer’s just starting. Even you’ll run out of gas if you start it with a dash, Subaru.</p><p>Here; if you’ve run to your fill then make sure to keep hydrated.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yaay, warm tea! I love warm tea☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. We’ll hurt our stomachs if we keep consuming cold drinks just because it’s hot, after all. Well, not that I’ve ever seen you get sick, though.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Yes. To be born healthy is a treasure. You should thank your parents for it.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? For some reason, Sakuma-senpai is napping on the ground! Hello, sir!</p><p>You guys had meal together? You get along well, huh~? Sally seems to be really close to Sakuma-senpai’s little brother… so are you two childhood friends too?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Not quite, we just had a fortuitous encounter.</p><p>Ritsu will sulk if I act friendly with Isara-kun, so I try not to cross the line… Not to mention there have been traces of him purposefully trying to keep us away.</p><p>I would never steal Isara-kun away from him, so he should not be so wary.</p><p>Ah, well. Ritsu will nag on me if he sees us, so I will take my leave.</p><p>I apologize for making you go along with my rambling, Isara-kun.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “It’s fine. Thank you for the useful information… Rei-chan♪”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Eh, why did you suddenly call me like we’re childhood friends? You just felt like it? To borrow a certain someone’s wording: I don’t get youths these days and their sense of distance…!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. Just kidding. You seem weakened from the sunlight, so if you can’t move, should I carry you until you get inside?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Do not mind me; reserve your energy. I still have no need for nursing, you know?</p><p>You too, Akehoshi-kun—stamina isn’t boundless… Think carefully on how you’d like to spend it.</p><p>That’s how it is in the world for the best. That is the sort of stage you now stand on.</p><p>Then if you will excuse me. The Summer Live is held during the day, and I may not be able to go to see you, depending on the weather…</p><p>But I shall encourage you from the heart, gentlemen from Trickstar♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah! Thank you very much for the encouragement☆”</p><p><em>&gt; Rei left</em>.</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha! Hey, did you see that just now? Sakuma-senpai grabbed a tomato growing on the roadside as he left and took a bite, didn’t he?</p><p>Do you know that’s the tomato plant Gami-san has been growing?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Wait. Speak in order; I have no idea what’s supposed to be funny.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “So, so! That plot on the side of the road was where Gami-san used to grow onions to take down Sakuma-senpai, you see?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Hmm~… Wait a bit, I’ll listen as we run. You were jogging in full speed until now; you shouldn’t abruptly stop like that.</p><p>I’ll join you, so you focus on cooling down.</p><p>I wanna work off my meal too, so I’ll have a light jog. I think I’ll be at best condition by our lesson time if I do some running.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, you’ll run with me? Okaay, then it’s a match! <em>Babyu~un☆</em>”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “No, I told you to cool down, okay? What’s heating up more gonna do for you? Even the sun will burn out one day, so seriously, think about how you’ll pace yourself.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh~? But Trickstar’s all about pushing forward to reach any place without thinking what’s beyond☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “I’m saying that method might not work forever… I guess that’s fine though, that <em>is</em> our special trait as Trickstar.</p><p>Let’s give today’s lesson our all, as always… Subaru.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You can count on me! I’ll be shining even stronger than the summer sun! It won’t even be <em>sparkling</em> anymore, but <em>sparking</em>…☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Honestly, you’re so full of energy it worries me… Geez, I’m starting to get excited because of your influence here♪”</p><h3 id="foreign-enemy-3">Foreign Enemy 3</h3><p><strong>&gt; Student Council room</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/MrZWLVU.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. I think I’ve grasped the outline of the Summer Live, for the most part.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Really, now. I suppose having the chance to explain things to you is one benefit to take from our guest’s late entrance.</p><p>If Eve—or more like Hiyori-kun decides to throw away this job, Summer Live won’t be able to happen…</p><p>We’ll have no choice but to cancel, so all this explanation may go to waste.</p><p>Ah, no, when that happens, perhaps I should have some random unit from our school participate as Eve’s replacement.</p><p>Judging from recent events, Valkyrie and Switch should do.</p><p>I’ll be able to unearth some inside facts about those secretive units by pitting them against Trickstar.</p><p>You all have the fervor that can bring out the wholeness of the opponent you collide against, after all.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’ll take that as a compliment. Even if I dislike how that makes us sound like poison tasters, or rather, human sacrifices.</p><p>No matter who we go against, we’ll never cut corners; we’ll fight with everything of us, without running away.&quot;</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “That’s what I expect of you. You’re still young, anyway, so without thinking too hard about the distant future…</p><p>I want you to make the most out of every second with determination—such that you won’t mind even if your fire were to die out this moment.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s what we strive for. Still, Summer Live only lasts a day, but the preparation period looks needlessly long.</p><p>I don’t believe constructing the stage and advertising the event should take that much time and effort.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Yes. While the Live itself is important, I want you to take care to interact with the people from the other school.</p><p>It’s your first interschool match; it must not be so easy to get used to foreign culture.</p><p>I’m not forcing you to be friends with them, of course, since they’re enemies you eventually have to kill, anyway.</p><p>The preparation period may seem long, but it’s only one-week long.</p><p>Get them to take you seriously during that period; I don’t care if it’s antagonism or pure hatred, make them lay bare some form of genuine emotion.</p><p>It doesn’t matter that your opponent is a senior, or a member of the strongest unit. Howl and sink your teeth into them and fight to your last breath.</p><p>All to seek out even the slightest hint to conquering Eden.</p><p>It’s in war that the true nature of human becomes bare. You should challenge them, provoke them, get them to take you seriously. Isn’t that your forte, Hokuto?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Am I really that confrontational? Akehoshi also said something similar.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “The fact you don’t realize that is both a problem and your strength.</p><p>…Hmm? I got a text from Tsumugi. It seems Hiyori-kun is finally coming.</p><p>We ended up relaxing and dwelling on idle chat, but you should straighten your posture now.</p><p>I think Hiyori-kun would make some really outrageous statements, but try not to be thrown off.</p><p>Counter his words proudly. Stay quiet and you’ll be swallowed by his one-sided babbling.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Ngz5LVE.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes, I hear someone gossiping about me!</p><p>Thank you! For thinking about me! For sacrificing a slice of your lifetime!</p><p>That’s the way, keep at it! Lift up the domination of your soul to Tomoe Hiyori, more and more!</p><p>Hello! I’m sorry for being late—at least I’ll leave an apology as a formality!</p><p>Why, it’s the man you’ve been waiting for! Here is Tomoe Hiyori of Eve…☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “……”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/w5oqkCB.jpg"></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Hey, now… What a big attitude coming from someone who arrived unbelievably <em>late</em>. Not that I didn’t expect it.</p><p>Can you at least pretend to be a little apologetic?</p><p>Anyway, your voice is as loud as ever. Look at how perplexed you’ve left this child… Hokuto, be. He’s making the face of a pigeon who’s been shot by a peashooter.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes, my loud voice is a born trait!</p><p>Since I’ve been born to this world, I shall take to assert myself with my all! I have a large lung capacity anyway, so doing so does not disadvantage me by any means!</p><p>Rather than that! Wow, Eichi-kun! It’s really you, Eichi-kun! Long time no see!</p><p>What a shock to see you’re still breathing…♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “…Are you dissatisfied that I’m alive?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Not really? I don’t care either way!</p><p>I’m not in <em>fine</em> anymore; not your pawn, right? So Eichi-kun, you no longer have much impact on my life—you’re a stranger!”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Huh. Talk about cheeky. I’m telling you this as a sarcasm, but: I’m glad to see you haven’t changed… Hiyori-kun. Once again, long time no see.</p><p>Thank you for answering to our invitation for Summer Live.</p><p>Come on, Hokuto, you should give your work partner a greeting or two.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah, right.</p><p>Pleased to meet you. I’m the leader of Trickstar, who will costar with you in the Summer Live… My name is Hidaka Hokuto.</p><p>It’s an honor to be able to work with you.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Hmm? Ah, I know I know! This is a joint live, right?</p><p>I’m not that interested so I didn’t bother to look it up, but I see… Trickstar, is what you’re called?</p><p>Hello! Let’s try to get along! I hope you would work hard as our prop, Trickstar♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Prop, you say?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Right. If just that much can make you angry, you’ll have a tough time forming a conversation with him, so swallow that down. First, since it won’t get anywhere like this, please keep your greetings <em>normal</em>.</p><p>But still…your boasting is as big as ever; I trust your skills haven’t rusted either?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ahaha! You’ve been acting so strangely condescending since we started, Eichi-kun! That’s funny, are you misunderstanding that you’re <em>above</em> me? How wretched!”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I’ll return the exact same words to you, Hiyori-kun.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (Wow, I can see sparks flying… This two were supposed to be part of the same <em>fine</em>, but…</p><p>From the looks of it, do they not get along very well?)</p><h3 id="foreign-enemy-4">Foreign Enemy 4</h3><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Anyway, Tsumugi was supposed to pick you up, but… I don’t see him. Don’t tell me you left him behind, Hiyori-kun?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Oh, I’m having Tsumugi-kun transport my things to the hotel!</p><p>I had a little too much fun shopping, but it was such pain to carry all of the luggage myself, you know?</p><p>Well, he has nothing to do with our current topic, so what does it matter? Leave that side character be, and let’s start our discussion as the main roles!</p><p>Okay, so I’ll lay down Eve’s plans for Summer Live, first of all!</p><p>If possible, I need you to move only as I instruct you to… as I desire!</p><p>That way, we’ll definitely succeed! There’s no demerit for you, is there?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Wha—Wait a second. What are you just suddenly… that’s too one-sided. This is a joint live, so we must work on even footing. We’ll try to be as cooperative as possible, too.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes, I’m happy you feel that way! But do you know only unsatisfactory results can be borne out of matching with those who are inept?</p><p>How unbearable were a Live that Tomoe Hiyori, that Eve participates in… ends up as such an uneventful, tasteless, and tedious piece of art.</p><p>We consented to cooperating with you due to instructions from our agency this time. To be perfectly honest though, I’d love to excuse myself from having to costar with minor characters like you all.</p><p>At least try not to get in the way, okay? I’ll kick you out of the stage if you turn out to be such an ugly sight.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “…Don’t look at me for help, Hokuto. I told you beforehand that he’s <em>this</em> sort of child, right?</p><p>Being your mutual acquaintance, I’m simply here to set up a meeting for you two and act as the mediator.</p><p>I’d like to refrain from getting involved in deciding the content of the Summer Live.</p><p>I can’t have you depending on me too much, really. Well, though if you <em>really</em> insist…</p><p>Anyway, everything starts from experience. Just try to deal with this by yourselves as a start.</p><p>I’ll offer you an advice, at least: if you don’t counter his argument with something, Hiyori-kun will selfishly move onto the next topics.</p><p>At least show some resistance before it’s too late.</p><p>Negotiate with perseverance, work hard so Trickstar can reap even the slightest bit of benefit.</p><p>The fight has started. Drop your guard, and it’ll end when he’s done exploiting every bit of you.</p><p>So that you can protect your precious comrades, Trickstar… No, so you can polish them to shine brighter—leave no stone unturned.</p><p>That’s your role to play, Trickstar’s _leader-kun_♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes, how soft of you, Eichi-kun! You’re taking the effort to explain every little thing to him?</p><p>I see you’re being a proper <em>senpai</em>! Wow, human beings really do grow, after all!</p><p>But it’s a little… irksome. I wish you’d leave the room, because this boy will be hard to manipulate to my convenience if you’re here.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I’m shamelessly attending your meeting like this exactly so I can prevent that.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “So kind. No—you really have changed, Eichi-kun. You used to have more spark, like how Nagisa-kun has been recently.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. It seems you’re still the best of friends with him.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Nah, I just like him one-sidedly! He doesn’t mingle with anyone; after all, he’s a child who lacks the function to love another human!</p><p>But well, he’s one of the numerable few… whose existences I permit in this Earth. And our affinity is unsurpassable, so I think of him as a lifelong partner.</p><p>There’s the agency’s instruction too, of course, but <em>that</em> is the main reason I still work together with that exasperating boy as Eden.</p><p>After all, I would refuse to stand, for even a second, next to someone I dislike.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Hmm. Well, that <em>someone</em> standing next to you probably thinks the exact same thing as you.</p><p>In any case, thanks to Hiyori-kun’s implacably late arrival, our schedule is pressed for time.</p><p>This meeting, or rather, the time you have left to talk face-to-face with him like this will run out soon.</p><p>Say something, Hokuto. If not for his agency forcing him to, he really won’t deign to converse with someone who doesn’t interest him.</p><p>Maybe you won’t get another chance at discussion.</p><p>If you have something to say, do that while there’s still time”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No. I predict talking will get me nowhere. He’s completely looking down on me.</p><p>Tomoe… senpai doesn’t seem to lend ears to those he views to be below him.</p><p>Then I must start from proving ourselves to him. We’ll show you what we’re capable of during the afternoon practice.</p><p>I’ll prove that we’re a beneficial unit to partner with.</p><p>That’s when any discussion is feasible. Isn’t that right, Tomoe-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes, unexpectedly enough, you can see through what is truly important! Most people would shrivel upon their first contact with me.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m no stranger to dealing with hyperactive weirdos, circumstances being as they are.”</p><h3 id="foreign-enemy-5">Foreign Enemy 5</h3><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/29zIlWo.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Hmm… What’s your name again?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Didn’t I introduce myself already? You should care to remember, since we’re partnering up, even if temporary.</p><p>No matter. Let me introduce myself once more—I’m Hidaka Hokuto from Trickstar.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Hidaka… Haha, I thought I’ve head your voice somewhere before. Even your visage bears some resemblance to him; you must be the rumored son of Hidaka-sensei, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hidaka…sensei?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I mean your father, of course. It appears he has a busy schedule, still being active as an idol, but sometimes, he’d be invited to Reimei Academy as a lecturer and take upon teaching.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Aah… My father doesn’t refuse any job offer as a rule, after all. That’s how he preserves for so long in the industry.</p><p>Even so, I didn’t think he’d take upon teaching in a rival school, when he’s an alumnus of Yumenosaki.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I heard he used to keep turning down our offer, out of respect for Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>I don’t know what changed, but around Spring, he suddenly decided to accept the offer.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Spring… Around the same timing our participation in SS was decided, then.</p><p>Why? Why is he training our opponents into stronger enemies? When he didn’t even leave a word of praise for me?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Who knows? Maybe he wants to knock his rebellious son down a peg, and reeducate him into an obedient, good boy?</p><p>I wish you guys wouldn’t bring your family problems to the stage.</p><p>But that person is a professional, anyway, so I don’t suppose he’s cutting corners as an educator.</p><p>In reality, he <em>is</em> good at teaching… So much that if he decides to retire as an idol, we’d love to have him as Reimei Academy’s exclusive teacher.</p><p>I’m learning a lot of things from him, too.</p><p>Interesting, isn’t it? The son and the student of the man who was once the top idol will be partnering up.</p><p>No—in SS, we’ll fight against each other with naked swords.</p><p>Almost like fate. Ah, how bothersome is that… I want to strive on by pursuing things that are purer, brighter, and truer to essence.</p><p>That’s what a fine weather is<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>…♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I don’t get it. Rather than that, I really want to fix up this plan some, since it’s looking too convenient for Eve.</p><p>We’ll need to negotiate for both our ends until our joint lesson in the afternoon.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes; that’s such a pain so I refuse!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I see. I’ll take that it means you have no particular opinion on the matter.</p><p>Then I’ll rework the entire plan to be favorable for Trickstar. No objections, I assume?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Eichi-kun, Eichi-kun! This kid surprisingly has some gall! I’m peeved!”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. Don’t think you can make him obey that easily, just because he’s younger. I’ve lost to them once, myself; you’ll find the rug pulled from under you if you don’t pay attention.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Eeh~ So many bothersome things to deal with… What a foul weather…</p><p>If I knew I’ll need to do some troubling negotiations, I would have brought Jun-kun with me and left him to do everything.</p><p>But well, I’m still Eve’s leader anyway, so I’ll do the important things myself without relying on the underling.</p><p>That’s the noblesse oblige, isn’t it? That <em>the King reigns but does not govern</em> is my ideal, though.</p><p>Reality never seems to go as we desire, does it? Ah, how vexing.</p><p>No helping it, in any case. If I’ll be doing it, I’ll do it seriously. And grasp victory, absolutely.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (The air around him changed. What a powerful glint. He talks nonsense, but he’s truly the man who was once one of Yumenosaki Academy’s protagonists…</p><p>He has the sort of majesty that’s undoubtedly worthy of his past title as one half of <em>fine</em>’s two leading stars.</p><p>I’ll be devoured were I to let my guard down.)</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ah! Right, right! Come to think of it, I brought a souvenir!</p><p>It’s already noon and I was feeling famished, so I bought some quiches off a pleasant-looking store I happened to encounter!</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/mMc8oV4.jpg"></p><p>I got varieties, so let’s eat together! Here, help yourselves to some…☆</p><p>Ah, Eichi-kun, will you pour the tea? By the way, I love salmon quiches, so I won’t give those up to anyone, okay?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Sure, sure. As you wish, Hiyori-kun.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Oh? What’s wrong, Hokuto? You’re slumping…?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Nothing… It’s just he eased up the moment I tensed up, which threw me off tune, that’s all.</p><p>This is hard to do. You were irrefutably my enemy, the evil, so I was able to challenge you with my all, but…</p><p>This time, it’s a joint live, and I still know too little about Tomoe-senpai… I don’t know where to ram my tightened fist to.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. You should let your power build up until the day of the Live, when you can finally strike him.</p><p>…Hiyori-kun, your taste in tea hasn’t changed, has it? I’ll prepare the one that goes along with quiche♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes, what hospitality! You’re as attentive as ever, Eichi-kun♪</p><p>A~an… Munch, munch… Aah, how content.</p><p>To eat the quiche packed with the things I love bite-by-bite is none other than supreme bliss. This is a fine weather♪</p><p>I wish everything in the world, everything in life, can be the just like that. That everything that blocks my way be pulverized and stuffed into the garbage truck!</p><p>Ahahahaha…☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (Aah… No idea why, but I’m so tired. Right, that’s it—it’s like the student council president has cloned. I can see how Tomoe-senpai was a former <em>fine</em>.</p><p>But if we’re talking about <em>fine</em>—we’ve won against them once, even if we owed it all to the people who helped us and the fate that sided with us.

That game’s theme song was sung by Eden.</p><p>Following that, advertising is sort of included in the contract, too.</p><p>So the staff told us to try out the game if we have time and put up a review on our social media or something.</p><p>Just as an extra service that doesn’t warrant being called work.</p><p>Either way, that’s still an important detail.

That’s wonderful of you, Sazanami-kun… But still, that’s amazing. So you guys sing theme songs for games too? Woow, you’re like a real idol♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “You’re an idol too, you know.</p><p>Well, Yumenosaki Academy kinda seems to raise artists whose activity centers on live concerts, which means the type of job you take probably differs from us who do multimedia.</p><p>Though, we shouldn’t keep chatting like this… We can’t afford to be late to practice, so let’s get a move.</p><p>I came from outside, so I’m not familiar with the area… If it’s okay with you, could you show me the way to Yumenosaki Academy?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Of course.

Even if you give us something, we don’t know what to do; it’ll just add onto our luggage~</p><p>And it feels like bribe, which isn’t very comfortable~… Unless that’s what you’re shooting for?</p><p>I only know the rumors, but word is that Yumenosaki Academy’s rapidly festering.</p><p>Heard they’re having their way with the industry through methods that don’t involve the students’ skills as idols.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No no, that’s a misunderstanding! True that it got into a somewhat unfortunate shape in the past, but we’ve gotten back on our feet lately!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Heh… Then why not prove that?</p><p>Talking is easy.

I was determining the course of action I must take before it starts.</p><p>I can’t make a move without gathering my thoughts first</p><p>I’m Trickstar’s leader. I must be able to see the entirety of things.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I can agree to that. If the one who stands at the top were to falter, that’ll leave those below him in disarray.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You are always so quick to speak about standing.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “You don’t like it? Hierarchy is important, though. Humanity is just one type of animal that lives in packs, after all.</p><p>Somewhere, at the instinctual core of our being, we seek to abide by a strong and righteous God.</p><p>Extraordinary efforts are needed to defy such instinct.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Are you trying to say that you’re—that Eve is—such supreme existence?</p><p>You gave us many ‘instructions’, didn’t you? Like you’re so great…</p><p>You did that when we met face-to-face for the first time that day—to all of us. Like you’re somehow above us even though we’re supposed to be equals as work partners.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ahaha. You don’t have to obey me if you don’t like it. But things will definitely go well if you do as I say.</p><p>While it wasn’t like I did <em>everything</em>, I was indeed a member of <em>fine</em> who once reformed Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>Even for just a split moment, I stood at the top of this miniature garden.</p><p>You should take your predecessor’s advice to mind, Hokke Mask-kun♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Don’t call me by that name.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Why? You looked far more animated that day, atop that stage, wearing a mask on you.</p><p>At your root, you’re… the submissive type of human. Rebellious phase doesn’t suit you.</p><p>Hidaka-sensei was worried about you. It feels disquieting looking at what you do, he said.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “My father has nothing to do with this. It’s my life. I don’t like strangers meddling with it.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Me aside, I don’t agree to calling your own father a stranger.</p><p>You were born to outstanding parents, so what’s so bad about taking advantage of the chance~? It’s enough cause for envy, really.</p><p>Ah well. We’re passing strangers, and we’ll be saying farewell at the end of summer.</p><p>But while you’re still in my line of sight—since you’ve been allowed to stand on the same stage…</p><p>I think you should try to absorb all sorts of things from us.</p><p>You’re a thoroughbred of the entertainment world; all the components you need have always existed in your blood. You shouldn’t shy from it; bring out that potential.</p><p>First, you should learn skills as I ‘instructed’ you to! It’s needed for Summer Live, so it’s a matter of urgency for you!</p><p>Let me see the product of that! I’ll pick at your flaws to kill time until the others gather♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…I accept. Prepare to be struck with wonder, Tomoe-senpai.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/sxsVBYi.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “……☆”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “……What’s with the delightful pose?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Wasn’t this your ‘instruction’? I have a downcast appearance compared to everyone else, so I should balance it out by being bolder, right?</p><p>I took that advice to heart and practiced it. How does my idol pose look?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Right… Looking closely, it’s not so bad, but I’ll subtract some points since you still look sheepish.</p><p>And your sense of timing was horrible. You startled me by making that funny pose with no forewarning.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I see. It was no good?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Oh no, it was fine. I acknowledge your effort… Continue your endeavors.”</p><p>(Hm~m… Just like Hidaka-sensei said: what an unrewarding kid to teach.</p><p>He possesses the capacity to accomplish anything, so why does he end up with such an absurd comprehension of what was taught?</p><p>How artless… No, perhaps this boy’s capacity is so massive…</p><p>That his entirety remains unobservable, and we can only pick up the visible components and judge from that… which makes him hard to be assessed with precision. That’s what this feels like.</p><p>Either way, if he could manifest the skill I ‘instructed’ him to until Summer Live, it should be enough.</p><p>I hope he makes it in time. …Well, at this heat, ice would melt in no time.)</p><h2 id="cheers">Cheers</h2><h3 id="cheers-1">Cheers 1</h3><p>&gt; <strong>Summer Live Stage</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/wOzgc0f.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yahoo yahoo yahoo☆</p><p>Today’s finally the day of the Summer Live we’ve been waiting for!

Subaru-kun is still young, so shouldn’t he be fine?</p><p>Instead, <em>we</em> should be careful not to be influenced by his enthusiasm and get ourselves too excited… Jun-kun♪</p><p>You’re still bad at pacing yourself, after all! You greenhorn! Ahahahaha☆”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “How come that you look the most animated when you’re putting other people down… Ohii-san~?</p><p>Geez, with Akehoshi-san here, the two of you together are even more grating.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes, being full of energy is a good thing!</p><p>Listening to his story, he seems to be shouldering a rather heavy past—that he can smile so innocently in spite of that, is it because he’s strong or just dense?</p><p>Well, that doesn’t matter! Other people can do whatever, but we’ll follow our own rules… We will simply perform elegantly, like we always do!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eeh~ Don’t be so distant! We’re here as comrades today, so let’s harmonize our paces! Let’s do our best☆”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes! I’ve said this many times before, but you all should address me in polite language!</p><p>Even if we’re comrades, we’re not equals~ I’m higher in status <em>and</em> older in age than you, so you should act meek towards me, okay?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha! You’re still talking about boring things like status, even though we’ve practiced together like buddies for a whole week?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “For <em>just</em> a week—right? It isn’t good to delude yourself with the thought that you understand the person you spent such a short time with!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Right, practice is practice, after all! Maybe if we can succeed together on the real deal, we’ll be even closer?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> (Hnn~… Akehoshi-san’s awesome. He’s conversing with Ohii-san normally~ Like, what they’re saying properly mesh.</p><p>On the surface, Ohii-san is acting insulting like always, but he seems to be having fun under that.</p><p>He’d often reject job offers he doesn’t like or cancel on the last minute.</p><p>But it seems he’s planning to see Summer Live through to the end.</p><p>Well, I’ve got no complaint if he’s willing to do his job properly, but it doesn’t feel like you, you know… Ohii-san?)</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Hmm? What’s wrong? I’d like that you refrain from staring at me! My face shouldn’t be anything new to you after all this time, right, Jun-kun?</p><p>Ah, don’t tell me! Does seeing me act relatively intimate with Trickstar members concern you?</p><p>When we work for Eden and stuff, you’d have a sullen look on you when seeing my closeness with Nagisa-kun, don’t you~… Jun-kun♪</p><p>Ahaha, so you’re jealous!</p><p>Don’t worry, don’t worry! As Eve, <em>you</em>’re my partner, Jun-kun! Of course, if you turn out to be useless, I’ll quickly switch you for another kid!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “…I have a lot to retort, but… you <em>do</em> realize you’re not being yourself, right?</p><p>Aren’t you being strangely excited? What, did your heartstrings got tugged by Trickstar? Did you get lost in the fun of playing friends?</p><p>You understand what we’re here for, right?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Of course! Rather, the fact I’ll have to take on an undesirable role hereon makes me so uneasy—that I’m simply running away from reality by acting like a drunk!</p><p>Honestly, Eichi-kun asks the most troublesome favors…</p><p>Perform with everything you have as if to crush Trickstar, he said.</p><p>Unlike Eichi-kun, I don’t make it a hobby to bully the weak, you know?</p><p>If I were to crush insects underfoot as I walk, my impeccable attire will be sullied! A foul weather…!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Kicking others down to no end, isn’t that the reality of the deceitful idol industry?</p><p>I’ve decided my resolve a long time ago, y’know~ On the day I enrolled to Reimei Academy.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes! To be unmindful of diving into mud is the nature of hyena—that drive to improve is one of your few strengths!</p><p>I might not dislike the thought of learning from your example on that point… Jun-kun♪</p><p>Fufu. To be honest, just spending a mere one week together… has turned me quite fond of Trickstar.</p><p>All four of them have their unique shine, their own radiant talent; they’re such adorable and fascinating children.</p><p>But that’s why… this spotlight is not for Eden, for <em>fine</em>, nor for Adam—it’s for us Eve.</p><p>Those other groups might <em>just</em> accidentally find themselves destroying those sparkling ores, but…</p><p>We’ll polish them gently as if to comfort them, and make them shine to the utmost under the summer sun♪</p><p>If the number of excellent idols increase, the concept of idols will achieve a great rise in its value!</p><p>In other words, it benefits me! My policy is to nurture anything that’s worth nurturing, even if they’re enemies!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Okay, okay. Well, we’re soft compared to those two from Adam…</p><p>Let’s defeat them <em>gently</em>, in a way that won’t kill them.</p><p>My condolences, gentlemen of Trickstar. Maybe you were beside yourself with joy just by being able to participate in SS, but life isn’t so easy.</p><p>I’m pretty fond of you guys, too.</p><p>At least we’ll rock you in our arms and comfort you, like a mother~…♪”</p><h3 id="cheers-2">Cheers 2</h3><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/qAi8OSA.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ooi, Eve! Sorry to interrupt when you’re having fun talking between yourselves, but we should do a rehearsal before the event starts.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. I want to see both Trickstar and Eve gather on the stage once.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “……”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/gq1dotk.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm? What’s wrong, Yuuki? You don’t look well. It’s a little too early to be getting heatstroke, right?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, no, I’m okay… Actually, I’ve been doing really well lately♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Your <em>‘I’m okay’</em> is too often surprisingly untrustworthy, you know… Does something about this affair disturb you? You’re making that kind of face.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, no… I’m okay. I think it’s just my imagination.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…? You’re always so withdrawn—never saying what you think.</p><p>We’re comrades, aren’t we? If something comes to mind, you should feel free to tell us about it.</p><p>It’s right before the show. While changing up the performance somewhere would be impossible…</p><p>We can probably modify the little details. I’ll do everything in my power, so tell me.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. You’re so serious, Hidaka-kun… Your expression has gotten stiff; are you nervous?</p><p>All right, let me reveal my special joke here to make you laugh♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Guys, stop the chatter and let’s rehearse. We have guests from another school here, so be good boys.</p><p>You’ll shame Yumenosaki Academy if you play around like always.</p><p>Our work partners are doing things properly, you know? Look at those two slipping into work mode…</p><p>We need to follow their example on that aspect.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “~……☆”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, you’re right. Ohii-san’s waving his hand to the fans who have gathered. He’s like a gentle-looking beauty if he’s quiet, isn’t he?</p><p>It seems he’s fully into his work mode: his aura utterly changed! That’s amusing~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Should you really be <em>amused</em>? We won’t be giving a good impression by whispering among ourselves like this.</p><p>At least let’s mingle with Eve.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “That’s true. Ooi, Sazanami-kun! Come over here♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Please don’t call out to me like you’re summoning a dog… We’re going to rehearse, right? I’ll do some warmups, so please wait.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, let’s do it together. One, two, three, four♪</p><p>You’re pretty well-built, aren’t you, Sazanami-kun? You’re like the action stars that appear in kung fu movies♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “What’s with the comparison…? Nothing to lose from building muscles, right? Though actually I’ve been gaining too much it slows me down, so I’m keeping it in moderation lately.</p><p>When you gain muscles, not only your body weight increase, you’re limiting your range of motion.</p><p>Also, Ohii-san hates muscles so… he’d be all like <em>‘You’re so sweaty!’</em> to me.</p><p>We’re not girls, there’s limit to looking soft and elastic when putting on fat.</p><p>So I think it’s preferable to build muscles. Ohii-san’s all squashy, y’know? His belly, for one.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Jun-kun, Jun-kun! Aren’t you spreading information that might smear my honor?</p><p>Remember that I can sue you! My family might have fallen, but we’re capable of employing groups of private lawyers, no problem!</p><p>Well, whatever! There’s really no time, so let’s quickly get the rehearsal done and over with! I’ll be taking charge, is that okay? I don’t care for objections♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Talk about controlling… Well, I’m still inexperienced as a leader, so I’ll leave it to you. In fact, I’ll be learning from you.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes! Learn all you want and be good boys, Trickstar♪</p><p>Then let’s get into the devised positions! Subaru-kun, Mao-kun, come over here! Hokuto-kun and Makoto-kun should go to Jun-kun!</p><p>We’ll be performing in groups of three.</p><p>Well, we decided on this together and practiced according to it, so there’s no need to explain it all over again, I suppose.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hmm~ Trickstar and Eve merging together, huh.</p><p>I think it’s easier for me to have Trickstar and Eve move separately, though.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I wish you wouldn’t bring up that argument again. Our numbers differ; it doesn’t look beautiful for a group of four and another of two to perform separately.</p><p>Considering each of our abilities and looks, as well as the songs we’ll perform in Summer Live and the audience that will gather… this positioning is, to my conclusion, the most efficient answer.</p><p>Well, just take my word for now and do as I say.</p><p>Your solidarity is enviable, but I think it’s refreshing to see you acting in separate groups for once.</p><p>Even separated, you’re still atop the same stage, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “True enough. If it means looking balanced, then I really welcome the plan. I mean, it’s <em>me</em> who always has to take great pains to keep these guys from running off to different directions as they like.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s how you truly feel, Isara? I’m sorry for giving you a tough time. Reflect on it, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh~!? Why do you say that as if I’m the insensitive one here?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> (Hmm~… Maybe it’s in my head, after all. Trickstar is acting normal, right?</p><p>For some reason, this Summer Live… Actually, ever since we started spending time with Eve, I’ve got this weird feeling.</p><p>Is it just because this is the first time we’ve had to work with another school?</p><p>I thought even if unbalanced, to make the most out of it… to pull through together to the end is Trickstar’s strength.</p><p>I feel like that ‘asset’ is being trampled on under the pretense of pretty words.</p><p>I hope I’m worried over nothing.)</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “? What’s wrong, Ukki? You’re wearing a scary look on you. Smile, smile♪</p><p>The audience have gathered! If you’re an idol, you’ve got to smile!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Y-Yeah.

My family will contempt me for getting along with someone from the Tenshouin Zaibatsu<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p><p>Until we’re dead, we still haven’t lost; so make sure not to let your guard down.</p><p>Myself aside, my brother is an outstanding man. He’ll definitely rejuvenate the Tomoe Foundation.</p><p>To help achieve that, I need to become a better idol and promote our foundation more.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. You’re such a family person. Maybe I should learn from your example, on that point.</p><p>But be careful not to push yourself too much and fall ill, okay? This heat is going to continue for a while… You’re so bad at staying alive, I can’t help but worry.</p><p>Well, I’ll gladly keep you as pet again when you’re left on the streets, Hiyori-kun♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ahaha! If you’re still alive by the time such a day comes, I might take you up on the offer, Eichi-kun…♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Ohii-saaan, the train’s coming. Stop that discomforting chat and let’s get going.</p><p>…Once again, thank you for the good work today, everyone.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup, you too, Sazanami-kun. If it’s not a bother, can we connect through social media?</p><p>I want to trade intelligence for SS and be friends with you too.”</p><h3 id="epilogue-2">Epilogue 2</h3><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Ah… I know your account, Yuuki-san, so I’ll follow you first.</p><p>But be careful not to approach the other Eden members besides us two.</p><p>One of them likes to set up schemes that make use of the internet, y’see.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ah, you mean Nagisa-kun’s companion. I hate how bleak and importunate he is, like a snake… Our strategy for Summer Live was partly his work, too.</p><p>Nagisa-kun himself is a calamitous man, so you should put up your guard.</p><p>Eichi-kun’s plan… is probably to pit Trickstar against Adam next, now that you’ve seen Eve.</p><p>But unlike us, Adam isn’t so gentle.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Thank you for the warning. However, we’re set to collide in SS anyway, so we can’t avoid them forever.</p><p>We’ll become stronger so we won’t get crushed.</p><p>Let’s meet again in SS, Eve.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Same to you, Trickstar… I’ll eagerly wait for our reunion. Do your best and survive.</p><p>Bye-bye, everyone. See you again…♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “’Scuse us, then.</p><p>…Ohii-san, carry some of your belongings yourself.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes! I refuse! Tell me, what were you born for? It was to carry my belongings, right?♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Uwaah… I thought he might’ve fixed some of that personality through befriending nice folks like Trickstar…</p><p>But not even a little bit? Just drop dead already.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “…Ahaha. They’re gone. It feels a little lonely, somehow.</p><p>We spent a week together. It’s not so strange that affections would well up, I guess.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yep. But anyway, we’re gonna have to face them in SS, so it’s probably better to not get <em>too</em> friendly, for the sake of the fight too.</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/fxd6ScX.jpg"></p><p>…Oh hey, Anzu!</p><p>Why are you so far apart? Come over here. You watched our Summer Live, didn’t you? Thanks for coming.</p><p>…Though we might’ve given you a pathetic show this time.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right, there are too many things to reflect on. It ended with Eve completely squashing us that we failed to bring out our strengths.</p><p>They didn’t give us room to do anything—that’s what it feels like.</p><p>Good that it was a joint live, but if it had been a match, it would have counted as a tragic defeat.</p><p>If you guys still have some energy left, let’s hold an afterparty while reviewing our mistakes.</p><p>If it’s fine with you, I’d like you to participate, Anzu. We’ll be happy to hear your frank opinion as a producer.</p><p>…What’s wrong, Anzu? You don’t look good. Is it heatstroke?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha! Then you should hug Hokke, Anzu! He has low body temperature, so he’s nice and chilly to touch during summertime♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t cling to me, Akehoshi. It’s hot… You’re being too cheerful, even compared to usual. Are you depressed over our overwhelming defeat, too?</p><p>Faking cheerfulness is unbecoming, but I don’t suppose we can keep looking upset, either. Let’s switch up our gears—our experience today will become the sustenance that makes us even stronger.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah. And if possible, let’s work together next time, Anzu-chan.</p><p>It seems we weren’t in luck to have you this time, but it’s when you’re with us that Trickstar can really shine.</p><p>I know you must be busy taking care of other units too…</p><p>But we’re always hoping for you to produce us, Anzu-chan. No matter when.</p><p>…Throughout Summer Live, you had the look of someone who was watching a public execution.</p><p>We really need to reflect on the fact we put that look on your face.</p><p>We’ll get stronger, promise. In SS, we’ll show you a great performance that’ll bring out your brightest smile.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Anzu, let me see that notebook. You were fervently writing on it throughout Summer Live, weren’t you?</p><p>Hmm. So you also reviewed the stage upon Sakuma-senpai’s urging, huh. You jotted down every conceivable point to be improved on and every imaginable way to produce us?</p><p>I see. You’re planning to produce for us assertively next time… That makes me very happy, I can’t ask for more.</p><p>You’re always welcome among us. Let’s get stronger together, Anzu.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Anzu~ The drafts here are design ideas, right? Are they the costumes for Summer Live?</p><p>We had to wear the outfits Eve prepared this time, so you thought up how our costumes would look if you’d designed them?</p><p>Ahaha! Your version feels a lot more like us☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ah, hey, don’t hide them. Let me see. …Wow, you really understand us best, Anzu♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> (Fufu. You guys really are close. That’s your biggest strength.</p><p>It was something we—the protagonists of the past Yumenosaki, the <em>fine</em> of olden days—lacked.</p><p>How enviable… No, it’s because you’re that sort of children that I want to see you win. I want to see you overturn this world ruled by unfeeling numbers, and show me a miracle once more.)</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “President~ We’re gonna do an after party. Would you like to join?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I’ll pass. It’s been so hot today, so I’ll go home and rest.</p><p>I need to make the necessary arrangements for your next ordeals, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Try to go easy on us, President.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Oh no, I won’t be nice. I’ll kick you off the cliff again and throw one bomb after another at you.</p><p>I believe that you can survive that and weave for us an unpredictable tale.</p><p>You did well today, Trickstar. But for better or worse, your fight has only just begun…♪”</p><p>~<em>(Edit) Extra things of note.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup></p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Daikichi’s name means excellent luck, great blessing, etc. It’s the best fortune slip you can get in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-mikuji" target="_blank" rel="noopener">omikuji</a>; you might have pulled it in the game’s 2017 New Year campaign.

Good that I decided to watch her just in case.</p><p>That freak is solving all the riddles hidden in the library. I’ve reached the right answer once myself, so I can tell.</p><p>If this continues on, she might find out the Phantom of the Library’s true identity.</p><p>Geez, this is what I meant! That’s why I said we should’ve hidden away all the books with the riddles!</p><p>We should minimize the number of people who know the secret! There’s no real way to button someone’s lip, after all!</p><p>Riddles are written inside the letters hidden in certain books in this library…</p><p>By solving all of them, you’ll be able to guess who the Phantom of the Library really is.</p><p>Fine if she can read the mood and turn a blind eye…</p><p>But if she exposes the truth to everyone for her amusement, it’s the end! Heroes of justice are supposed to keep their identity secret!</p><p>W-What do I do? Should I consult President Shion?)</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “……?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> (Eek!? She looked at me! It couldn’t be; I’m supposed to be well-hidden in the shades of the bookshelves!)</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/tyasnd0.jpg"></p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Yun, yun.</p><p>You are…”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> (…!? The smartest thing in a pinch is to retreat!)</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Ah, wait… You couldn’t possibly be…”</p><p>(Yun, yun. Aah, I guess it’s another miss.</p><p>The bizarre, the mysterious, the occult… Simply a sham? A trick? An imitation?</p><p>No. As long as there’s even the slightest possibility that a true abnormality exists, I won’t give up. Let’s search around a bit more… I have disgustingly plenty of time to kill anyway.</p><p>Studying, love, sports… youth. Use your time for such valuable things, says everyone in society.</p><p>But. As someone who should never have been born, whatever I decide to waste my life, to kill time doing… I doubt anyone would bat an eyelash.</p><p>Yun, yun.)</p><p><strong>&gt; Newspaper Clubroom</strong></p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “President Shion~! We have trouble!</p><p>S-Someone’s solving all the riddles in the library! She’s reached the final riddles in just the span of a few days, even though it took me months to do it!</p><p>If this keeps up, she’ll come in touch with us today the fastest! We need a counter plan! W-What do we do? What are we supposed to do, President Shion~!?”</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/GRaiw1q.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “(<em>gulp</em>) …Phew.</p><p>Aah, this tea is delicious.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Geh, Red Oni! Why are you here!?</p><p>The Newspaper Club room is a love nest for President Shion and I! Get out of here!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “…Don’t snap at me like that. How obnoxious.</p><p>It’s not like I chose to be here, either. The weather is clear today; I would rather play tennis outside.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Then get outside! Get out! Demons out, luck in~!</p><p>Let me throw at you these beans Grandpa gave me as snacks! They’re sugar coated and yummy, by the way!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Hey, don’t play with food!”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eek!? I got countered with a sound argument…!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Sheesh. Pipe down with all the quacking already. I’m not a real oni, but if you keep that up, I might wrap you like a manjuu and pop you into my mouth, you want that?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eeek! Don’t eat me! You’re scary! Save me, President Shion~!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “…Goodness.</p><p>Okay, so Fumi-san, is it? I was simply asked to watch the place for Shion-san… I’m not an intruder or anything, so I wish you wouldn’t be so cautious around me.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eh, watch the place? Is President Shion away?</p><p>I-I wonder if she’s on the rooftop again. Guh~ President Shion’s been engrossed with the Banchou lately.</p><p>President Shion – maybe it’s because she has a frail body, but she immediately takes a liking to strong people!</p><p>Maybe I should start training my muscles! I have to be President Shion’s number one!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Haha. That’s true. All day long… spent on reading, that can’t be good for your health. You don’t build muscles in a day, but…</p><p>If you want to do sports, how about joining our Tennis Club? Maybe it’s because I’m too harsh on them, but the members keep dropping, and that’s got me troubled.</p><p>I don’t really care about other people, but lack of members means our club budget will be cut, too… And we can’t participate in group competitions. It’s all sorts of inconvenient.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “L-Like I care about that! Just get out! The air feels heavier when you’re around!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “I can see I’m not welcome. I thought the Phantom of the Library is supposed to help students in need?</p><p>I’m in need of club members right now~ Why don’t you help a girl out?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Ah, right. For some reason, you’re in the know of the Phantom of the Library’s true identity, aren’t you…? Don’t tell anyone about it, okay?</p><p>Anyway, we’re not exactly philanthropic charity here! We decide who we want to help!</p><p>And you’re capable of solving all your troubles yourself, aren’t you!?”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Fair enough. At the end of the day, I’m all I have… I’m just thinking, the Phantom of the Library either has a lot of free time or a quirky hobby to do this stuff on will.</p><p>Anyway, if you need Shion-san for something, I can go and call her for you. I wanted to move my body, and you don’t seem to like me staying here.</p><p>Godsent idea, right? What do you think?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “U-Uuh~? T-Then call her for me! Tell her it’s an emergency, okay?</p><p>Me, I’ll go prepare snacks for President Shion…♪”</p><p>(Aah, I want to talk with President Shion, quick! I want her to blow away all my worries!</p><p>But… I can’t rely on her too much, right…? President Shion has a brilliant mind, so she always gives me the best advice; but she’s helping me out of goodwill.</p><p><em>I’m</em> the Phantom of the Library. I have to do something about this with my own power.)</p><h3 id="2">/ 2</h3><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “I’ll be off to get Shion-san, then.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Yes! I’m counting on you, Red Oni!</p><p>The deadline for the school newspaper is near, come to think of it; I’ll be writing my manuscript while I wait!</p><p>I need to polish it to a good enough state before President Shion reads it♪”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “…Are the Newspaper Club’s articles all written by you, Fumi-san?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Not really all of them? I write most of them, sure, but depending on how it goes, President Shion would revise most of it and turn it into something else, see?</p><p>But this corner for serialized haiku is something President Shion writes from scratch.</p><p>If you read just the first letters, or use some deciphering method, it’ll turn into an entirely different thing.</p><p>It transforms into a content that either criticizes the teachers, or supports those Troublemakers!</p><p>Nooo one notices, though. She’s so cool~♪”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Are you sure you should tell me that? You’ll be in trouble if they know about your criticism of the teachers and such, right?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eh? Ah… I shouldn’t have said it! Keep it a secret! Forget about it!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “No, I’m no machine, so I can’t forget what I just learned so easily.</p><p>Well, no matter… Anyway, I didn’t know Shion-san liked haiku.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Hmm… I think it’s not haiku she likes, but wordplay.</p><p>Encrypting, matching words or letters… President Shion seems to be skilled at that sort of thing, and likes it as much.</p><p>But you know, that’s closer to calculations than literature. I personally wish President Shion would write articles normally.</p><p>In literature, you can feel the writer’s emotion. I want to know more about President Shion.</p><p>Anyway, stop the talking and just go! I can’t concentrate and write my manuscript if someone else’s around!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Sure, sure. Bye, then. Thanks for the tea… See you later, Fumi-san♪”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Hmph, don’t you dare come again! Pweh-pweh! You’re banned from the Newspaper Club! And most of all, I don’t want you reading our articles before they’re published!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “It’s not like I’ll tell anyone what I read. I don’t really have friends… people to share thoughts with.</p><p>…Well, whatever. I’ll see you, then. Bye bye♪”</p><p><strong>&gt; Corridor</strong></p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/l6E70Uj.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> (Goodness… Now I can finally go to my club.</p><p>I might’ve been too stressed lately. The other members kept dropping out because of me, so I got too heated.</p><p>I need to show results, to make up for the kids who gave up. I’m being shameful like this; at least I need to make a face like I’m having the time of my life.</p><p>That’s the only way I can compensate… and it’s also how I take revenge on those who abandoned my beloved tennis as soon as things didn’t go their way.</p><p>Actually, I just noticed this, but… Because I strained myself too much during practice… Could Shion-san have asked me to watch over the club room for her so I could rest?</p><p>I didn’t ask her to care; and that’s too roundabout of her… If she’s worried, she should’ve said that like a normal person. What a difficult girl, for crying out loud.)</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> (Hmm? Is that a girl crouching over there?</p><p>I wonder what’s wrong with her… But, it doesn’t concern me, I guess.)</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “(<em>mumbling</em>) …I thought the sound reverberated in a weird way – someone must have modified the space where the fire protection equipment should be.</p><p>Pushing the emergency button opens up a secret path… Fu, fufufu♪ I wonder where it leads?</p><p>From the trick, I would guess this is those Troublemakers’ doing, though… Those naive goofballs.</p><p>So this is no mystery. Something realistic: a prank?”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Oooi?”</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/YPSe85Q.jpg"></p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…What is it? Don’t talk to me.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Well, you’re blocking the path, and the way you’re crouching, I thought you might be feeling unwell.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…Hmm, I see. So you’re purely worried for me? I can tell.</p><p>Thank you for caring. But I’m fine.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Really, now. That’s great then… Sorry for bothering you. Bye.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Wait.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Uhya!? W-What? Don’t suddenly grab my nape, that sent a chill down my spine! You have such cold hands, huh?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Really? Really… I didn’t know. I never touched someone else.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Nah, it could be my temperature was just hot. That’s my cell metabolism working, fufufu♪ ”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Whatever.</p><p>Anyway, I heard you were called the Red Oni. Why is that?</p><p>What does the oni part translate to, in your case? Spirit, like the original Chinese… in other words, the literal meaning of the kanji? Symbolistic of your rebellious nature? Or are you really some kind of bizarre creature?”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “No, just a nickname.</p><p>It seems I’m often called the Red Oni by tennis players from other schools. The Newspaper Club found it funny and made an article out of it.</p><p>My body is somewhat trained, I look intimidating, and I’m as strong as a demon in tennis… So they just tease me for it, you know? Look, I don’t have any horns.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Oh, what… that’s boring.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “You don’t come across interesting things that easily. It’s not going to come rolling to your feet. How about taking a walk outside since the weather is so clear?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “You’re like my mother… Unfortunately, I can’t accept your idea.</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/wlvKlt6.jpg"></p><p>It’s full of noises outside. I hate it.”</p><h3 id="3">/ 3</h3><p><strong>&gt; Rooftop</strong></p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Nyahaha~☆</p><p>Icchijiku-ninjin! Sanma-ni-shiitake! Gobou-ga-roppon! Nappa! Happa! Kusatta-nattou~!”</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/PX2Qrb8.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “…What are you doing, Gin-san?”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Whoaa, it’s Maririn! Yahoo, yahoo! How rare to see you on the rooftop~!</p><p>Nyahaha~ I’m lonely because we never talk despite being in the same class, y’see.</p><p>Maririn, you always rush out of class for club as soon as class ends♪”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Ahaha. We don’t need to be at school to meet; we could talk anytime whenever the local bigwigs gather for meetings. You haven’t been showing up lately though, Gin-san.</p><p>Thanks to that, I‘ve only ever been talking with the elderly, since no one my age was around.</p><p>I think it’s influencing my mannerisms and speech; I’m getting more and more like a grandma myself.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> &quot;Nyahaha~♪ You were always such a grown-up, Maririn!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “You, on the other hand, never stop being so childish, Gin-san… Only your body keeps maturing.</p><p>You should learn to be more elegant; you’re the next head of the Sanjou house, aren’t you?”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Why, I’m just a vulgar mountain-monkey through-and-through, y’see!</p><p>Anyway, don’t bring up my house~ I’m planning to fake innocence about that stuff while I’m in high school!</p><p>My freedom is gone for good once I graduate, after all~ Gotta enjoy my youth while I can! Nyahaha~♪”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Is that so? But I suppose that would be difficult to do, in Kimisaki Academy. It’s a suffocating college-prep school, after all.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Not quite true, y’see! I’m in the middle of playing with everyone on the rooftop right now!</p><p>Children will make a playground out of any place in the world~ I’m a child so I’ll have a good fill of a fun youth myself☆</p><p>By the way, we’re playing hide-and-seek today! The girls have spread out and hide all around the school, so I’m gonna find ‘em all quick and eat ‘em up! Since I’m the oni! Gaaaoo☆</p><p>You’re called Red Oni, aren’t you, Maririn? As fellow oni, won’t you help me find everyone?</p><p>We’ve got more girls taking shelter on the rooftop lately. There’s too many of them for me to find alone!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Nah, I have my club…</p><p>And anyway, don’t you start calling me Red Oni too, Gin-san. It’s making me sad; am I really that scary?”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Nyahaha~☆ The human brain is made to categorize others based on labels, no helping it!</p><p>I started getting called Banchou lately too, y’know?</p><p>I didn’t know what Banchou meant, so I asked this braided girl who has been visiting the rooftop often lately~</p><p>Since she always has her face buried in books and looks like the knowledgeable sort♪</p><p>And then, y’see? Apparently, Banchou is something like the guardian of the school!</p><p>If that’s what they’re asking from me, then what choice do I have besides exerting my best efforts? And being put in a position where I can protect everyone is just what I wish~!</p><p>Unfortunately for Maririn, you’re stuck with a monster’s name like Red Oni, though!</p><p>But hey, look at the bright side. It means you can be friends with other monsters!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “You sure are positive, Gin-san… Forget monster friends, I haven’t found a need for human friends. Ultimately, I can play tennis by myself, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Aren’t there tag teams and such? No idea, though! Nyahaha☆”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Hmm~ That aside, the braided girl you mentioned earlier… Were you talking about Shion-san?”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Right, right! That’s the name! Shion-chan!</p><p>She was among the rooftop girls before I knew it; when I first saw her, I thought she was a ghost or something!</p><p>I mean, she’s always in the shades, and she’s wearing the old-fashioned uniform from back when the old school building was in use, y’know?”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Hmm, so Shion-san really snuck among the rooftop residents. I wonder what that child is trying to do…</p><p>I can’t even guess; but you should be careful, Gin-san.</p><p>That girl, she smells like troubles… Befriending her won’t get you anywhere good.</p><p>Before you know it, you’ll find yourself moving just as she desires. It gives me the creeps… not that we should badmouth her like this.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Nyahaha~♪ I know what you’re trying to say, but I feel happier ending up nowhere good by befriending her, than not having anything to do with her at all!</p><p>I would rather feel hatred and pain than apathy!</p><p>Maririn too, you’re free to punch me when your stress builds up! Give me a deadly pain~☆ I welcome you anytime, nyahaha!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “I’m not going to punch you. Word of violence would ban me from competitions, and I don’t want that.</p><p>But how tiring. I heard Shion-san was on the rooftop… but you are all playing hide-and-seek? Does that mean I’ll have to look for her?”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Ah, no worries! Leave it to Gin-chan☆ I have a connection with this kid who knows everything about the school; if we ask her, we might find Shion-chan in no time!</p><p>Hello, is this the library warden? It’s Sanjou Gin-chan☆”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Library… Are you talking to the rumored Phantom of the Library?”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Yeah, yeah. Like you, Maririn, she’s given a monster’s name… Things happened and we’ve been getting along since.</p><p>I can only speak to her over the phone, and she camouflages her voice with a voice changer, so who knows what she looks like~ Well, I have a guess, though.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Gin-san, you’re sharp despite your carefree looks, after all… Like a blade, really.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Hey, don’t go calling a girl like a blade! That doesn’t sound like a compliment!</p><p>Say it more like, ‘You’re like a flower’! Or ‘You’re like a fairy’, come on~♪”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “No way. Where would you find a fairy who looks as tough as you?”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Nyahaha… Ah, hello, is that you from the Library? Sorry for the sudden call! I’m searching for this girl called Shion-chan; have any idea where she could be?</p><p>…Huh? What’s with the sudden coughing fit~? Are you sick?</p><p>Nyahaha. Usually, you’d know what I wanted to ask beforehand and ramble on. It’s rare to hear you being flustered~ It makes you feel more human; I’m happy♪</p><p>Hmm? I see, OK OK! Maririn, seems like Shion-chan is on the stairway landing right below the rooftop!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “I see. Sorry for making you go through all that trouble. You‘re a help’.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Hey, it’s okay. Let’s help each other in times of need♪”</p><h3 id="4">/ 4</h3><p><strong>&gt; Stairway landing</strong></p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Shi~on-san?</p><p>Hmm?

I thought you were some kind of earthbound spirit, or something~ And your panties are in full view.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “I’m not wearing anything that can’t be shown to other people.</p><p>I was actually hiding inside the locker, you see. But I felt appearing from there would be lacking impact from a performance standpoint, so I took all that trouble climbing on top of it.</p><p>By the way, I was hiding because I was in the middle of a game of hide-and-seek.</p><p>The darkest place is under the candlestick; I doubt the oni could guess I was right near the starting line.</p><p>It’s too much trouble to run around the school grounds to hide, anyway. It feels stupid to take this too seriously… and I don’t particularly mind being found quickly.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “You don’t seem to have enthusiasm for anything, Shion-san.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Unlike you, I do not have so much stamina at my disposal. I am a frail literary girl. I need to be efficient with my energy usage.</p><p>That being said–I could guess what you came to me for. I only need to return to the Newspaper Club room, right? Yet again, it appears Midori-kun has brought us another trouble.</p><p>By the way, I set up listening devices around the school and have informants all over the place.</p><p>Hence, I can read most of the tales woven inside Kimisaki Academy like an open book.</p><p>Still–I wouldn’t expect less. Midori-kun… the protagonist I chose. From one to the next, she keeps attracting new developments.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Hmm… You shouldn’t treat her too much like a plaything. It’s somewhat agonizing just looking at you… tricking an innocent, good girl like that.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Ah, but it’s instinct to want to pollute something beautiful… I would prefer you correct your wording that I treat her like a plaything, though.</p><p>I love her dearly, and I am granting all of her dreams.</p><p><em>She</em> was the one who said she wanted to become a protagonist – a special existence.</p><p>As a reader, I help her promote her status as a character, and make the story more interesting.</p><p>When you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. He who fights with monsters become a monster himself. Writer and reader… an author and their fan are no different, Hanaoka-kun.</p><p>It is an exchange of mutual understanding and love. She spins a tale, and I let her know my impressions as a reader. She uses that as encouragement to weave her next tale.</p><p>That will continue for eternity. A beautiful circle, an eternal loop. I am content; I’m glad to have met that girl.</p><p>Reality was so so so boring… I was so tired of it, but she opened the curtains to a wonderful tale.</p><p>Let us applaud. Anyone would want to touch and kiss the author of the tale they dearly love, yes?</p><p>Fortunately, that is possible in my case. And needless to say, I shall indulge in this chance. I’ll suck it dry, for her story belongs to me alone.</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/xMgfu7x.jpg"></p><p>I won’t let anyone interrupt my reading.”</p><p><strong>&gt; Newspaper Clubroom</strong></p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Hmm~…?</p><p>No good… I can’t come up with the next scene…</p><p>I’m doing my best since the Newspaper Club’s serialized short story has been received so favorably, but unlike Grandpa, I don’t have talent.</p><p>I wonder how Grandpa could come up with so many unpredictable twists like that?</p><p>His characters all feel so alive too; you get naturally attached to them just by watching them.</p><p>I love Grandpa so much that he influences my literary style, but…</p><p>It feels like I’m becoming a sham.

Don’t you think it’s like destiny?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Yes! It’s wonderful, President Shion♪</p><p>Let’s see, the newspaper’s past logs…? Ah sheesh, I should’ve properly collected them into scrapbooks!”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Fufu. We do lack helping hands. Perhaps we should recruit new members.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eeeh~… I want to be alone with you, President Shion. I don’t need a new member who’s better than a trash writer like me.</p><p>I feel like you’d abandon me, President Shion.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “You jest. I can’t think of a life without you, Midori-kun.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “R-Really? I see… Ehehe, I feel the same way!

The serialized short story is… it’s the chapter where a troublesome journalist tried to investigate the truth of the Phantom of the Library!</p><p>That’s awesome! I really didn’t need to say anything… My worries are like an open book to you, President Shion♪</p><p>Fufu. For the 23rd edition, I wrote as you told me and made up some great bullshit to sound like the truth.</p><p>Since this method provides a red herring, it might keep people from noticing the Phantom of the Library’s true identity.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Although I’ll argue you made it look forced. Midori-kun, you lack sensitivity for balance. Show, don’t tell; learn the skill to sneak hints between the lines.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eeeh~… But isn’t it good to be easy to understand? As a text to read.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Reading too deeply into the text is the thrill of literature, Midori-kun.</p><p>Anyway, look. Doesn’t the 23rd edition of the short story contain a suggestive line?</p><p>Build from that and claim it’s foreshadowing. Developments to bloom in the future are the seeds buried in the layers of the past; they bud on the soil that is the present.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Huh? What do you mean? W-Which line were you talking about?”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “This one. Look, can you tell?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “H-Hyaa… President Shion, your braid is on my neck, it tickles♪”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “I can guess. These make me feel hot as well; I suppose it’s about time for a haircut.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “You can’t. Everyone will find out that how beautiful you actually are, President Shion.</p><p>The only one who can get this close and see your real face… The only one who knows your beauty should only be me♪</p><p>Ehehe. Maybe I should braid my hair like you do, President Shion♪</p><p>We’ll look like friends with matching hairstyles… But the way my hair is, my braids get undone easily.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Midori-kun. Isn’t there something you should be more concerned about than hairstyles, right now?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Ah, right. I’m no good, aren’t I? I keep getting distracted from what I have to do… I’m just a dummy without President Shion looking after me.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “That’s not true. You should have more faith in yourself, Phantom of the Library-kun♪”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “E-Ehehe… But it’s like a dream. That I could act like the main character of a story. It’s all thanks to you, President Shion.</p><p>Hehe. The serial in the school paper actually bases its plot on real happenings in the school.</p><p>The teachers who aren’t the least bit interested in the children’s situation might have no idea, but any student can tell with a glance.</p><p>And there, I wrote in a fictitious character… the protagonist I thought of, the Phantom of the Library. A hero of justice whose existence is limited to the story; a phantom.</p><p>Then using the content of the serial as the base, I intervene and twist reality. Basically, I do what the Phantom of the Library did in the story.</p><p>That way, everyone will see the illusion of my protagonist. The magic to turn reality into a tale–this is my greatest pleasure as a writer♪”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “It’s essentially a one-man show, though. Not much different than what a conman does.</p><p>Humans live inside their episodic memories. We interpret, absorb, and read reality as if it was a fiction centered on us.</p><p>And there, you wrote in the Phantom of the Library, a character that doesn’t truly exist.</p><p>Because her story always fits with what happen in reality, few would catch onto the fact she is fictional.</p><p>Wonderful. To be both the authoress and the protagonist fulfill all the ego in a human. You are currently experiencing that philosophical ideal.</p><p>You were the author who created the fictitious hero Phantom of the Library, who wrote her tale… But you were also the very protagonist realizing the actions portrayed in the story into reality.</p><p>I would even say I’m envious, Midori-kun. Continue your good work; I have expectations for your next tale… as your loyal fan♪”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Thank you. I’ll work hard so I won’t disappoint you, my reader, President Shion♪</p><p>But it’s looking a little dangerous this time… There’s this freak investigating about the Phantom of the Library.</p><p>Solving the riddle on the letter hidden in ‘Phantom of the Opera’ book from the library leads to another book with riddle.</p><p>But these riddles can’t be solved unless you actually read the books. So with each riddle, you’ll end up having to actually read a classic.</p><p>Solve all the riddles, and you’re already a bona fide literary girl. And here I thought I was about the only one capable of solving all those difficult riddles.</p><p>I can only say this because it’s over, but… I was having such a difficult time with the riddles so I cried to my Grandpa and had him think with me, you know? Was this against the rules?”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “No. Intelligence, physical strength, luck and human relationship–all of these count as your own power. Think of having such a remarkable master author near you as good fortune… but still, this is quite troubling.</p><p>I do not know if you were just <em>that</em> out of ideas, but… the chapters of your serial have ben mostly named after the titles of the books with the riddles.</p><p>The first chapter, Phantom of the Library, was of course based on Phantom of the Opera.</p><p>Normally, if one solves all those riddles… they’ll come to the conclusion that the writer of the serial and the creator of the riddles are related.</p><p>That my name comes out at the last riddle is also a problem.</p><p>Anyone who wants to investigate the Phantom of the Library will definitely come in touch with me.</p><p>After all, originally, I simply wanted to have a literary discussion with any girl who read through all the books with the riddles–which were books of my choice.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Hmm~ Well, it’s not too late, so… we can take out the riddle from the last book, or borrow that book from the library to get rid of it?</p><p>Then at the very least, that freak won’t come in touch with you, President Shion.</p><p>The Newspaper Club’s relation is probably obvious already, so she might still come to our clubroom though.</p><p>We can only fake innocence… I’m the Phantom of the Library. I started this. I don’t want to involve you, President Shion.</p><p>I know that’s not very convincing when I’ve had you giving me advice all this time, though.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Your feelings make me happy–but you’re being distant, Midori-kun.</p><p>You and I, we are partners in crime… I do not wish to leave you alone to be dragged into a pot of troubles.</p><p>I shall aid you, so do your best to overcome this problem.

If you can go that far, you’ll be worthy of the title of the most leisurely person on earth.</p><p>I thought I might be able to make friends, if it’s with someone like that. And as a matter of fact, that’s how I met Midori-kun… It was all a matter of chances and luck, I brag.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…What do you need?”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Ah, yes. Discussions are normally banned from the library, but seeing as there is no one to scold us, why don’t we break that rule, yes?</p><p>Rumors had it if you make a racket here or treat the books without care, the Phantom of the Library will kill you.</p><p>Fufu. Well, people were so lacking in manners, that I couldn’t help but spread such a ghost story… It was my miscalculation that the fear ended up chasing them away from the library entirely, though.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “The Phantom of the Library doesn’t exist. Rather, it’s a fictitious existence you guys… the Newspaper Club made up, isn’t it?</p><p>You made me expect. I thought it was a true ghost story, a profound mystery. Like Hanako-san of the toilet, or kuchisake-onna… I thought it was one of such urban legend.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Because we followed the formula. Urban legends are spread through word-of-mouth, giving them a sense of reality people find easier to believe.</p><p>Not a ghost story woven from times past, but a meme spreading from person to person.</p><p>I wanted as many people as possible… to read the story Midori-kun spins. Because that is her wish. No; it’s the wish of all writers.</p><p>Though personally, I do wish to monopolize her story, all for myself.”</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/zTGCFIv.jpg"></p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Right. A story. A made-up tale… It’s nothing bizarre. It’s nothing mysterious.</p><p>The Phantom of the Library is a fictitious existence. A character from the school paper’s serialized short story.</p><p>On the same newspaper, there’s a corner that asks the students to submit their worries to the Phantom of the Library…</p><p>If it sees to the Phantom of the Library’s taste, they’ll solve the problem written in the letter… but that doesn’t mean that’ll always happen.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Realistically speaking, there are problems that are impossible to solve. Ones asking to kill annoying parents and teachers, or wanting a sex change to become a man.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “The Phantom of the Library has no bizarre powers. They can’t solve problems that require some sort of superpowers, or ones that touch upon the laws… that’s what it is, right?</p><p>Still, the Phantom of the Library solves problems. Time and time again… But they’re not doing a charity.</p><p>In exchange for solving your problem, you’ll absolutely have to obey the Phantom of the Library’s order once. This is the rule.</p><p>Disobey, and you’ll be met with misfortune. First, you’ll start getting phone terrors. Next, you’ll find unfortunate happenings around you. If you still disobey despite that, you’ll be killed.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Not that there was actually anyone killed. They usually got cold feet after a point and listened to the orders.</p><p>As the number of people who would listen to our orders increase… the next problem would become easier to solve, and information easier to gather.</p><p>Finally, any difficult problem will be solvable by our hands. By moving our chess pieces accordingly, using the information we have.</p><p>This way, the number of people who would become our arms and legs will keep increasing. And we have other special human resources like Sanjou-kun and Hanaoka-kun, as well.</p><p>We can easily solve anything; problems that would’ve been impossible for a single person to solve however large their efforts.</p><p>That’s how the Phantom of the Library is born. How it comes to be recognized as a bizarre existence beyond human understanding.</p><p>Its fame keeps heightening, and words keep spreading. The Phantom of the Library becomes a legend passed on inside Kimisaki Academy. It becomes a complete story, just as Midori-kun wishes.</p><p>And her bliss is also my wish. This is a love story that she and I… that two literary girls spin.</p><p>Of course, cute, foolish Midori-kun has no idea of the backdoor dealings I just spoke.</p><p>At first, all I did was give her advice and instigate her to action… I made it so she would settle the students’ problems herself.</p><p>But for better or worse, she’s clumsy and dull.</p><p>She kept failing… I couldn’t stand to watch, so I started working in the shadows.</p><p>She doesn’t notice. While staying ignorant to everything, pure, adorable Midori-kun… tastes only the feelings of success and happiness that come from spinning a tale.</p><p>She will keep believing that she’s the Phantom of the Library; that she’s the protagonist of the very story she pens… Without doubting that for even a second, she will enjoy her life and youth.</p><p>And that happiness of hers, her smile, they’re the best rewards I could ask for.</p><p>So you, who have been investigating about the Phantom of the Library–you’re an eyesore to me.</p><p>You made Midori-kun worry. You wasted the time and thought process she could’ve spent on writing.</p><p>I can’t turn a blind eye. So, say… Tokikuni-kun, is it? This is my request to you. Can you please <em>not</em> stick your neck into our problem anymore?</p><p>That’s what I came to tell you. There was no proof you would back down just by hearing our conversation in the clubroom, so just in case… I went out of my way to see you.</p><p>Can you do that, Tokikuni-kun?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…Of course; I’ve lost interest in the Phantom of the Library. You never had to request. I won’t come close to you.</p><p>Your relationship–that thing you’re doing for her… it’s sick. Either way, I don’t feel like getting involved.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Fufu. It is merely one form of love. I don’t particularly wish for you to understand or sympathize.</p><p>Anyway, I’m glad. You’ve given me a peace of mind… If you hadn’t nodded to my request, I would have no choice but to kill you.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…….”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Do you think I’m joking, Tokikuni-kun?</p><p>I’m serious, you see. If it means losing Midori-kun… losing the bonds I have with her… I would rather kill someone. I’ll beat you to death with this heavy Necronomicon.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “I’d hate to have that as my cause of death. But didn’t you consider I might expose everything you just said?</p><p>Just with that… just by her knowing the truth… your entire relationship will crumble.</p><p>If that girl you like so much finds out she’s been made to dance on top of your palm all this time… I doubt she’ll be happy. Perhaps she’ll come to loathe you.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Fufu. Come now, don’t make me laugh, Tokikuni-kun.</p><p>Let me ask this in return: how would you expose me? Who in this world would believe in the words of a <em>deranged electrowave girl like you</em>?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “……”</p><h3 id="8">/ 8</h3><p><strong>&gt; By the shoe lockers</strong></p><p><strong>Fumi</strong>: “~…♪”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Oh? Fumi-san, are you on your way home?”</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/9alkNz8.jpg"></p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Ah, Red Oni.</p><p>No, I’m still not done with my articles and novel… so I’ll be staying the night at the clubroom to write my manuscript and do the editing.”</p><p><strong>Mari</strong>: “I see; good work. I have a strict curfew, so I’ll be going home.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “That so… Hey, you’re sweaty. You must’ve trained yourself to death.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Yeah. As always, the other members just wouldn’t gather… I spent the whole time playing against the coach who was formerly a pro.</p><p>Unfortunately even the coach isn’t a satisfying opponent for me anymore.</p><p>There was just no challenge at all. I should’ve entered a school that focused on sports more… Enrolled to Adashino or somewhere else.</p><p>But Kimisaki is a school for high class ladies, so my future will be guaranteed if I graduate from here… was what my parents seemed to think when they forced me to enroll here.</p><p>They’re considering my future since I can’t keep playing tennis forever, I guess.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Hmm, you seem to have it tough too… Want some baked sweets?”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Oh, thanks. Are these homemade? They’re hot like straight out of the oven.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Yeah. I got a flash of inspiration, so I borrowed the Home Ec room to bake these sweets.</p><p>Hehe, aren’t I good?♪”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Yep. They look like the ones usually sold in stores… Munch-munch♪”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Hey, don’t swallow the whole thing in one bite! Think of the hard work I put!</p><p>I guess it doesn’t matter. Hey, have you seen, err… Tokikuni-san around? You know her, right? The suspicious girl with the hood!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Ah, we’re in the same class so I know her. I’ve seen her around multiple times today; she passed the school gate just a little while ago… I think you can catch up if you rush now.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Whoa, she was just about to go home? I guess it’s the school’s closing time, after all… I need to run. I have business with her!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “You’ll fall if you don’t look in front of you when you run, Fumi-san… What business do you have with Sora-san, anyway?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Hehe, what else does the Phantom of the Library do? I’m helping students in need!</p><p>The story I weave…will definitely conclude on a happy end.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Hey, now. While it’s fine with me as I know the Phantom of the Library’s true identity, you don’t know who’ll hear you if you say it with such a loud voice.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Wawa, sorry! That was stupid of me!</p><p>Oh, well! Sorry, Red Oni; I’ll be going on ahead so bye-bye~♪”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Bye-bye… Oh sheesh, what a restless girl.”</p><p>(Hmm~ Shion-san forbade me from telling, so I can’t say it to her but… It really seems she has no idea of the work Shion-san does in the shadows.</p><p>It’s unbearable to see, and I kinda have a bad feeling. No matter how masterful a lie, it’s fated to be exposed sooner or later, you know… Shion-san?)</p><p><strong>&gt; Road to School</strong></p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “(<em>panting</em>) I finally caught up to you!

What is it?</p><p>You’re… Ah, Midori-san.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Huh? You know who I am?</p><p>Of course you do! I’m a perfect, super-charming bishoujo, after all! The protagonist of the world! Fufufu♪”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…What do you need from me?</p><p>Don’t worry. I won’t come close to you guys anymore. I won’t investigate about the Phantom of the Library any deeper. I’m planning to not talk to you guys ever again, too.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eh, why? I can’t have that! I want to be your friend!”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…Friend?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Yeah! So I got an idea, you know?</p><p>You’re always searching for mysteries around the school, aren’t you? Like an occult fanatic♪”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Ah, I’m not making a fool out of it, okay? When I was a kid, I was a daydreamer like Anne of Green Gables!</p><p>Apparently, I often said weird things that grossed out the people around me! I’m forgetful though, so I don’t remember such a distant happening.</p><p>So anyway, we’re the same, you and I! I think we can be friends!”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…I don’t see any reason to be friends with you.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Don’t say that! Let’s get along and be friends! I haven’t been forming any new relationships since entering high school!</p><p>Well, President Shion would always talk to me, so I’m not lonely~♪</p><p>But still… you know? We can make it work, right? Here, I baked you some sweets as proof of our friendship!”</p><h3 id="9">/ 9</h3><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Ah, don’t ignore me and walk away! Hear me out, please! I’m sorry, you must be confused because I asked you so suddenly, right? But I thought this was the development that could lead to everyone’s happiness!</p><p>Hehe. So I thought about it, the reason you act so weird… err, creepy… umm… I couldn’t find a positive word for this…!</p><p>Anyway, so basically, like an electrowave girl? I wondered why you do things that make you look that way.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…….”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “You must be lonely, right? That’s why you do weird things, so people would care about you! It’s pretty common. That’s it, right?</p><p>You must want friends! According to my hypothesis!</p><p>I mean, it must be lonely, to be by yourself all the time, right? Sometimes when I spot you, I’d think to myself how pitiful you were!”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…….”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Because you’re lonely, you started doing weird things and got engrossed with the occult…</p><p>Which was why you got interested in the Phantom of the Library! That must be it!</p><p>In other words, if you make a friend–if you cease being lonely, everything will be solved!</p><p>The root of the problem, the reason you got interested in the Phantom of the Library, will disappear!</p><p>And I’ll be happy to have a friend, too! You’ll be satisfied, no one will be sniffing around the Phantom of the Library’s identity, it’s win-win! See♪</p><p>Ah, I guess you won’t understand even if I ramble on about the Phantom of the Library…</p><p>But if you become my friend, I’ll tell you! I’ll let you in on my secret, of course!</p><p>So you know, I’ll reveal my special secret to you! This means you can tell me anything too! I’ll listen to any worry you have! So let’s be friends♪</p><p>It’s happy ending, right?♪”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “…Eek!? T-Tokikuni-san? Why are you grabbing my shoulders? It hurts!</p><p>A-Are you angry? I’m sorry; I seriously thought it was a nice idea, you know? I thought I could save you from your pitiful state!”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Don’t take me for a fool.</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/9Zs7tAD.jpg"></p><p>Stop taking me for a fool…!”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “T-Tokiku… hya!? It hurts! You didn’t have to push me like that…!”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “You don’t know anything!”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eeek…!?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Someone like <em>you</em>! Someone so foolishly deceived and manipulated like <em>you</em>! Don’t you dare pity me! Don’t look down on me! You grate on my nerves…!”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “H-Huh…?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “I don’t need friends! No one understands me! Especially not someone like <em>you</em>!</p><p>Acting like you know me and calling me pitiful – don’t take me for a fool…!</p><p>Hey, do you know how it feels to have your beloved mother say you should never have been born?</p><p>That’s why I’ve been looking for a reason to say I’m glad to be born!</p><p>Do you know the pain of someone who has to hear any kind of badmouthing others do on the back?

It’s completely dark.</p><p>I followed my instinct as a literary girl to read any book on hand… I ended up giving a thorough read of the Necronomicon for the first in a long time.</p><p>I have most of the content remembered, but just by reading it on a different time, my impression on the same book could change completely, based on the experience and knowledge I’ve piled up.</p><p>So I can reread it many times. This is why reading is precious.</p><p>I’d wished reality could also be like that… Thanks to the wonderful story Midori-kun weaves, I can see that wish granted in the future.</p><p>What smooth sailing–I can’t stop the hand that itches to flip the next pages.)</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Shion-chaan♪”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Higya!?”</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/2PuXebw.jpg"></p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Ahaha, what a weird shriek~♪ Sorry, did I surprise you~?”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “…N-Not really. I’m fine. I was just taken aback, that’s all.</p><p>Erasing your presence and sneaking up on people isn’t a nice hobby; your style will conflict with mine.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “No, I walked up on you normally! Wasn’t it because your bangs were so long that they blocked your view and you couldn’t notice me approaching?</p><p>Why do you have such long bangs, anyway~? You can’t see in front of you well, right? You also have a weird speech style and wear a strange uniform~</p><p>You’re overflowing with individuality~ nyahaha☆”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “You are no different when it comes to speech style, so I don’t take kindly to being told that you… As for wearing the old school uniform, it’s because it’s a memento from my grandmother.</p><p>My grandmother was an alumnus of Kimisaki Academy. She wished that I, her granddaughter, would wear it and even stated it in her will. I am simply abiding by my grandmother’s wish.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> &quot;Huh, really? So there was such a grave reason behind how you look. I guess there’s no helping if it’s part of a will.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “I’m lying… So what do you need from me, Sanjou-kun?”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Hmm~? You might have forgot, but we were playing hide-and-seek, weren’t we?</p><p>I couldn’t quite find you, Shion-chan, so I’ve been searching the whole time, you know?</p><p>Now that you’re here though, that’s the end! It’s been a long time since I got to play such a fun hide-and-seek! Tell me again if you come up with another interesting game~♪</p><p>…You might be trying to make me owe you by telling me things though.</p><p>Next time, let’s play for fun without any thinking or hidden motives, yeah?♪”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “I don’t know what you’re saying, Sanjou-kun.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “I’ll leave it at that, Shion-chan.</p><p>Bye, then! It’s already late so I’m going home! It’s dangerous to walk the streets alone at night, so should I take you home~?”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “That’s a wonderful proposition, but I’ll have to decline. I am going to spend the night at the clubroom finishing the next school newspaper. Midori-kun and I will greet the dawn together…♪”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “What a pity! I got rejected~ But we’ll have many chances from now♪</p><p>Let’s remain friends… library warden.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “I would say you can’t trick me with wordplay, but that’ll cost this conversation, wouldn’t it… rooftop warden.”</p><p><strong>&gt; Newspaper Clubroom</strong></p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “I’m back, Midori-kun. How is your manuscript looking?”</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/63sjcUE.jpg"></p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Zzz… Zzz…♪”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Oh, were you asleep? Goodness, when the deadline is nearing…</p><p>You don’t grow, no matter how much time passes. That is part of what is lovely about you, I suppose… Hmm?”</p><p>(…This is? Midori-kun’s manuscript?</p><p>She wrote down everything that happened to her today into a story, like always. She remade it into the Phantom of the Library’s tale.</p><p>As always, her writing is immature, and she has no sense.</p><p>But it clutches the heart… This is what they call talent. You really are the granddaughter of that master author grandfather of yours.</p><p>But this story… Ah, how could this be.</p><p>So she acted upon the plan she herself came up with without consulting me… faced against Tokikuni-kun, and was rejected horribly.</p><p>Pitiful is a taboo word for her, Midori-kun.</p><p>Why.</p><p>Why did you selfishly make a move? Everything was going so well.</p><p>…That’s just natural. She had no idea I was working in the background. She even felt bad for relying on me for advice.</p><p>That’s why, without seeking for my advice… you did your best to think of a method to save Tokikuni-kun with your own power.</p><p>No, perhaps I had mistaken my advice. 23rd edition of the school paper… in that chapter, the Phantom of the Library tried to make a friend.</p><p>She deceived the journalist who was closing in onto her true identity, by pretending to be her friend… She directed the journalist’s focus somewhere else and misled her from the truth.</p><p>Aah, I only gave you that advice because you looked to be stuck on your story. Yet, you tried to reenact that story to reality.</p><p>You were convinced you could do it, when the only reason it went well in fiction was because the characters’ psychological state was as the author desired.</p><p>Reality isn’t quite like a novel. You were so naive you had no idea.</p><p>Aah, what a pure girl like an angel.</p><p>Right, that’s the sort of girl you were. It all started from a move of kindness.</p><p>She liked smiles, she loved people, so she tried to save anyone in trouble… that’s the fictitious hero you created, the Phantom of the Library.</p><p>Manipulating people from the shadows and threatening to kill when disobeyed…</p><p>The Phantom of the Library that acts behind people’s backs and makes a mess of Kimisaki Academy is already different from the one you dreamed of.</p><p>I’m… I dirtied the sparkling daydream of a pure, innocent little girl.)</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Zzz, zzz…”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> (Midori-kun. Your eyes look swollen. You must’ve cried yourself to sleep, like a baby… You didn’t have to cry or be hurt like this.)</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Hnngh… President Shion?”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Did I wake you? It’s fine to sleep, Midori-kun.</p><p>It’s better to take some sleep, even for a short time; it’ll make your writing more efficient.</p><p>Let me prepare your favorite hot milk. It will put you to slumber in no time… with the kind taste of a mother. It’ll also warm you up.</p><p>It gets cold at night, after all. Keep yourself warm and get some rest.</p><p>It seems you have most of your manuscript finished, anyway… I will do the rest.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Nn… President Shion, did you read my manuscript? What do you think of it?</p><p>I’m no good, huh? For the perfect protagonist, the Phantom of the Library to fail like that… we’ll get a lot of backlash for publishing this kind of episode, right?”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “I think it’s well-written. It does need revision; just leave that to me.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Nn… (<em>gulp</em>) The hot milk is yummy♪ President Shion, you always make this for me when I’m stuck or tired.</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/LItRnRP.jpg"></p><p>I’m happy. I feel loved. Aah, it’s so warm♪</p><p>…Sorry. I get sleepy after drinking this. I’ll go to sleep for a little bit, so please wake me up whenever you feel like.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Yes… Sweet dreams, Midori-kun.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Good night, President Shion.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> (…So she’s asleep. Now, this is where it gets busy.</p><p>Let’s rework the whole manuscript. By altering this serial that Midori-kun treats as one with reality, I can amend her memory of her experiences.</p><p>I slipped drugs that raise her temperature into the hot milk. Midori-kun’s body is unique in that she forgets part of her memory when her temperature gets really high.</p><p>Forget;</p><p>All the sad things, everything.)</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “…I’m sorry.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “…Hmm? Oh, she was talking in her sleep. That surprised me.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “I’m sorry, Tokikuni-san… for calling you an electrowave girl… for hurting you, for making you angry… I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.</p><p>I regret it, so please forgive me… I won’t fail next time… I won’t look down on you, I won’t make fool of you, so let’s make friends normally…</p><p>I… want to be friends with you…”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “…Forget those feelings.</p><p>Your friend, your special person, is me alone.</p><p>If you were to know that I hold such ugly jealousy unworthy of your longing… would you hold me in disdain?</p><p>Ah, no. If the time comes that you find out the truth, would you still… have it in you to not hate me?</p><p>…Nothing to gain by asking a sleeping person, I suppose.</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/SH1jTRA.jpg"></p><p>I will know the answer sooner or later. But if possible, I wish it would forever remain an unsolvable riddle.”</p>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Written by:</strong> Akira<br><strong>Timeline:</strong> Spring</p><a id="more"></a><p><strong>&gt; Arcade</strong></p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Yuuta-kun♪</p><p>Hey, hey, look at this photo booth!</p><p>By sidestepping and creating an afterimage, I’m tricking the camera so it would look as though I’m taking a photo with you, even though I’m alone~♪</p><p>Look! I’m hugging him and kissing him and doing aaall I want!</p><p>So how do you feel? If you don’t want me to be stolen by my very own imaginary Yuuta-kun, you need to jump into the picture yourself…☆”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Stop making a ruckus in a public place, Aniki.”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “It’s fine! It’s the arcade, after all; whatever noise we make is dampened by our surroundings! My playing around like this doesn’t bother anyone!”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “That’s not even the problem…</p><p>And speaking of, it says that that photo booth corner is only for ladies. Aniki, your longish hair might make you look like a girl, but even that’s going too far, right?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Long hair? But yours is the same length as mine, Yuuta-kun♪”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Being twins is our selling point as 2wink. We have to sync our appearance.</p><p>Well, maybe putting up our hair in different styles once in a while would be interesting.”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Eeh~ I want to keep matching with Yuuta-kun, though.</p><p>By the way, what’s that game you’ve been playing, Yuuta-kun? Fighting game?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Yeah. Lately they’ve all been pretty lukewarm in terms of difficulty, which is boring. Made for couples to enjoy together, or something…</p><p>But PvP mode at least gives some challenge♪”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “You do love your indoor games, huh, Yuuta-kun~♪</p><p>I prefer games where I can move my body more, though. How about we do air hockey together?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Hmm? Air-Hidaka-senpai[1]? What do you mean?</p><p>Aaah, air hockey… But when you and I play that, Aniki, we were always cut off by the time limit with our scores on draw, right?</p><p>Anyway I’m trying to concentrate. Don’t talk to me.”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Oh! Could you be having a tough fight? Yuuta-kun, you’re controlling this ninja-like character, right?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Yeah, I like the tricky type…</p><p>This guy I’m fighting against, I thought he’s the type that’ll just overwhelm his opponent with brute force by choosing a strong character, but he’s surprisingly orthodox… or more like, really good. I might lose for real.”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Ugh. Even if it’s a game, it’s vexing to lose.</p><p>Then let me go have a chat with your opponent and be a bother♪”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Stop that, Aniki… It’s just a game, no need to get all stubborn over it…”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Ooh!? Yuuta-kun’s opponent was Yuuki-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hmm? Huh? You’re 2wink’s… Hinata-kun, right?</p><p>I thought I was hearing voices I know. I didn’t think we’d meet at a place like this♪”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “I’m also here, you know~ Yuuki-senpai♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hmm? Don’t tell me… are you the one I’m going against, Yuuta-kun?<br>And here I was thinking why my opponent is so formidable~ You both are proficient even with games, huh♪”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Eeh~ When you praise us, it sounds like nothing but sarcasm…</p><p>I mean Yuuki-senpai, you’re only giving the screen a side glance while talking to me, but you’re still going at it like a monster. Yuuta-kun is getting thrashed…”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha~ I like games, you see. In fact, I think it’ll be too pathetic of me if I were to lose even in my area of expertise.”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Ahaha. Yuuki-senpai, do you come to the arcade often?</p><p>The two of us ended up with some free time between our previous job and the next, so we just came here to play for a little.</p><p>But unlike us, isn’t Trickstar supposed to be busy? Should you really be hanging around here?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah, well, we’ve been so busy that I haven’t had time to play through my favorite games…</p><p>It’s my first day off in a long while, so I’m using it to go around checking arcades.</p><p>There were so many new games added in while I wasn’t paying attention, I don’t know where to start.</p><p>This fighting game is the sequel of a title I like, but the controls have changed a little. I’m not quite used to it.”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Oh-hoh? Is that what you’ll say as an excuse when you lose to me~?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Oh, I won’t lose~ You’re pretty good, Yuuta-kun, but you keep repeating the same pattern. As long as I focus, I’ll be done with you in no time.</p><p>Look, a light kick. Parry, then fire~♪”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Nggh!? I-It feels weirdly aggravating to be played around by Yuuki-senpai of all people…!</p><p>You’re always so clueless atop the stage, though~ You’re just a small-fry in glasses so don’t be cheeky!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Ahaha. I’m good at blandly carrying out a routine I’m thoroughly used to; mindless tasks don’t demand much.</p><p>But Trickstar comes up with the craziest things to do every time, and that definitely flusters me.”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “…I feel like there are units out there that might fit you better, Yuuki-senpai.</p><p>You can’t show off that strong suit with a unit like Trickstar that almost constantly gambles on chances, right?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah. I hear opinions like that often. I like to surf the net, you know…</p><p>There are people who wrote things like <em>he’s dragging everyone down</em> or <em>he’s breaking the group’s balance</em> and the like about me.</p><p>Even so… I think I’m okay with being in Trickstar, even if I don’t deserve it. I’ll cover what I lack with hard work; I’ll get used to things so I can be useful to everyone.</p><p>I’m clumsy and slow. I know I’m still useless.</p><p>Yet everyone in Trickstar accepted me and affirmed me. I want to return their feelings, even putting my life on line.</p><p>Because regardless of logic, what suits me and what doesn’t, I love Trickstar.</p><p>We didn’t form a unit just based on calculation or compatibility, after all.</p><p>We chose where we want to live, on our own.</p><p>Aren’t you guys like that too, 2wink…? You could’ve separated and chosen other units more compatible to you individually.</p><p>But you chose to be together; you became the two-in-one 2wink, didn’t you?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Ugh, talking like you know…</p><p>Aah geez, and I lost at the game too. This is frustrating. At this point, no matter what I say it’ll just sound like a loser’s wailing…”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Yuuta-kun, Onii-chan will help you on the second round~! I’ll take the controls and the defense, so you just focus on the attack, Yuuta-kun!</p><p>With the two of us together, we’ll never lose to anyone♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. Normally, that’ll only leave you in discord and dragging each other down. But <em>you guys</em> might just show me an amazing combination.</p><p>That’s okay~ I’ll take you two on! Your senpai will keep you company for another round♪”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Ah, Yuuki-senpai in gaming mode seriously gets on your nerves! He’s acting all smug~!</p><p>We’re gonna pummel him, Yuuta-kun♪”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “OK, Aniki♪ See if you can block our twins’ synchronized attacks by yourself~”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. I’ll try. I won’t lose, not with video games.</p><p>Someday, even in reality, I’ll show I can say <em>‘It’s my win!’</em> no matter what situation comes my way.”</p><hr><p><strong>TL Notes:</strong> In case it is confusing,</p><p>[1] Hokke~ (ホッケー) is how they say hockey in Japanese–so Yuuta is probably confusing Hinata’s “hockey” for Subaru’s nickname for Hokuto, “Hokke”.</p>]]></content>

For the fool I am.</p><p>For the idiot I am, clinging ruefully onto a past now gone for good, remaining lost in it forever…)</p><p>“<em>Achoo!”</em></p><p>(Uugh, I’m totally wet from the rain… I’ll catch a cold like this…</p><p>Goes to show that even rain, a blessing, is nothing but deadly poison to someone cursed by God, like me…)</p><p>“<em>Achoo! Achoo!<strong>☆</strong>”</em></p><p>(Crap. My sneezing isn’t rock n’ roll at all.</p><p>At least to spit on the heavens that bestowed this damned fate upon me, I should sneeze more imposingly.)</p><p>“A-A-Ach-Clochette! Ac-clo-… Achoo!”</p><p>(I can’t do it… Seriously, what am I doing…? I’m starting to feel dumb…)</p><p>“Hmm?</p><p>O-Oi! What the hell are you doing over there!?</p><p>You—yes, you! You, the shabby-looking guy!</p><p>Answer my question! What the hell are you doing at that place!?</p><p>That’s—that’s the house of <em>that person</em>… my precious…!</p><p>Huh, what? You live there? In that house? What does that mean?</p><p>Speaking of, I think I’ve seen you somewhere before.</p><p>Aren’t you the idiot student council president’s errand boy? I see. Then you’re the guy she said was…</p><p>No, don’t mind it. Just talking to myself.</p><p>Swear to me you wouldn’t tell… err, your older sister, that I was here!</p><p>If you tell her, I’ll burn you to death in the flames of hell!</p><p>Huh? <em>That person</em>… I mean your older sister, she’s in the middle of an excursion?</p><p>A school trip? Huh, so it’s the season for that at the other school…</p><p>That’s okay then. I guess I really came here for nothing.</p><p>My fate and <em>that person</em>’s seem to be broken apart forever, after all.</p><p>Never to cross… Achoo☆</p><p>Huh? N-No, I’m fine! Don’t worry about me!</p><p>I am a wingless Lucifer—all things in existence God created only hurt…</p><p>Eek!? Don’t grab my hand and pull me!</p><p>What!? You’ll lend me a set of clothes to change into, an umbrella, and a cold medicine? No one asked you to!</p><p>Ugh, your forcefulness is exactly just like <em>that person</em>’s!</p><p>Aargh, geez…!”</p><p><strong>Into the house</strong></p><p><strong>&gt; House</strong></p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> (In the end, he forcefully brought me inside the house…</p><p>Damn it, to think I end up having to rely on another person…!</p><p>Know this: I’ll never say thank you! ‘Cuz I’m a rebel!</p><p>But to be honest, I might be grateful.</p><p>Basking in hot shower seriously brought me back to life.</p><p>So, about the change of clothes… Is this it?</p><p>It’s our school uniform… but it’s not mine, I think…?</p><p>Why does he have something like this with him?</p><p>Well, no need to look too deeply into it.</p><p>Hmm? Huh!? My eyepatch isn’t here!)</p><p>“Y-You bastard…!</p><p>Where did you hide my eyepatch!?</p><p>Eh? It was ruined by the rain, so you threw it away?</p><p>What do you think you’re doing!? Without that, I’m…!</p><p>Eek! Don’t look! Don’t look at my cursed face!</p><p><img alt="Dolce Suzu" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/LETmnst.jpg"></p><p>Uuu…! Nooo! Don’t look at me! Uwaaaa~!</p><p>(<em>sniff</em>) (<em>hic</em>) Uwaaaa…!”</p><h3 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h3><p><strong>&gt; House</strong></p><p><img alt="Dolce Suzu" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/bAsTE3E.jpg"></p><p><strong>Suzu:</strong> “…Sorry for kicking a fuss.</p><p>I’m hopeless without my eyepatch…</p><p>My eyepatch hides under it the proof of the wingless Lucifer — the mark of sin!</p><p>And it now aches, torturing my soul…!</p><p>You fear it too, don’t you? It’s fine to be afraid.</p><p>Such reaction is natural coming from the clay descendants created by that hateful God!</p><p>Huh? You’re not afraid? In fact, you find it magical and captivating…?</p><p>D-Don’t be stupid! Your joke is not funny at all! E-ehehe…♪</p><p>W-Well, that aside. I guess it would’ve been annoying if you’d gotten afraid.</p><p>Haha, you two really are siblings. You’re just like that person.</p><p>When I look at you, I recall it; my first meeting with that person.</p><p>I’ve always loathed this proof of sin carved onto my face.</p><p>When they see my face, everyone grimaces and steps away from me.</p><p>Ever since I was born, I’ve been repeatedly reminded of how different I am compared to others.</p><p>Always, <em>always</em>…</p><p>Everyone feels uneasy when they see me.</p><p>They became confused, afraid; they condemn, for they can’t understand.</p><p>When I was a child, I had naturally wished to be loved by my parents and everyone.</p><p>But whenever I got close, that only distressed the other person.</p><p>That’s all that ever happened to me.</p><p>No one understood me. So finally, I gave up. I lived in the shadow.</p><p>Hiding so no one would see me, so they wouldn’t get scared of me… I was just like air…</p><p>But then your sister called out to me.</p><p>I remember.</p><p>I was alone like always when I just enrolled to high school, but your sister came up to me and talked to me tirelessly.</p><p>I thought she was doing that for her own amusement. That’s why I didn’t react kindly at first.</p><p>I cursed at her, spat at her and pushed her away.</p><p>Because everyone — when they come close enough to see my face — <em>everyone</em> becomes afraid and hurts me!</p><p>But she didn’t falter. She approached me every day.</p><p>No matter how hard I tried to distance myself from her, it didn’t work.</p><p>One day, I started feeling silly for all of it…</p><p>I gradually started to look forward to when she would talk to me.</p><p>She’s a reckless one. She’s probably an idiot.</p><p>But that’s what makes her so honest and pure.</p><p>She praised this face of mine;</p><p>With all the innocence and genuineness of a child who found something pretty.</p><p><em>You’re so cute. It looks so magical. I’m jealous,</em> she said.</p><p>That was the first time ever since I was born that someone said something like that to me.</p><p>It made me so happy, so I stopped stubbornly pushing her away.</p><p>Even if we would have to part someday, I wanted to be by her side.</p><p>I liked her…</p><p>But then she parted from me.</p><p>Due to circumstances I couldn’t do anything about…</p><p>I lost my warm place to be.</p><p>Since then, I came to hate everything. I loathed the world.</p><p>It was only after she parted from me, that I noticed for the first time;</p><p>My heart was filled with her existence. I was content and blissful.</p><p>But I’ve lost that forever, and become empty.</p><p>To erase the hollowness,</p><p>I hurt my surroundings, taking revenge on everything that had taken her away from me.</p><p>In the end, while she might have praised it, this face of mine is a proof of sin.</p><p>I should have never existed in this world; I’m a child of evil… I’m sure of it.</p><p>Hmm? Hey, are you listening? What have you been doing since a while ago?</p><p>What’s that? A CD? Are you going to play a song?</p><p>This… is…? It’s my song?</p><p>Ah, it’s the CD that’s sold in the school, right?</p><p>It’s the one our members sold to gather budget for the club…</p><p>Why do you have it? D-Do you like my songs?</p><p>Eh? Your sister told you to buy one?</p><p>I see. So that person is listening…</p><p>Listening to my songs. We’re still connected through these songs…</p><p>Hmm? This is…?</p><p>You searched for something that can replace my eyepatch in that person’s room, and you found this?</p><p>Is this a costume for concerts? Whoa, it fits me!</p><p>That’s right. She was also the first one to have praised my song.</p><p>She introduced me to the Rock Band Club and even made me costumes. That person was skilled with her fingers.</p><p>…So she’s still supporting me, even now.</p><p>Can I put this on? Right now, I really feel like singing while wearing this!</p><p>I’ll let you listen from the VIP seat.</p><p>This is my song, a song of my gratitude towards that person!</p><p>It’s okay, I have my guitar with me.</p><p>I hope it didn’t get wet from the rain… Okay, seems not. Good I put it inside the case. Okay, all ready!</p><p><img alt="Dolce Suzu" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/L8qKlOg.jpg"></p><p>What do you think? Does it look good on me?</p><p>Of course, since it’s the costume that person made especially for me!</p><p>Fuhahahaha…!</p><p>She and I parted. Perhaps our paths will never cross again.</p><p>But my song can reach. It will definitely reach! I’m sure of it.</p><p>It’ll clear through every evil that stands in its way, piercing through the fate that the hateful God has planned…!</p><p>You should listen to my song too.</p><p>When I’m next to you, I remember;</p><p>Those most blissful times of mine, when I was together with her.</p><p>Thank you, Otouto-kun.</p><p>Just like her, I’m sure you’ll come to save a lot of people’s hearts.</p><p>The same way you’ve enlightened mine right now, even if just a bit.</p><p>~♪”</p>]]></content>

I can’t run anymore! Break time!&quot;</p><p>(My stamina has really taken a blow…</p><p>Trickstar has been at the top of its popularity lately—I might’ve took it too much for the ride, even more than I realized.</p><p>Ah, no. Maybe I was unconsciously putting on brakes… because if we get too popular, things might end up like back when I was a kid model.</p><p>If that’s what this is, then I’m hopeless. I haven’t changed, neither have I grown…</p><p>I should have been reborn as a new me, thanks to everyone in Trickstar and Transfer student-chan—and yet.</p><p>If I come to a standstill here, I’ll just be repeating history.)</p><p>&quot;…All right. I’ll give it another shot, with my all.</p><p>First, let’s start by building some stamina, like Oogami-kun told me!</p><p>A few more laps around the sports grounds, then I’ll move onto muscle training! Until the Spring Music Festival starts, I should at least restore the same amount of strength I’ve lost!</p><p>Go for it, Makoto! Don’t lose, Makoto! Hip-hip-hurray! ♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> “Oh? Yuuki-kun, what are you doing over there?”</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/A23Ndsr.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Wahya!?</p><p>Ah—Ooh… It’s you, Narukami-kun. Hello♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Hello~♪</p><p>Ufufu. You address me like a stranger. Instead of ‘Narukami-kun’, going with ‘Arashi’ is fine, you know? ‘Onee-chan’ or ‘Naruko-chan’ are also welcome♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Mm… Things have gotten a little perilous between Trickstar and Knights after DDD a while back, so…</p><p>Wouldn’t it be bad for us to call each other by nicknames and act like we’re friends?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Oh, you speak of the topic like it’s not your problem. But anyway, I’d like to have the sports grounds cleared so I can clean up…</p><p>It’s about time for the school to close, too. Can you do some yoga at home instead if you really want to do sports?&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Ah, sorry; it’s already that late…?</p><p>Narukami-kun, so you were cleaning after the sports grounds.</p><p>Is it an ‘on-campus part time’? I heard Knights has been doing nothing but that recently…&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Nuh-huh. I’m part of the Track Club, you see.</p><p>Club activities are mostly on break before the school festival, but I have my reason to be training and getting my body to shape.</p><p>So I took the initiative to do some jogging and stuffs. In our Track Club, there’s rule that the person who uses the sports grounds last has to clean up♪</p><p>But that aside, you can’t be sprawling at a place like this!</p><p>It’s still pretty chilly; you might catch a cold. Not to mention, you’ll dirty your clothes.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, that’s okay! It’s just jersey, anyway! The sort of clothes I don’t mind dirtying♪”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;No, no. That doesn’t make it any less of a handful to wash, right?</p><p>Jerseys might be long-lasting, but you have to take care of your clothes, or they’ll soon go to waste.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I guess that’s true. Ahaha, Narukami-kun, you say the exact same things as Izumi-san.”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Well, I talk to him the most in the unit. I’ve known him for pretty long too, so it can’t be helped that I took some of his habits.</p><p>You, though, aren’t like Izumi-chan at all, are you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Nope… He took care of me in the past, but we were separated for longer. Even if he influenced me some, they’re probably erased with time.”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;That makes him sound like a contaminant. He’ll be furious to hear that, you know. Heavens forbid that♪</p><p>…Please don’t hate Izumi-chan too much, if you can.</p><p>I don’t think he’s such a weakling a little mental stress leaves him in disorder, but I still feel sorry, when I see him.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Uh, rather than hating him, I’m scared because I don’t get him… Why is that person so insistent on getting involved with me?</p><p>Even though he was cruel enough to lock me up…</p><p>He just casually appeared in front of my house in the morning and said, _Yuu-kuuun, let’s go to school together_♪, you know? That’s practically psychopathic!</p><p>I don’t get him. Really. I don’t know how you can get along okay with that person, Narukami-kun.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Oh, I’m not okay, believe me. He drives me nuts♪</p><p>Wait, now it sounds like we’re talking behind his back.</p><p>My, this isn’t good… Recently, I’ve been doing nothing but volunteers to restore Knights’ name; it must be the pent-up stress getting to me.</p><p>Well, we’re reaping what we sown. Ah geez, this is bad for my skin…</p><p>At least on the day of the Fashion Show, I want to look more beautiful than anyone else.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Aah, I heard Knights is participating on the Fashion Show for the Festival Eve, is that right?</p><p>Izumi-san said something like _Yuu-kun, let’s walk on the runway together_♪, so I know.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;No; rather than Knights, it’s more that I took the job personally, for myself. I have reasons as to why I can’t refuse.</p><p>Is Trickstar going to perform on the Festival Eve?&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Yeah. We’ll perform in this event called the Spring Music Festival. We’re teaming up with UNDEAD to form a jazz band, and we’re going to play some instruments there.</p><p>I thought gaining some stamina should be the first step, so I’ve just been thoughtlessly running laps around the sports grounds.</p><p>…Oops. Sorry. Maybe I’m holding you up.</p><p>All that talking refreshed me, so I can help with cleaning up, if you want?</p><p>It must be tough to do it by yourself, Narukami-kun♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Oh my, thank you. You’re such a good boy. I can see why the seniors like you.</p><p>I was always bad at <em>that</em>… hence people tend to think of me like a cheeky, shitty brat who wouldn’t listen to his seniors.&quot;</p><h3 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h3><p><strong>&gt; Rooftop</strong></p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/ijJ1m5y.jpg"></p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Nggh… Yuu-kuuun, how could you be talking so friendlily with Naru-kun!? Why!? And yet, you’re always blatantly avoiding me, your Onii-chan!”</p><p>(Aargh, geez. Soooo irritating. I came to the rooftop for a change of pace, but instead I got to see something I’d rather not! I feel sick.</p><p>While I can just harass Naru-kun tomorrow to vent, how will you pay for this, Yuu-kun?</p><p>Should I cross-examine him by asking ‘<em>You were so friendly with Naru-kun, but why wouldn’t you even talk to me’</em>?</p><p>But that’s just so pathetic, you think my pride will allow that?)</p><p>“Aaaargh geez!

[An unlikely encounter brought by fate]—what a wonderful chance meeting… Hahahaha☆”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Uegh, Mikejima… You’re still hanging around the school? It’s closing time soon, you know?</p><p>Well, not that you were ever the type to follow the rules…</p><p>It’s because you were such a troublemaker that the school didn’t like you and banished you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Hahaha. If it’s about the exchange program, I asked to be picked for the part, you knooow!</p><p>It was quite the wonderful experience, too. Like they say, life isn’t always rainbows and sunshine, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “You sure love your aphorisms… sooooo annoying! What, trying to show off how you’re a man of principles?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Hahaha. What’s wrooong? You seem to be ticked off? OK, OK, come at me! You can vent on me all you like!</p><p>I’ll receive all of it! <em>Hakkeyoi!

I’m feeling down right now so don’t talk to me! Aah, I’m so ticked off! Shoo-shoo!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;You’re as wild as a cat on mating season…</p><p>I came up to the rooftop because I was tired too, so I don’t have the stamina to argue with you. I hope you’ll forgive me, Izumi-san.</p><p>Everything Izumi-san said and did was right, and I was very wrong. Hence, I’ll reflect on it and apologize. It’s my loss.</p><p>And that’s that. The end…♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “You. You’re always so quick to back down, and unconditionally, too… If you’re a boy like me, you’ve got to fight for things sometimes. Damn defeatist.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Hahaha. Maybe it’s just like boys to be bothered by things like victory and defeat. But I think while getting along can be more difficult than arguing, that’s precisely why it’s worth it!</p><p>Don’t you think so, Izumi-saan?&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Urgh, you’re making my head hurt. I don’t know how ‘Leo-kun’ could be friends with someone like you.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Hahaha. Curiously enough, we really hit it off.</p><p>Leo-san always sees the good in people.</p><p>He’ll confidently say ‘I love you!’ to anyone, so to be friends with him, all one has to do is open up, and accept that.</p><p>It’s because that’s what Leo-san is like, that even the twisted Izumi-san could be friends with him, no?&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Hmph… I don’t want you sticking around me any longer than this, so I’ll be going. You should go home soon, too.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “That sounds great, but I’ve got a mountain of work waiting, see. I’m planning to ask the teachers for permission so I can work until late tonight.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Aah… You’re single-handedly producing the Festival Eve, I heard?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Yep. I’m administrating the whole thing, including the school festival itself.</p><p>To be more precise though, I’m acting as an assistant to bridge the Producer—Anzu-san—and the teachers and student council.</p><p>Anyway, I looove festivals and all that racket, after all! So I practically interfered into something that had nothing to do with me, hahahaha☆</p><p>The teachers have left us to ourselves under the claim of treasuring student autonomy…</p><p>While the student council recently experienced a painful loss, which dropped their unifying force. They’re not free to make a move.</p><p>And what’s left is the lone producer, who’s still just a weak girl.</p><p>Someone has to support her from the shadows—and for now, I think that’s my role.</p><p>Because I’m not in any unit, I have the freedom to move; I also have the time to.</p><p>Even back then, Anzu-san was always the type to keep everything to herself. I’m worried.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “…? Mikejima, you knew that ‘amateur’ from before?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Yeah. Though we were kindergarteners back then, and she doesn’t remember me…♪”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Hmm… Well, you’re a perfect superman who can do everything, so I guess things will be fine.</p><p>In the past, you were treated as the go-to for every problem, weren’t you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Hahaha. That’s overestimating me. I just inherited all the tricks Rei-san cultivated, is all.</p><p>Of course I’m trying my best to be an ‘omnipotent helper’ like Rei-san is.</p><p>Anyone will be relieved to know there’s someone to depend on when they’re in trouble.</p><p>Although I couldn’t find a place for me anywhere, at least I want to become… ‘a comfortable place to go’, without turning away anybody.</p><p>Like everyone’s Mama, you know? I know I have a long way to go, though.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Hmn~…. Then how about leaving some of your jobs on us Knights? We’ve been pretty much acting like a helper troupe lately.</p><p>I’m already set to appear on the Fashion Show Naru-kun selfishly accepted, though.</p><p>Kasa-kun is still green, while Kuma-kun is apathetic, so it’s just me and Naru-kun appearing with the two of us.</p><p>I think if it’s just one easy job, those two kids on stand-by can settle it for you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Hahaha! Thanks for the kind offer♪</p><p>Things are going okay for now, but I’ll be sure to depend on you when I need it!</p><p>Let’s help each other in times of needs—then we’ll be a ‘team’ that overwhelms even the strongest ‘individuaal’!</p><p>That’s the normal in Yumenosaki Academy now, right?

Let me hear your objective opinion as a producer!</p><p>Ahaha… Transfer student-chan is innocently clapping her hands and praising how good I am.</p><p>I’m happy to hear that, but I need you to properly tell me where I’m doing wrong.</p><p>Fufu. It seems you’re not too good at that sort of thing, Transfer student-chan.</p><p>Everyone in Trickstar is really kind too, despite words. No matter how crappy my performance was, they’d still look for something to praise.</p><p>But then Oogami-kun would put me down in the most heartbreaking way possible…</p><p>I wish there’s someone who would keep the balance, pointing out my flaws and giving me the correct advice.</p><p>Sakuma-senpai fits the bill, but he’s something of a unifying leader for both of us Trickstar and UNDEAD until the Spring Music Festival.</p><p>He’s everyone’s Sakuma-senpai. I can’t have him dealing with just me.</p><p>Hmm? What is it, Transfer student-chan? <em>I’m sorry</em>, you say?</p><p>Now, why are you saying sorry? It’s a wonderful thing, to be able to put yourself in others’ shoes and be kind. In reality, polishing others’ talent by praising what they do is ideal.</p><p>But see, if I’m endorsed too much, I think I’ll turn into a hopeless guy…♪</p><p>Fufu. Well, anyway. I’ll be going to the Light Music Clubroom to practice for Spring Music Festival. Transfer student-chan, you should drop by to see how we’re doing if you’re free.</p><p>I can safely say everyone will be happy to see you. Of course, that includes me.</p><p>Umm… Because we were doing other things along the way, I can’t really tell, but… we’re done with all of our class duties, right?</p><p>Now we just have to give the class journal to Sagami-sensei.</p><p>Yeah, good work to you too~♪</p><p>Because there was always everyone else, we don’t have much time to talk with just the two of us like this, so I’m happy I could have you for myself today, Transfer student-chan.</p><p>Class duty is a pain, but this one’s lucky~♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Ooi!

Why are you hiding behind me?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Excuse meeeeeee☆</p><p>Ooh? Huuh? Was it my mistakee? I’m pretty sure I heard Anzu-san’s voice coming from over here.

Do you need something from 2-A?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Ooh? If my memory serves, you’re Makoto-san from the Game Research Club, right?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, I dropped out of the Game Club. Stuffs happened, and now I’m a member of the Tennis Club~♪”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Oh-hoh! I see, I see. It’s nice to remain a wanderer, while you’re still young!</p><p>Try your hands on everything until you find something just for you! Hahaha☆</p><p>That aside! Makoto-san, have you seen Anzu-san around by chance? I have something I’d like to ask heer♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Eh? Anzu… Ah, you mean Transfer student-chan.</p><p>(<em>whispers</em>) Umm, hello… He’s calling for you~… Transfer student-chan?</p><p>Whoa, whoa! Don’t hide yourself under my blazer! Are you some kind of small animal, Transfer student-chan!?&quot;</p><p>(S-Somehow it seems like… Transfer student-chan is afraid of Mikejima-senpai? I took her for a spunky girl who wouldn’t falter at the face of most people, though…</p><p>Ahaha. She’s trembling. This side of her might be refreshingly cute, too♪</p><p>No, wait, I shouldn’t be watching in comfort! Umm, let’s see, what to do… What should I do at a time like this?</p><p>For now, I can try talking our way out of this?)</p><p>“E-Excuse me! Mikejima-senpai, what is it do you need from Transfer student-chan?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;<em>Transfer student-chan</em>? So that’s what she’s usually called! To be called by a nickname is proof she’s getting along with everybody!</p><p>Great, great! Since Anzu-san is such a shy kid, I was worried she wasn’t making any friends! Hahaha☆</p><p>That aside! While it doesn’t seem Anzu-san is here, I’ll say this just in case:</p><p>If you don’t show yourself soon, I’ll expose your embarrassing secrets from kindergarten, Anzu-san!☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Oh.

There have been some troubles with the Festival Eve plans, you see…</p><p>I was away for some time, so I’m not too familiar with the school’s current institution.</p><p>Hence, I’d love to borrow some wisdom from Anzu-san, said to be the up-and-coming produceer!</p><p>Let’s go together! Of course, I won’t force you if you have something else to do, though.</p><p>Could it be you were in the middle of going on a date with Makoto-san?</p><p>Well, you guys looked so friendly with each other, hahaha☆ Are you dating him? Introduce your boyfriend to Mama!</p><p>Hmm? <em>You’re not Mama</em>, you say?</p><p>[How unfortunate]! You say some very sad things, Anzu-san.</p><p>I wonder if you’re having your rebellious phase… but that means you’re starting to bloom into a full person, which is something to celebrate! Hahaha☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> (W-What is this, I wonder? I don’t really get what he’s saying, but it seems Mikejima-senpai… has some sort of complicated connection with Transfer student-chan?)</p><h3 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h3><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/LshlnDs.jpg"></p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> (Aah… Another lonely runway for me today.</p><p>It’s nothing new, so I don’t mind… I know I have the sort of twisted personality that gathers hate from people.</p><p>Especially the period from right before I entered high school… I was at the peak of my popularity—but unable to go further, I vented my frustration on my surrounding.</p><p>I didn’t have the calm to care for others; even I realize now that I was being a lame brat.</p><p>But that’s okay. Shallow people who change their opinions at the flick of a switch can’t be trusted; being hated by them doesn’t hurt me.</p><p>If I show results… Once I show them that I’m the top model, I know they’ll change their attitude to me by 180 degree.</p><p>You guys just keep rotating like a wind vane.</p><p>I’m tired of seeing that. I’ve had plenty. Yet I know I can’t stop or turn back when I’ve come this far.</p><p>Life is short. If I shatter halfway, that means the past me who worked so hard for this will never be rewarded.</p><p>So I’ll keep walking down this path. It doesn’t matter that no one follows behind me. You’re just going to be in the way, anyway. All of you.</p><p>Yuu-kun was the only one. At least, until I entered high school.</p><p>Little, clueless, silly Yuu-kun… was the only one who looked at me with eyes that sparkled like jewels.</p><p>He praised me. <em>You’re so amazing</em>, he said.</p><p><em>I want to be like you, Izumi-san.</em> So innocently.</p><p>I was so happy, Yuu-kun.</p><p>But… if you turn into someone like me, you’ll just be repeating the same mistake, Yuu-kun.</p><p>I knew that, but his innocent praises got to my head… as a result of that, I only watched as Yuu-kun sunk into the bloody pond until his neck.</p><p>So I thought I shouldn’t let that happen the second time, but…</p><p>Despite acting like I’m better than him as a senior, I guess in the end I was still a brat.</p><p>He told me he wanted to be like me, so in my happiness, I taught him all sort of things.</p><p>However. With each new thing I taught him, Yuu-kun matured.</p><p>From an innocent child, to a filthy adult covered in mud… I should’ve known that.</p><p>But I was so happy I couldn’t hold back… I couldn’t stop myself. I couldn’t do anything.</p><p>I only watched as Yuu-kun was soiled.</p><p>No—<em>I</em> was the one who soiled him.</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>I want to apologize and make it up all to you… But you wouldn’t even let me near you, Yuu-kun.</p><p>……)</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Umm~…? Sorry, can I have a minute?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Hmm? Huh, is this a dream…?</p><p>Hey, wait! Naru-kun, get rid of the background music! I can’t hear Yuu-kun’s voice like this!

I didn’t mean to interrupt you guys…”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> “Oookaay, so whose orders should I listen to…?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Mine, obviously!</p><p>More importantly… What’s wrong, Yuu-kuuun?</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/YlseuNg.jpg"></p><p>Aaah, are you finally going to be honest with me?</p><p>You’re starting to feel like participating in the Fashion Show with me, right!?

S-Save me, Narukami-kun!”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Wait up, why are you asking Naru-kun to save you? I don’t get it! When your most dependable Onii-chan in the world is right in front of you!</p><p>Tell me, since when were you and Naru-kun friends? I didn’t hear about that!&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Izumi-chaaan. Not like it matters, but can we finish the Fashion Show rehearsal first?</p><p>I’m tired of you making me go through this with you so many times.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Haah? Like I can end things in such a half-hearted state!</p><p>The gym is ours to use for the whole day, okay? We’re gonna stay behind and practice until we’ve got this down perfectly!&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Umm. You two are participating in the Fashion Show for the Festival Eve, right…?</p><p>I heard about it from Mikejima-senpai~ It’s so fitting for you two, huh♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Not <em>two</em>, but <em>three</em>, right? Yuu-kun is going to join the Fashion Show with me, after all…♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “What is this person babbling off about!? His eyes look totally serious—isn’t he completely losing the ability to separate fiction from reality? It’s scary!”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> “Ahaha… Not that it matters, but Yuuki-kun: you needed something from us, right? What is it? You said something about Mama?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Mama? Ah, I guess that’s what you call Mikejima-senpai…</p><p>Umm, so you see. He asked me to do something for him. How should I put this—I’m here to negotiate.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Negotiate? If it’s Yuu-kun asking, I’m willing to give anything unconditionally, though?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Like I said! Why do you keep saying crazy things with the most serious look on you, Izumi-san? Were you always this kind of person?</p><p>Weren’t you usually a bit colder…?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Ahaha. Izumi-chan has been practicing for the Fashion Show nonstop, you know.</p><p>Maaaybe he’s a little out of it. Not enough calm to gather his thoughts, I guess?</p><p>We’re having a harder time than we thought with this Fashion Show…</p><p>I thought it was the perfect job for us, but it turns out we need to deal with everything ourselves, starting from the preparation.</p><p>I know you guys in Trickstar always do things this way, though. I’m surprised by how well you guys are doing, really.&quot;</p><h3 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h3><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/GGysymg.jpg"></p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;That’s how it is. We’re pretty busy, and while Izumi-chan might be saying some dumb things…</p><p>We might be in trouble if you ask for something too difficult from us.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Ah, that’s okay. I think this won’t be much of a burden for you two…</p><p>Umm, to put it simply: it seems the budget for Festival Eve is looking tight.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Aah… I thought that might be case. It’s nothing but a pre-event for the school festival, yet everyone is putting a lot of power into their show.</p><p>Mikejima’s at the head, right? Just how bad is he at accounting?&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;It might be partly Mikejima-senpai, but mostly that the whole business itself is messy. It seems the scale for both the Festival Eve and school festival is particularly large this year.</p><p>Which means the whole academy is fired up for these events, and that’s a happy thing in itself.</p><p>But the budget, arrangement, and preparations simply can’t keep up.</p><p>So, umm. It’s hard for me to say this, but… the outfits you guys are presenting for Fashion Show will be shared properties.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;…What?</p><p>What the heck? Are you stupid? I wear outfits fitted perfectly for me and <em>only</em> for me. I won’t back down on this.</p><p>Shared? That’s the number one word I hate in this world.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;I know you’ll say that. I’m really, seriously sorry, but we can’t proceed if you don’t cooperate, Izumi-san…</p><p>Apparently there’s no other place to cut down the budget on.</p><p>The management staffs are troubled too~ Can’t you please be the adult and cooperate?&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Aaaaaaabsolutely <em>not</em>.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Uuh~… Really? No matter what? Umm… I use the word <em>shared</em>, but I think it’s a little different from what you’re thinking, Izumi-san.</p><p>Umm, I don’t know how to explain this, but…&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “What <em>is</em> it? I’m getting annoyed! Be more clear, can’t you?”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> “All right, Izumi-chan. That’s your cue to take a deep breath… Nothing to gain from flaring up at Yuuki-kun. Let’s listen to what he has to say until the end♪”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Ugya!? I told you not to cling to me, you damned okama!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha… Well, see. There’s that outfit you’re wearing, right, Izumi-san?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Ah, this?</p><p>It looks pretty good, right? It was quite expensive too; I don’t have money left to spend on the special effects and all that jazz, but… ah well, it was a good purchase.</p><p>Heheh. I had my favorite designer, that I’ve paid attention to since my kids’ model days, make it for me♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto</strong>: “Huh… That means I might know him too?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Don’t you? You know, the one who often gave out snacks during breaks…</p><p>It would’ve made me fat, and I hated being fed like a pet, but he’s good at his job, at least.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, as I thought. I was thinking I’ve seen that style before. That person, huh… how nostalgic; he was always so kind to us.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Wasn’t it for his own sake?</p><p>He must’ve thought he could tame us easily since we’re brats. You know, since if we like him enough, he might be requested for another job, right…?&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Why do you have to be so distrustful…</p><p>Though… we ended up talking about something else. I’m sorry.</p><p>So about those outfits—after you wear them for the Fashion Show, Izumi-san…</p><p>We were thinking if you’ll let us fix them up a little, so we could use them for the Spring Music Festival we’ll appear in.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Ah, that’s what you meant by sharing?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Yeah. Our Spring Music Festival also use musical instruments, which already cost a lot…</p><p>And because our appearance didn’t get decided until the last minute, it seems the budget doesn’t quite fit.</p><p>I know that’s because we were too slow on things, so we don’t have the right to complain.</p><p>But paying for costumes is really looking hopeless…</p><p>UNDEAD, who will appear with us, said they’re willing to shoulder the cost for us, but we’d like to avoid that…</p><p>That’ll make us entirely dependent on UNDEAD… We’ve seriously troubled those people to no end, we can’t be adding more to our debts to them.</p><p>So please, Izumi-san. Can you guys let us wear your outfits after you’re done?</p><p>The Fashion Show might become an advertisement for the Spring Music Festival, which is killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>Is it too much to ask…? It’s too convenient for us, huh?&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Yep. Seriously, you Trickstar are always like that…</p><p>Instead of prioritizing what you want to do, try thinking about the trouble you’re causing for people.</p><p>But maybe you guys are fine as you are—like main characters… Fufufu, that’s so fitting for you, Yuu-kun.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Umm, I wonder about that? I’m just a supporting role to the end; maybe an extra…”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “…Okay then. I accept the deal. But I have conditions.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Ehh? Please don’t interfere while I’m talking; you’re always like that, Izumi-san…</p><p>Err wait, really? You’ll allow us to use your outfits?</p><p>Thank God♪ Transfer student-chan did say she’d guarantee Izumi-san would say OK if <em>I</em> went to convince him…</p><p>But I was still worried whether I could properly negotiate!&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;You’ve always been bad at talking, Yuu-kun.</p><p>Still, we’re no longer children… I guess I can’t be kind and give you everything unconditionally. I want to gain something from this too.</p><p>You understand, right? Bargain.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Y-Yeah… I’m a little scared, but try saying what it is.</p><p>I do hope it’s not going to be such a mean condition… but I’ll do anything within my power.</p><p>This is an important time for Trickstar. I can’t come to a deadlock here.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Of course you can’t… Hey, what should I do, Naru-kun? I’m such a lucky man☆</p><p>Yuu-kun just told me he’ll listen to anything! What should I do with him? Fufufu♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;You have the face of a villain, Izumi-chan…</p><p>Don’t act too much like degenerate, please. We’re in a delicate time too, since we’re in the middle of restoring our name.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “I know. It’s my fault Knights is having a hard time now. I feel enough remorse to fill the tip of the nail on my little finger.”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> “No, seriously, be more sorry about it… Sheesh, what a <em>darling</em> of an Onii-chan we have here…”</p><h3 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h3><p><strong>&gt; Hallway 1st Floor</strong></p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/c1PO7oG.jpg"></p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Ooi!

So you’re worried for Makoto-san because he’s been acting weird?</p><p>He would sneak out of Spring Music Festival practices sometimes and go somewhere?</p><p>That’s certainly a cause for curiosity, but Makoto-san is free to do whatever he wants, wherever he wants, right?</p><p>It doesn’t appear like you’re Makoto-san’s lover or family, either, so I think there’s limit to being meddlesome, Anzu-san.</p><p>Well, I know that Makoto-san is the type of child one can’t help but worry about.</p><p>Oh-hoh. So Makoto-san started acting weird after he was sent to negotiate with Izumi-san for the Festival Eve?</p><p>The negotiation was a success, but it looks like there was some kind of condition?</p><p>Since you were the one who forced Makoto-san to be the negotiator…</p><p>You think it’s your responsibility if Izumi-san was doing something bad to him, is that right, Anzu-san?</p><p>I don’t think Izumi-san will do anything bad, thooough…</p><p>But if you’re curious anyway, rather than taking this kind of detour, you should ask the person himself.</p><p>You made Makoto-san and Izumi-san come in contact because you believed it could be a chance to restore their relationship, right?</p><p>You should watch how things are going for now, and just take responsibility for whatever results your action fruited.</p><p>That’s a Producer’s role, isn’t it? It might be a different problem entirely if they asked for your help; but too much meddling is simply out of line.</p><p>Well, that is simply my opinion, and you have the freedom to think differently, Anzu-san.</p><p>Hahaha. So you’ll go ask Makoto-san, since you’re worried, after all?</p><p>You were such a clumsy kid, but now you’re already capable of acting like a guardian♪</p><p>Okaay then! I’ll go with you and deal with trouble if there’s any. I can prove to be pretty useful, y’knoow; you should work me hard as you see convenient… Producer.&quot;</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/cHxreZd.jpg"></p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;We’re here~ Let’s see, how are they doing?</p><p>Soon, it will be about time for the Fashion Show that Izumi-san and Arashi-san will appear in to commence.</p><p>After that, on the special stage set on the campus, the Spring Music Festival will start.</p><p>And there are lots other events of various sizes held around the campus, so the whole school’s gonna be a carnival! How fun! How festive! Hahaha♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “~…♪”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Oh, that’s Makoto-san. He’s looking like always; you might have been worrying over nothing, Anzu-saan…</p><p>He looks relaxed. That’s a good look on him.</p><p>But what is he doing? He’s playing tambourine…?&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Stop right there! Don’t make me repeat this, Yuu-kun!</p><p>More <em>stylishly</em>! You were so focused on hitting the tambourine, you ended up bending down! Straighten up that pathetic back!</p><p>Once more, from the top!</p><p>Today’s the day, so you’ve got to put more spirit into it! It always takes you <em>so</em> long to start up your engine, Yuu-kun! Aargh geez, this is frustrating me!&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Err… Izumi-san, are you done with your own rehearsal? One more hour and it’ll be time for the Fashion Show, you know?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Haah? You think I don’t keep track of my own schedule? Don’t make a fool out of me! Soooo annoying!</p><p>Of course I’m ready. I’ll do it perfectly from start to end… So Yuu-kun, you should only focus on yourself rather than worrying about needless things.</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/WOEAoSq.jpg"></p><p>Were you <em>even</em> in the position to worry about other people to start with? Pitiful Yuu-kun, who can’t do anything!</p><p>Clumsy, pathetic Yuu-kun—whose pretty face is his only saving grace!</p><p><em>My</em> Yuu-kun!</p><p>But, you’ve decided to do your best on many other things, right?</p><p>I don’t like it, but this is how our bargain went anyway. I’ll assist you while you’re still hopeless.</p><p>Be grateful. Feel indebted to me to death. Say thank you, Yuu-kun.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Right, right. Thank you very much~…</p><p>You’re really helping me. Honest.&quot;</p><h3 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h3><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Y9A7IJD.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;But I still don’t get it. Why did you make <em>looking after me</em> the condition of the bargain, Izumi-san?</p><p>I was in a stalemate kind of situation, so I’m saved that you’ll give me advice, but… I’m the only one profiting from this bargain, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. That <em>stalemate</em> is probably a mistaken expression, but I guess what’s important is that it gets through♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “That surprised me!? Huh, it’s you, Mikejima-senpai… and Transfer student-chan! W-What’s up, you two?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Heeey you… Don’t just brazenly step in here, outsiders. Right now, this place is a holy sanctuary just for me and Yuu-kun alone.”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;No, no. I’ve been here the whole time, okay? Soometimes… or more like whenever Yuuki-kun is around, you’ll just conveniently forget my whole existence, don’t you… Izumi-chan?</p><p>Talk about rude. It’s not in my character, but I might be jealous.</p><p>Oh my? Transfer student-chan, did you say I’m beautiful? Thank you~♪</p><p>Ufufu. Since I’m going to appear in the Fashion Show, I’ve changed into these clothes.</p><p>It does irritate me that I end up with the same design as Izumi-chan because of budget, though.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;You can do nothing about that, Naru-kun. Stop complaining already…</p><p>I’m unhappy with a lot of things too. I was forcing myself to accept it by telling myself it’s just a minor performance before the actual school festival.</p><p>Seriously, what’s a Fashion Show when there’s only a single new design? The rest are existing costumes from the warehouse.</p><p>They say fashion trends change within the span of a single second. And now I have to be wearing some outdated clothes that are covered in dust…</p><p>Noooo way. Don’t wanna.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Don’t say that, now. Your favorite designer said he’ll lightly touch up the old costumes to make them look new.</p><p>Let’s just work under those terms.</p><p>He’s willing to do extra work for no pay, after all. You have to be thankful, Izumi-chan.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Hmph, he loves to make people owe him, that designer… Well, we gave him trouble, and I do want to keep doing business with him.</p><p>He makes some really great outfits, after all.</p><p>There’s Kasa-kun who cheekily got worked up saying ‘<em>Why did you not tell me about this!?’</em> and willingly became our errand boy too.</p><p>One way or the other, this Fashion Show will be a success.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Ufufu. He must’ve been lonely to be left out of the loop, that Tsukasa-chan.</p><p>Now I wish we could’ve dragged Ritsu-chan into this too, but he’s been high-strung lately.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Hmph. What’s a guy like Kuma-kun doing acting like he has real worries? He wasn’t supposed to be that sort of character. He’s usually so apathetic it ticked me off.</p><p>Seriously, I wonder if something happened.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Ah, it seems there was something between him and Isara-kun…</p><p>Maybe they couldn’t be straightforward with each other and ended up fighting. It doesn’t feel right when the air around them is tight, so I wish they can make up soon.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Yeah, right? They could take a page from our book!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Err no, it’s not like we made… up? It was always just you persistently bothering me, even back then…”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Haah? But you were the one who called out to me first.</p><p>Stop making everything my fault and acting like the only good kid!&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Right, stop. Don’t start fighting too, you two… that’ll be a pain.</p><p>What’s in the past stays in the past and we’re in the present. The Fashion Show is starting soon. Get into work mode, okay? ♪</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;…I know. I’m a professional; I’ll give the show my all.</p><p>It’s a little late, but the designer who made these outfits will arrive at the scene soon, so we’ll have him make the last check.</p><p>Then all’s left is to do everything perfectly.</p><p>I was doubting how it’ll go at first, but it’s wrapping up pretty nicely. That’s a given though, when it revolves around me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;There you go, even though you’re still a nervous wreck inside. But we can’t relax yet; no one can tell what might happen until the show.</p><p>Well, I’m sure it’s nothing you don’t already know, Izumi-chan.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Obviously. …Yuu-kun, you should reunite with your comrades too. If you keep sticking to me, won’t that cheeky orange-haired brat worry?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Orange-hair… Aah, you mean Akehoshi-kun?</p><p>Fufu. If Akehoshi-kun is wary around you, you deserve it, Izumi-san. It means what you did was really that bad~ I hope you’d reflect on it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Haah? It’s because I <em>am</em> reflecting on it that I helped you with such a cheap bargaining chip, you know? I could’ve made a muuuch nastier demand, do you realize?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Fufu. But I really don’t understand why you made this the condition:</p><p>That I’ll have to do my practice for the Spring Music Festival in front of Izumi-san whenever possible.</p><p>Wasn’t it a bother, to have me playing tambourine so close to you? And you poked at my mistakes like there was no tomorrow, Izumi-san…</p><p>I was bothering you, right? I was in your way, wasn’t I?</p><p>Honestly though, for me, it’s a help that you gave me so many advice.</p><p>I got rid of most of the parts I was troubled with; I think I can proudly say I can give the Spring Music Festival my all.</p><p>But, still… I can’t imagine what was in it for you, Izumi-san.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> “Ahaha. That’s a rather cruel question to make, you know… Yuuki-kun?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;You know, Yuu-kun, why don’t you try using your head a bit? Work your brain so it won’t lose out to your pretty outside appearance, yeah…?</p><p>Well, they do say the gods don’t bestow two gifts to a single person.</p><p>You guys are going to use these outfits we present in the Fashion Show for your Spring Music Festival, right?</p><p>If you guys put up a pathetic performance there, all the trouble we went through to express the outfits’ charm will go to waste.</p><p>You produce miserable results, and that’ll affect us too.</p><p>Basically, don’t drag us down with you.</p><p>I don’t want you guys to turn our hard-earned results upside down… That’s all there is to it. So don’t misunderstand, okay?</p><p>Once the Fashion Show is over, we should be free, so… I’ll be seeing your stage.</p><p>Make sure to stay focused. If your performance is crap, know I’ll be there to throw rocks and empty cans at you guys.</p><p>So, well… do your best, Yuu-kun.</p><p>I might not be able to stand on the same stage as you. But Onii-chan is always watching over you, Yuu-kun.&quot;</p><h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2><p><strong>&gt; Band stage</strong></p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/9zbH9op.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “♪~ ♪~ ♪”</p><p>(All right~! Yes, yes! I’m doing good~♪</p><p>I’m managing to perform with my own charm, without being a burden to anyone!</p><p>Each time I hit the tambourine, the audience respond by moving their bodies!</p><p>They clap their hands to my tambourine’s melody!</p><p>This feeling of unity makes me so happy… Aah, live concerts really are fun.</p><p>Back when I was still in modeling, I couldn’t quite feel ‘united with everyone’ like this.</p><p>All I needed was to show the perfect beauty the cameraman sought from me.</p><p>And in that frame of beauty, I didn’t exist. My true self was buried under the vision everyone desired… fading away until there’s nearly nothing left.</p><p>Leaving only a beautiful shell with nothing inside.</p><p>But now, I know I’m getting slowly fulfilled on the inside too.</p><p>When I play the tambourine, everyone reacts. Spreading a ripple that comes back one-two hundred times stronger.</p><p>I’m filled with warmth. It lets me know—that I’m not just cutting off and selling pieces of myself and letting what’s inside flow out;</p><p>No, we’re bestowing warmth at each other. I can feel it overflowing out of me.</p><p>I love this feeling. I’m glad I became an idol.</p><p>But my talent or skill just can’t match up to everyone else yet…</p><p>They can play the trumpet and contrabass so well even though their time to practice was as short as mine…</p><p>They’re different from me. Sometimes, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the members of Trickstar and acting like one of them fill me with apologetic feelings…</p><p>But for as long as they allow it, I want to stay here. At least, until I could restore everything of me, that I lost as I bled.</p><p>I know I’ve been doing nothing but receiving from you guys.</p><p>But someday, once my inside was filled like how it was originally in the past… I’ll definitely start repaying you little by little.</p><p>This time, instead of having it forcefully dragged out of me—I want to offer it to you guys myself.</p><p>That might be hard to do now, but someday. Surely.</p><p>…Oops, I wasn’t concentrating, was I? I need to be on my guard and do this properly until the end. There’s still the last hurdle I mostly failed during practice.</p><p>Follow the rhythm… and hit the tambourine!</p><p><em>Stylishly!</em> I might still look pathetic, but this is the best I can do now!</p><p>I’ll form a melody and repay what you all have given me!</p><p>…♪)</p><p><strong>&gt; In front of the school gate</strong></p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ooi, Izumi-san! Are you on your way home?”</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/MUfOs9t.jpg"></p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Hmm? Aah, Yuu-kun… Good work today.</p><p>I saw your stage on the Spring Music Festival.</p><p>I snuck out of Fashion Show’s cleanup to watch it, you see… Naru-kun really let me have an earful after that.</p><p>And by the way, Kuma-kun suddenly made an appearance in the Spring Music Festival like it’s normal? What’s up with that? You’ve got to explain it to me later.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Ahaha. I dunno, either. That took me by surprise too~ It’s apparently part of Sakuma-senpai’s plan though.</p><p>Rather than that, I wanted to thank you, Izumi-san.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Haah? I don’t need any thanks… I gave you advice because it was the condition of the bargain, Yuu-kun.</p><p>And whatever another person says can’t fix what you can’t do.</p><p>So, the fact that you were able to perform somewhat well on the Spring Music Festival… was all due to your own effort, Yuu-kun.</p><p>Right, right! I knew you can conquer anything if you try, Yuu-kun…♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. Thank you. Even in the past, you were the only who would say that to me, Izumi-san.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Fufu. Personally, I’d love to have you back as a model, Yuu-kun…</p><p>But you wouldn’t agree to participate on the Fashion Show to the end, so I guess you’re not up to it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Yeah. Not now, at least. It’s still hard for me.</p><p>But someday, once my inside is filled… Someday, maybe I can return to modeling like you want me to, Izumi-san.</p><p>You really took care of me back when I was small, after all.</p><p>I know I need to at least repay that debt. But for now, I have my hands full with just my own problems, so I can’t do that yet.</p><p>But surely, someday. Before you, who’s still cutting off pieces of yourself and selling them, disappear…</p><p>I want to repay everything you’ve given me, Izumi-san.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Don’t rely on a someday. Pay me back now.</p><p>You don’t know what’ll happen in the future. Even if we entwine our little fingers and promise… there’s no telling when even that’ll be treated like <em>something that never happened</em>.</p><p>I’ve had enough of that…</p><p>Hey, Yuu-kun.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eek!? W-Why did you walk up to me like a slippery snake and grabbed my hand? A-Are you planning something strange? M-Mister Policemaaan!”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;What do you take me for…? Yuu-kun, you’re going home now, right?</p><p>Let’s go together. Actually, Naru-kun, <em>that</em> designer… and Kunugi-sensei are going to have a little gathering, see…</p><p>We’ll be reviewing the Fashion Show today.</p><p>Review, we say, but basically, we’re celebrating for the show’s success. Even if you’ll go home earlier anyway, you should show your face for a bit, Yuu-kun.</p><p>As fellow models, there’s a lot we can talk about.</p><p>That designer was really worried about you… Tell him how you feel about your current life so he can relax.</p><p>I’d love to hear your stories too, Yuu-kun.</p><p>Let’s talk a lot. That’ll be enough to repay me—in my eyes, that’s the best reward ever.</p><p>Well, because I was on hiatus for a while too, I had some regrets about my performance in today’s Fashion Show…</p><p>I’m planning to hear out what they have to say and make the best use of it on my next job.</p><p>Though, well… I know Yuu-kun didn’t see my show, anyway.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;No, I snuck out to see it on my breaks, you know?</p><p>It felt like you’d make me stand on stage if I got too close, so I was watching from afar.</p><p>You might be unsatisfied, Izumi-san, but you were perfect as always.</p><p>You’re so amazing… I was impressed. I wonder what I can do to be like you, Izumi-san?&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Ahaha… Then I’ll kindly teach you from beginning to end.</p><p>So let’s go together, Yuu-kun. Let’s walk while holding hands, like when were both small.&quot;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><em>Other notes</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p><hr><section class="footnotes"><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>It’s some kind of yelling usually heard in sumo.

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know if anyone else has translated it, but here’s Madara’s first substory (第一話) that you get from his three-star “Sudden Reunion” (突然の再会) card.</p><p>When someone says Anzu, I get revived from my grave…</p><p><strong>Written by:</strong> Akira<br><strong>Timeline:</strong> Spring</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="mikejima-madara-chapter-one">[Mikejima Madara] Chapter One</h2><p>&gt; Outdoor stage</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Ooi! Over here~! Yahooooo☆</p><p>Ooh, no response?</p><p>When I shout “Yahoo!” I wish you’d return with another “Yahoo!” like echoes from a mountain, but well, I guess you’re a tad too tiny to be a mountain.</p><p>[Here’s for a once in a lifetime encounter]! All that aside, I’m happy to meet you!</p><p>My name is Mikejima Madara, and I’m your partner for today’s part time job!</p><p>Yeah yeah! We’re here to clean and strike the stage! Idols can sing and dance all they want, but someone needs to clean up after them, right?</p><p>This stage set’s prolly going to find more uses in the future, so we need to wipe everything sparkling clean!</p><p>Look, here are the cleanser and the mop… thoough, before that, you’d better change your clothes first.</p><p>Yep, change into something you can get dirty! Liike jersey or a shirt you can use for cleaning work… Have something like that with you?</p><p>I don’t mind lending mine, but it’ll look a little too big on you.</p><p>[Laugh a hearty laugh]! No need to bow your head soo deeply! You haven’t gotten used to things here, and all!</p><p>Be that your efforts end up in failure, I want you to persist on and build up experience, until you grow into a big woman!</p><p>A little bird told me you’re the transfer student, is that right?</p><p>Then nothing you can do! It’s all right! You are just like a newborn, setting your foot in this world for the first timeee!</p><p>Mama’ll spoil you kindly like treasure! Let me lift you up high and high~☆</p><p>…Hmm? Oh my? Could you possibly be Anzu-san?</p><p>Let me take a look at your face.</p><p>And give me a smile, say cheese…☆</p><p>Aah, I knew it! I know that smile! How nostalgi~c! It’s Anzu-san, it’s Anzu-san! You’ve grown so big!</p><p>[An unlikely reunion brought by the quirk of fate]! What a strange twist to happen. I’m happy to meet you again!</p><p>Hahaha! If you can’t remember me, that’s fine. We were both practically in kindergarten back then.</p><p>Didn’t we use to play sometimes at the public park in the neighborhood? Tag and hide-and-seek and stuffs!</p><p>I almost never forget people I’ve met! But still, to think I’d see you again in a place like this!</p><p>There’s nothing happier! This is why life’s so fun☆</p><p>Hmm? That’s right! Remember me now? It’s Mama!</p><p>Hahaha! I would always play the mother when playing house—even as a kid, I really liked taking care of people~♪</p><p>If you shorten the name Mikejima Madara, you’ll get Mama, so everyone’s taken to calling me Mama somehoow!</p><p>Hahaha! Children have such honest, sweet naming sense!</p><p>But—Anzu-san, you were the only one who never called me Mama till the end…♪</p><p>Yeah! No worries, no worries! I <em>do</em> realize I’ve been holding you up high in my excitement! Let me put you down now… Gently…</p><p>…so I fake, when I lift you up instead! ☆</p><p>Hahaha! You’re angry, you’re angry! I’m sorry, really; whenever someone orders me to do something, I have this bad habit of wanting to do the opposite.</p><p>People has this tendency to care too much for surroundings and copy others just because—but I feel that’s a little dangerous…</p><p>Considering everyone’s so different and interesting, that’s such a pity, riiight?</p><p>I get creeps when everyone wears the same look! Makes me want to gift them with masks!</p><p>Anzu-san, do you want a mask? I have some cute ones too, like this Usagi-san here! You can have it for just 300 yen! Come and buy, come and buy!</p><p>To celebrate our reunion today, I’ll give you a discount of 50 yen!</p><p>Hmm? Right, this stand is my personal belonging, yeeah? When there’s festival… or I guess they call it DreamFest these days—I sell stuffs in the premises of Yumenosaki, and on some of the other days too!</p><p>[A thriving business]! If you spot my stand, I hope you’ll drop by and make a purchase! My takoyaki is the stuff!</p><p>Wait here, Anzu-san! Before a day of hard work, let’s have a meal! I’ll present you with festival food!</p><p>With the friendship discount, you can have it for just 300 yen…☆</p><p>Have it while it’s cheap! Come and take a look! We give out extras for each purchase!</p><p>Hmm? <em>‘Rather than that, let’s get to work’,</em> hmm?</p><p>Right, right! Work is important! Well done! You have impressed Mama! You’ve grown so admirably, Anzu-san♪</p><p>However, this is this and that is that! Look at how well these takoyakis turned out! At least have a plate, okay?</p><p>This time I’ll hold back the tears and give you a free service—just go take them, you thief…☆</p><p>Yummy? Yep, thank you! The <em>dashi</em> soup is my secret!</p><p>Hmm? ‘<em>Let’s start the work once we’re done eating’</em>, is it? Noow you’re scolding me. Like this, I can’t tell which of us is the Mama! Talk about thrilling☆</p><p>Oh-hoh? So Anzu-san; because you’re a Producer, instructing idols is also part of the job?</p><p>Spoken like a true adult! Hahaha! True what they said about children’s ability to grow without the parents!</p><p>…Oops! Damn, that’s the student council! I’ll be escaping, so I’m leaving the rest to you!</p><p>To tell you the truth, I have nothing to do with the ‘on-campus part time job’ you’ve taken, Anzu-san!</p><p>While setting up my stand, I saw the stage was dirty and started cleaning on my own, that’s all!</p><p>So I had nooothing to do with anything! Hence the student council will scold me when they see me; I’ll be taking my leave for a bit!</p><p>But if it looks like you need help, I can come back for you later, Anzu-saan!</p><p>And so farewell—reluctant I may be! Let us meet again, Anzu-san! It was a blessing to meet you, but life is full of goodbyes!</p><p>[Parting from one’s beloved is suffering]! But with a smile, your life will be full of roses! That’s why, if you find that you can’t smile, please call for me!</p><p>Mama will always be your ally, Anzu-san! See you, then! Bye-byeee…☆”</p><hr><p><strong>Translator’s note:</strong></p><p>His speech style is killing me and I don’t know how to translate it (laughs).</p><p>[ ] in the original Japanese, he uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yojijukugo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yojijukugo/four-character idioms</a>.</p>]]></content>

I’m sorry, I’m sorry — Azusa’s awful at tennis!</p><p>A–Are you injured?</p><p>Hwe? Ah, the tennis ball didn’t hurt, but you fell from the surprise? That’s horrible! Azusa will get the emergency kit, so let her take a look!☆</p><p>No need to hold back, please. Azusa is the one at fault, after all… Okay, please stay still. I’ll put a little disinfectant☆</p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Y4gNZqM.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Petapeta, kyukkyu~♪ Sharanra~n</em><em>☆</em></a></p><p>And this should do it~</p><p>Ehehe. Azusa often falls down too, so she always makes sure to have an emergency kit around☆</p><p>That was awfully careless of me… Does it still hurt?</p><p>Ah, pardon the late introduction. Kobato Azusa, is my name. I’m from 1-C, and I’ve been trying my best in the Tennis Club since this spring~☆</p><p>Azusa has only started playing tennis, so she’s still horrible at it… She’s only been dragging everyone down; She can’t even fetch the balls well.</p><p>It <em>is</em> fun, though. Perhaps it’s silly to expect to be good at everything so fast☆</p><p>…Huh?</p><p>Pardon, have we met somewhere before?</p><p>Ah, no… Sorry. That was a weird thing to say. Hmm…?</p><p>Oh, is that so? So you are the rumored transfer student senpai, yes?☆</p><p>Azusa heard a rumor about a boy transferring into Tsuyuri-senpai’s class. Azusa is from the Health Committee, like Tsuyuri-senpai~☆</p><p>So if you find yourself with an injury again, please feel free to see us in the Nurse Office. Azusa will take a look at you with a sparkling smile☆</p><p>Oh, you fetched the ball for me? Thank you very much! You’re so dependable, senpai.</p><p>…As I thought, you really resemble <em>someone</em>. Hmm…?</p><p>Ah, the Captain is calling for me… Azusa would love to speak with you more, senpai, but…</p><p>Azusa will go back to practice for now.</p><p>Azusa needs to practice tennis more and improve, so she won’t be a burden to the club!☆</p><p>Hwe? <em>Do your best</em>…? Are you cheering for Azusa?

There’s no one by the gate—maybe they’ve gone home, already?</p><p>That’s one lucky thing, Onii-chan-senpai! This way, we don’t have to be scolded by the Disciplinary Committee Head!</p><p>Oh, sheesh. Feeling happy over something like this, that’s quite naughty of Azusa, huh?</p><p>Ehehe. Despite how she may look, Azusa was quite the delinquent back in the days, you know☆</p><p>Ah, but she didn’t hurt anyone, okay? If Azusa did anything like that and word got out, she won’t be able to go on as a Health Committee member!☆</p><p>Onii-chan, could it be you haven’t heard stories of Azusa’s past?</p><p>Aah, it’s nothing. It’s good if you haven’t. Azusa thought that you might’ve heard something from Anzu-san.</p><p>…Ah, no, no! It’s nothing you should worry about☆</p><p>But still, things were hectic today with the sport clubs girls everywhere jamming their fingers under balls and hurting their knees, huh?☆</p><p>Because the other Health Committee members weren’t around today, Azusa had her hands full taking care of everything—but it was good that you were there to help, Onii-chan!☆</p><p>You’re always helping other people somewhere out there, Onii-chan. That’s so wonderful of you. Let Azusa praise your efforts with a sparkling smile☆</p><p>Or maybe, you’d prefer to receive something as thanks?</p><p>Ah. Come to think of it, we’re near the shoe lockers right now, aren’t we? It reminds Azusa a little of the past☆</p><p>Fufufu, I think you’ll be surprised to find out!☆ About ‘The Love Letter Great Strategy’!</p><p>That’s a good look of surprise, Onii-chan☆</p><p>…Err, don’t tell me, are you turned off?</p><p>Geez, that’s not nice! You’re Azusa’s Onii-chan, after all—</p><p>You need to properly accept anything Azusa said! Or else, Azusa will sulk on you, okay?</p><p>Right, right; that’s the way! <em>What’s the Love Letter Great Strategy</em>, you ask? If you’ll show me an interest like that, it’ll make it more fun for Azusa to tell you, too!☆</p><p>Actually, there was this time when Azusa stuck around the school at night and snuck love letters to people’s shoe lockers☆</p><p>At that time, Kimisaki Academy was of course still an all-girls school, so it turned into an uproar over the culprits who put those love letters into the lockers…</p><p>But there were girls who conveniently misunderstood that their crush was the one who put the love letter; they confessed and even became couples☆</p><p>Hwe? Is it strange that they ended up couples, even though it’s an all-girls school?</p><p>It must be because love is above sex and gender… ☆</p><p>So anyway, Onii-chan… how about Azusa give you a letter of thanks to express her gratitude to you?</p><p>I’ll aim to write a letter that can put a sparkling smile on your face, Onii-chan; because you’re always worried for Azusa’s sake☆</p><p>Eh, that’s not something I should boldly report to you before giving…? Is that how it is?</p><p>If that’s the case, then maybe Azusa should really send a love letter instead as a surprise☆</p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Dvx79to.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="Intimacy Azusa" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Dvx79to.jpg"></a></p><p>Hwe…? Ah! I said love letter, but I don’t mean it’s a confession of my romantic love, okay? I mean the general philanthropic kind of love?☆</p><p>Azusa will send you as deep a love as what she showed to everyone in the Tennis Club and Health Committee…☆</p><p>But yes; perhaps, if it’s Azusa and you, Onii-chan, a different type of love could bloom… Fufufu☆”</p><hr><h2 id="intimacy-kobato-azusa-chapter-3">[Intimacy] Kobato Azusa, Chapter 3</h2><p><strong>Written by:</strong> Akira</p><p><strong>&gt; Infirmary</strong></p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/WhNFKcb.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="Intimacy Azusa" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/WhNFKcb.jpg"></a></p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “<em>Sharanra<sub>n</sub></em> ♪</p><p>Let’s make everything neat~♪ Wipe everything sparkling clean with a sparkling smile~♪</p><p>Oh?

Pardon me, let Azusa offer you her apologies with a sparkling smile☆</p><p>Let that one slide, please… You must find me over-familiar, yes? People often say that to Azusa: that she intrudes into others’ space too easily. There must be people who don’t like that, right?</p><p>Eh, you don’t find it unpleasant? Then, may Azusa call you ‘Onii-chan’?</p><p>Uwaah, I love you so much, Onii-chan…☆</p><p>Ehehe. I just sort of hugged you in my joy. You’re so waaarm, Onii-chan…☆</p><p>I’m sorry for this.

We in the Health Committee make sure to be ready for the off-chance that one of those girls get hurt☆</p><p>Pardon? Ah, no no. It’s not a rule, you see.</p><p>So just because you often help us in the Health Committee out, Onii-chan, there’s no need for you to rearrange your schedule and get added to our shift☆</p><p>Just your desire to help makes us happy. We already troubled you so much during weekdays, after all. It doesn’t feel right to force you to help us even on weekends, you see~?</p><p>At first, it was just Maria-senpai attending(?) the place on her initiative during weekends. And seeing that, Azusa just wanted to help her too, you know?</p><p>It’s unbearable to simply watch as Maria-senpai, <em>alone</em>, go out of her way to school every weekend, after all.</p><p>Azusa has tennis practice on some weekends, so… you could say she’s filling in for the work here as a side trip~☆</p><p>First Azusa puts up a paper saying ‘If you have business in the Nurse Office, please contact this number’ on the door, then attends her tennis practice. If someone makes a call, she’ll dash all the way here to take care of the problem☆</p><p>Eh? <em>That’s admirable</em>, you say?</p><p>Maria-senpai is the admirable one for taking the initiative to do this! So please, praise her instead! Ruffle her hair for her hard work☆</p><p>Wawaa, hya!? No, not Azusa, but Maria-senpai! Please pat her head instead! Hauu, now Azusa’s hair is all messed up…</p><p>It’s fine, though, since Azusa is in the middle of cleaning; she can’t worry about how her hair looks. But Azusa wishes she could stay the prettiest version of herself in front of you, Onii-chan.</p><p>Ah, yes. There was no injured person to take care of today, and the tennis club’s practice is over. So Azusa is cleaning the office.</p><p>Yesterday… Saturday was Kurumi-chan’s turn to be on stand-by… She’s a little clumsy, that girl. She kind of broke stuffs all over and left the place dirty~☆</p><p>She’s always that way. So if the day before was Kurumi-chan’s shift, Azusa makes sure to clean up the place like this. Azusa loves to clean and turn the place all sparkling~☆</p><p>Uwaah, you’ll help me, Onii-chan? Thank you so much☆</p><p>Err, but, weren’t you here because you had something to do, Onii-chan? Did you hurt yourself somewhere? This is a bit too late to ask though, perhaps…</p><p>Azusa will take a look! Please sit over there—let’s play doctor☆</p><p>Ehehe. Take off your clothes, please; Azusa will diagnose you with a stethoscope☆</p><p>Hya!? I-It was a joke! Why are you so ready to take off your clothes, Onii-chan!? Please have more shame! Azusa doesn’t know where to look!☆</p><p><em>(heart thumping)</em> …Umm, so it doesn’t seem like you’re injured anywhere.</p><p>Uh-huh, so you felt a little dizzy, and thought it better to take a rest in the Nurse Office just in case?</p><p>It must be from exhaustion. I think. You’re always busily running all over, Onii-chan.</p><p>Uh-huh… So you were helping out with Basketball Club’s preparation today, since they had a practice match?</p><p>Oh, Onii-chan. You work too much. Let Azusa spoil you for the good boy you’ve been~☆</p><p>Mm-hmm, you skipped breakfast today because you woke up too early? And your lunch got eaten by Komatsu-senpai from the Basketball Club?</p><p>You have to take your meals properly, or you’ll find yourself passing out from anemia. Since you worked so hard today on an empty stomach, it’s no wonder you felt dizzy from exhaustion.</p><p>Sheesh, Onii-chan… You always put others before yourself… exactly like Anzu-senpai. Do you know that doesn’t make anyone happy? Please take care of yourself better.</p><p>…I’m sorry, that must’ve been uncalled for. Azusa made a lunch box for herself today, so please eat that instead. Azusa will buy a bread to eat from the school canteen.</p><p>They should still be open, even if it’s weekend… Geez, no need to hold back! Open your mouth, aaan~</p><p>Ehehe, does it taste good?</p><p>That’s great… Azusa is actually quite clumsy, so she’s awful at cooking. But since Kurumi-chan always cooks with such a happy look on her, Azusa’s studying from her right now~☆</p><p>Aah… umm, it’s okay. Kurumi-chan is actually really knowledgeable about cooking, see. We properly made edible food, okay?</p><p>Fufu. So you ate everything clean. I’m pleased to see you enjoyed it~☆</p><p>Then Azusa will go prepare the bed. Please lie down and get a little shut-eye, okay? I’ll get everything ready in a minute~☆</p><p>Nhi? No, no. That thing about sleeping after eating makes you fat—that’s actually just a hoax… It’s good for digestion. What you just ate will surely turn into nutrition for the body faster~☆</p><p>Now have a rest, and return to your usual energetic self, Onii-chan☆</p><p>Here, it’s ready. I’ve prepared the bed, so you can sleep here.☆</p><p>Eh? No, I won’t sleep together with you, Onii-chan… You can be uncharacteristically spoiled sometimes, can you…?</p><p>But Azusa will stay by your side until you’re deep into slumber… So please relax, and take all the rest you want, Onii-chan☆</p><p>Good boy, good boy…</p><p>Ehehe. Azusa was lonely by herself, as well, so it was fortune that you came over, Onii-chan. Have a nice rest, and sweet dreams~…☆”</p>]]></content>

If we rile up the teachers or the student council again, our club might get dissolved this time.</p><p>Aah, this is frustrating.</p><p>Releasing some dull announcements regarding school events? That’s not our job.</p><p>This kind of business communication… Well-behaved puff papers? Leave them to the Broadcasting Club instead, can’t you?</p><p>Aargh, what a pain!</p><p>We in the Newspaper Club are made for more… <em>passionate</em> stuffs!</p><p>We release boiling hot news that should pierce through the readers’ hearts and gouge on old wounds!</p><p>That’s our mission in the Newspaper Club!</p><p>But it’s been really peaceful lately, I guess. Nothing bombastic or sensational to write about, even if we want to.</p><p>Can’t some great case occur somewhere? I know it’s inappropriate for a journalist to go wishing for incidents just to write articles, but still.</p><p>I wish that transfer student could’ve caused more chaos. I had hopes for him.</p><p>I mean, it’s an unreal situation where a lone guy’s been thrown into a space full of girls.</p><p>And yet he acts all cool, not causing any stir… Talk about disappointment, that transfer student!</p><p>The other girls are all weird, too. How can you accept him so easily?</p><p>Soooo boring. Isn’t there some great scoop lying around somewhere?)</p><p><strong>Kasumi</strong>: “…”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “…!?”</p><p>(…Eh? What’s that? I was wondering why there are so many birds and animals flocking there, and…!</p><p>Eeh, what’s up with that? I smell a scoop!</p><p>There’s a girl being swarmed by birds and dogs and cats! It’s getting like one of those sky burials!?</p><p>Who’s she again… I feel like I’ve seen her somewhere? Hmm?</p><p>Wait, is this the time to space out!? That girl, she’s alive, right? She’s not dead, right?</p><p>If she’s dead, that makes a case! A huge scoop!</p><p>Even if she’s alive, well, just having so many animals flock on her is already a bizarre phenomenon on its own!</p><p>We can still write about her! Hiyono seems to be into that sort of occult stuffs, anyway!</p><p>Even if I don’t! But beggars can’t be choosers! I need to take a picture first… Where’s my camera?)</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Midori-kun.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eeek!?</p><p>Y-Y-Y-You! Mineyama, don’t suddenly call out to me from my back!</p><p>You have absolutely no presence! Are you a ghost!?”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Who might you be calling a ghost? Apologies for surprising you.</p><p>But still, I’d appreciate if you don’t stand around there. You’re blocking the sunlight, and I can’t read my book.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Aah… It’s getting dark already, so you’ll just hurt your eyes reading outside.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Oh my, I didn’t notice. The sun is setting, I see. I got a little too immersed…</p><p>Midori-kun, what could you be doing in the courtyard?</p><p>Me, I arrived at this place in my sought for a quiet reading environment.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Aah, I was distributing the latest papers. You too, take one if you’d like…</p><p>Wait, this isn’t the time to be chatting! Look at that over there! <em>That</em>!”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “My, this is a rare sight. It must’ve been a while since I last saw her face.</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “What, you know her?”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “I know most things there are about Kimisaki Academy. I’ve had a little entanglement with her…</p><p>Her name is Mikage Kasumi. She’s the President of the Cooking Research Club.</p><p>Perhaps you’ll get an idea if I say she’s ‘The Fiend of the Cooking Club’?</p><p>She’s an interesting woman, who once belonged to the student council and trifled with the Troublemakers.</p><p>She seems to have completely retired her post though, and now people call her ‘The Hermit of the Cooking Club’.</p><p>I advise you not to get involved with her, Midori-kun. She ‘has no interest in human beings’, and in that sense, she’s dangerous.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “…?”</p><p><a href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/f3098ed91faa2190cb55f95c420fd014/tumblr_inline_oepyjk48on1rr3xef_540.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="image" data-src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/f3098ed91faa2190cb55f95c420fd014/tumblr_inline_oepyjk48on1rr3xef_540.jpg"></a></p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> (…Oh my.</p><p>Oh my, oh my.</p><p>It’s afterschool already~…</p><p>It seems I spaced out again. Oh my~ they’re eating my lunch again.</p><p>My lunch always seems to get eaten by the gathering birds and such, before I can even lay my chopsticks on it.</p><p>I’ve gotten hungry… Oh my, what could this be?</p><p>An article from the Newspaper Club? Hmm, a Cooking Contest?</p><p>I think quite a few young girls have joined the Cooking Club,</p><p>So perhaps I can randomly pick some of them to send to participate in this contest~…?</p><p>It’ll be a good chance to see what the new girls are capable of.</p><p>Perhaps they’ll even create cooking beyond their capabilities, by being pitted against competitors~</p><p>And it seems I can eat all sorts of dishes with this~ Right, right. I’m right, aren’t I? Let’s do that.</p><p>Well, considering they’ll be competing in the name of the Cooking Club…</p><p>If they were to present a horrible dish, I’ll mangle them and boil them in a pot and feed them to the pigs~</p><p>Kukuku! <em>Cooking</em>~!)</p><h2 id="shocking">Shocking</h2><h3 id="shocking-part-1"><strong>Shocking, part 1</strong></h3><p><strong>Location: Classroom</strong></p><p><a href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/7ddcc062005ed0d2d1126e840959cc99/tumblr_inline_oepyuspXsu1rr3xef_540.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="image" data-src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/7ddcc062005ed0d2d1126e840959cc99/tumblr_inline_oepyuspXsu1rr3xef_540.jpg"></a></p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Excuse me!</p><p>Midori Fumi! Are you there, Midori Fumi!? Surrender yourself and come with me meekly!”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Yun, yun.</p><p>Don’t shout, please…”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Whoa, you surprised me! I have no business with you, Electrowave Girl! Bring Midori Fumi to me!</p><p>I absolutely will not forgive her this time! I won’t suspend her punishment any longer!”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “What’s up, Himari-chan? Do you need something from 3-C, maaaybe?</p><p>Ah, are you lost?</p><p>That happens to me too! I blank out and mistakenly go to the second year classrooms sometimes.”</p><p><strong>Mashiro:</strong> “Lost, are you! You poor girl! But fear not, Student Council President! Cheer up!</p><p>You may cry into my chest! ‘Cheer up,’ that is the motto that makes the world go ‘round!”</p><p><strong>Hibiki:</strong> “Ooph! Hey, you two, don’t talk while you’re eating.</p><p>You’re spilling your food on me! I’m wearing a swimsuit so I can just wash it away, but still.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Hibiki-chan, can I ask why you’re wearing a swimsuit, maaybe?</p><p>Gosh, you’re being meaninglessly sexy you’re making my heart race!”</p><p><strong>Hibiki:</strong> “Well… There’s this energetic first year who joined our Swim Club recently…</p><p>It’s troubling how she always comes challenging me into a match during lunch breaks.</p><p>Anyway, I managed to beat her up in the match, but there’s no time to change back to my uniform.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Quiet down, you Weirdo Class! Listen to me! Bring Midori Fumi to me!”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “If it’s Midori-kun you’re looking for, she escaped from the window the moment she heard your footsteps approaching.</p><p>Fufufu, she’s always been good at one thing and that’s being quick on her feet to escape, even in the past…</p><p>Rather than that, can someone wake Kannazuki-kun up for me?</p><p>She’s sleeping on the book I’ve been reading. I’m really curious about the continuation of the story.”</p><p><strong>Hotori:</strong> “Zzz… Zzz…”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Actually, are you Library Committee Duo not going to eat lunch, maaybe? The break will be over before you know it!”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Aah, now that you’ve mentioned it. When I get too focused in reading, I tend to forget my hunger.</p><p>Wake up, Kannazuki-kun. You should take your meals too, once in a while, or you’ll get out of shape.”</p><p><strong>Hotori:</strong> “Hnngaah, my need for sleep is stronger than my need for food~…”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Umm. No one seems to be up for listening to you, so I’ll represent the rest and ask: what’s wrong?</p><p>I can listen to you, if you’re fine with me, student council president.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Urgh. You’re the only sane one in 3-C, Jime-jime. But can you call me Hii-chan instead of Student Council President?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ah, right. I’m sorry, I’m not used to nicknames.</p><p>Fufu. You’re Hii-chan and I’m Jime-jime~…”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Himari-chan, want a pudding?</p><p>Hibiki-chan gave me a large quantity of pudding the other day, and I’ve gotten a little addicted since then!”</p><p><strong>Hibiki:</strong> “Aah, back during the Club Destroyer mess…</p><p>Feed me a spoonful too, I’m tired from all the swimming.”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Sure thing! Okay, open your mouth~”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Yakumo-san, is that homemade? How admirable. You can make sweets, huh?”</p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Yeah, Mitsuru-chan said she loves making sweets, so I thought I’ll try having the same hobby, maaybe…</p><p>And I’ve been working hard on that! A show of my maiden heart, if you will!”</p><p><strong>Mashiro:</strong> “Kodama-san, you make your lunches on your own too, don’t you?</p><p>That’s admirable of you! You’re so feminine, all of you. Unlike me, who can’t even cook or clean or do laundry!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “It’s because I have to make it every day, so I just learned the how-to somewhere along the way.</p><p>I make my little sister’s share too, but it’s getting a little bit of a bad rating from her for ‘tasting dry, like health food’~…”</p><p><strong>Mashiro:</strong> “But health is important! Can I have a bite?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Yes, of course. H-H-Hii-chan, have a bite too.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Thank you… But uh, in the end even you won’t listen to me.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “There, there. I’m sorry, come over here, I’ll listen~…</p><p>Ehehe, Hii-chan~ Did you need something from Midori-san?”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Yeah, there’s something I need to ask, regarding the latest paper that should have announced the Cooking Contest.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Cooking Contest…?”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Yep, a school event that’ll be held in the near future.</p><p>Usually, the school takes care of it, but this year, we in the student council are managing it.</p><p>It’s supposed to be a peaceful event, in which everyone cooks good food and eats together, but…</p><p>Thanks to some mistake or whatever, it’s gotten a little tangled…</p><p>That accursed Midori Fumi! I’ve let my guard down because she’s been quiet lately!”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Aah, I understand now. I read that paper.</p><p>What you want to protest, is the part about the Cooking Contest money prize, right?”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Yeah. The Cooking Contest rewards money to the victor, but it’s just a humble school event to the end…</p><p>The prize is supposed to be a gift certificate worth a thousand yen, just something of that sort.</p><p>And yet, on the paper distributed yesterday…</p><p>They’ve listed the ridiculous sum of <em>ten million yen</em> as the prize money!”</p><hr><h3 id="shocking-part-2"><strong>Shocking, part 2</strong></h3><p><a href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/1f6c299719c994b8d8f1f80fca18adb9/tumblr_inline_oepywaZBxB1rr3xef_540.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="image" data-src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/1f6c299719c994b8d8f1f80fca18adb9/tumblr_inline_oepywaZBxB1rr3xef_540.jpg"></a></p><p><strong>Mashiro:</strong> “The reward for the victor of the Cooking Contest is… ten million yen!?</p><p>Eeh, that’s too many zeros for me to comprehend!</p><p>How much is ten million yen in Japanese yen!?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “I think it’ll still be ten million yen, Hitaki-san.</p><p>Anyway. While Enjouji-san may be capable, preparing such large sum of money is impossible for you, right, Hii-chan?”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Yes. I, the student co~ncil prez, am just one of the common people. At worst case, I can borrow it from Reika…</p><p>But I’m still a high school girl! I don’t want to be in such huge debt! That’s why I’m in trouble, what should I do!?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Aww, poor you… There, there. Good girl.</p><p>Please don’t cry, Hii-chan. I’ll always be on your side~…”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Jime-jime~…”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Excuse me for the interruption, but I think it’s still an abnormal sum.</p><p>So I don’t believe anyone took the article for granted. Normally, they’ll be able to tell it’s a misprint, or a typo, won’t they?</p><p>And it’s coming from that Midori-kun, of the Newspaper Club. They have low reliability rates; though things might be different if this had been during my era.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Your era…? Well, I suppose you’re right.</p><p>The students’ trust level for the Newspaper Club is pretty much zero, for all the shams they wrote during the Student Council President Reelection.</p><p>And they’ve been producing bland articles lately.</p><p>I <em>do</em> review them for censorship first, but I haven’t been able to read to the smallest details in my tight schedule!</p><p>I don’t like reading!”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Weren’t you supposed to be part of the Literature Club, Tsurumi-kun?”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Yes, well… Anyway, that Midori Fumi’s up to no good again, isn’t she?</p><p>I was thinking to interrogate her, but she ran away!</p><p>Running away from me means she must’ve something bad to hide!</p><p>It’s all Midori Fumi’s fault! She’s the one behind the curtains! It’s always like that!”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Hmm… As a friend of Midori-kun, I’d like to say in her defense: she may be prone to be misunderstood, but she’s not a villain at her roots.</p><p>I think she’s exceedingly sorry for what she’s done during the Student Council President Reelection.</p><p>I don’t believe she’ll repeat the same foolish mistake twice.</p><p>But still, Cooking Contest, huh? I admit I’m curious of that Fiend’s movements I’ve been catching.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Fiend? Ugh, anyway!</p><p>I can’t exactly proclaim that the article was a fake this late!</p><p>Midori Fumi already spread the papers so needlessly efficiently throughout the whole school!</p><p>It will be soon known to everyone that the prize money for the Cooking Contest is tremendous!</p><p>It’s going to be a hot topic throughout the school!</p><p>I <em>am</em> grateful to have everyone excited for the event, so I don’t want to pour water on their fun.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “I can see. With that Student Council President Reelection settled,</p><p>You’re just finally starting to perform genuinely as the Student Council President, Hii-chan.</p><p>I’m sure you won’t want to stumble on the first step.</p><p>But, hmm… The student council had been under Enjouji-san’s reign for so long…</p><p>If it’s Enjouji-san, she most definitely can give out ten million yen pretty easily.</p><p>Won’t the people who had gotten used to Enjouji-san’s era end up believing in it?</p><p>Even if a high school student were to get their hands on that much money, I don’t believe they’ll have anything to use it for, though.”</p><hr><h3 id="shocking-part-3"><strong>Shocking, part 3</strong></h3><p><a href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/15c86cadb2fd44779a8134ccf50946a8/tumblr_inline_oepyz0wwqF1rr3xef_540.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="image" data-src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/15c86cadb2fd44779a8134ccf50946a8/tumblr_inline_oepyz0wwqF1rr3xef_540.jpg"></a></p><p><strong>Chizuru:</strong> “Hey, you heard that? They said the prize money for the Cooking Contest is ten million yen!</p><p>All the hard work that’s gone into learning how to cook will be rewarded! I’ll form my dream harem!</p><p>No, no. Maaybe I should gift it to the hospitalized Seira-chan, to cover her hospital expenses?</p><p>We’ve gotten placed in the same class, after all! I want her to enjoy youth together with us~”</p><p><strong>Hotori:</strong> “Hmm. It’s a slightly lacking sum to use to spend the rest of my life playing around.</p><p>But I think it’ll still turn my life into easy mode~”</p><p><strong>Hibiki:</strong> “Ten million yen… I can pay my way to a good school… No, no! I can’t!</p><p>My goal isn’t to <em>enter</em> the university! I’ll win through my own power!”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Spacewalking requires the cost of five hundred thousand yen per thirty minutes.</p><p>If I have ten million yen, I can… Yun, yun~”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Aah…</p><p>They’re all falling for it, or more like, they’re getting dreamy from the possibility of winning a lottery.</p><p>It’s just the right sum to sound realistic, huh? Ten million yen.</p><p>Maybe to say they’ve been blinded by money is a rude way of putting it, but the Cooking Contest is indeed heating up.</p><p>The problem is that the student council doesn’t have the capability to reward such money.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Yeah… I don’t know about Reika’s reign, but the present student council doesn’t have such money!</p><p>Money, as in the student council budget, should be used for better things too!</p><p>That’s why, <em>please</em>! Someone, participate in the Cooking Contest and win!</p><p>I can’t give you ten million yen, but I’ll listen to anything you say!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Aah… There’ll be no problems if someone who understands the circumstances wins, huh.</p><p>The clueless students can keep on dreaming and enjoy the event. The student council won’t have to suffer loss.</p><p>The Cooking Contest will end with everybody smiling.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Yes, that’s what I meant!</p><p>It may be quicker for me to participate myself, but the student council members are all relayed to examiner role!</p><p>This, too, was written in the paper!</p><p>Myself aside, Mitchy and Yukky are both good cooks!</p><p>I could’ve had them participate, but you heard the reason I couldn’t!</p><p>That’s why.

They must’ve been baited by the money prize of ten million yen…</p><p>If only they can participate in the normal school events as actively…)</p><p>“That being said! I am the student co~ncil prez, and the examiner of this Cooking Contest!</p><p>I am! Tsurumi! Himari-chaan~!</p><p>I’ve emptied my stomach for today, so I hope you’ll feed me your delicious cooking!</p><p>I’ll eat until my stomach is full!”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> (Goodness, she’s needlessly energetic as always, the President.</p><p>In the end, she couldn’t find the culprit that turned the prize money into such ridiculous number…</p><p>It was my failing, leaving the investigation to the President because my hands were full from the contest’s preparations.</p><p>But well, at least she seemed to have come up with a second best plan… I think she’s grown a little, the President.</p><p>With all these troubles surging like waves, there’s no time to feel bored…)</p><p>“Anyway! Ahem! I am the student council treasurer, Yuuki Tomoko. I’m also an examiner.</p><p>Other than myself there is the vice president, Yomo Mitsuru-senpai; the extra, Transfer student-san…</p><p>And lastly the Cooking Research Club president, Mikage Kasumi. That makes five examiners in this contest.</p><p>The five of us will grade each team’s dish, and can give the maximum score of twenty each.</p><p>Put together, you can get a maximum score of one hundred.</p><p>Unlike the President, I won’t be merciful, so please take your cooking seriously.</p><p>We expect to be able to taste a dish that will be worth the highest score of one hundred.”</p><p><strong>Mitsuru:</strong> “Tomoko, don’t take out your sword. No need to be so stiff, let’s just have fun.</p><p>Let’s all be calm and self-possessed, so everything will proceed safely.”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “Right… By the way, Vice President. I don’t believe I’ve seen the president of the Cooking Club.</p><p>You did ask her to be an examiner, didn’t you?”</p><p><strong>Mitsuru:</strong> “Ah… Well, Kasumi always takes things slowly…</p><p>She should show herself somewhere along the way, probably.</p><p>She doesn’t have a smartphone, so it’s hard to contact her.</p><p>Depending on the circumstances, we might have to search for her ourselves later.</p><p>She’s probably spacing out somewhere, at worst case.”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “I am not familiar with the Cooking Club president.</p><p>What sort of personage is she? Is she another of those weirdo-oddball sorts?</p><p>Goodness, we wouldn’t have to include such an uncertain factor if the Futaba-senpais would just show up as examiners.</p><p>It seems they’ve been blinded by money? They seem to be planning to participate.</p><p>They’re a shame to the student council… No, I do <em>not</em> even approve of them as student council members.”</p><p><strong>Mitsuru:</strong> “Ahaha. Well, let’s settle it with just us, like always. Support our unreliable President for the sake of our ideals, yeah?</p><p>That’s our mission, isn’t it, Tomoko?”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “You appear strangely excited, Vice President. Are you fond of food?”</p><p><strong>Mitsuru:</strong> “Yep, I love making and eating food!</p><p>If only we don’t have to worry ourselves over that ten million yen prize money thing, I can enjoy the event a lot more, though.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Yes. I don’t know this’ll end, but…</p><p>If Jime-jime, whose cooperation we have asked for, would win, it’ll end A-OK!</p><p>If she doesn’t, we’ll come up with something on the spot! It’s okay! It’ll work out somehow!”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “That’s so reckless…</p><p>Well, fine, though. When things come to worst, we can just have you prostrate and apologize, President.</p><p>If that’s not enough, we’ll just have you form seppuku.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “I don’t wanna die, so I’ll pass on the seppuku…</p><p>Geboku-kun, come over here! There are seats for the examiners, so can you sit here and standby until tasting time?</p><p>If you have other stuffs to do, you can roam the place freely… Just make sure not to get in the way of the girls cooking.</p><p>You’re banned from helping out a particular team too. It’ll be unfair.”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Ah, they’re calling for you, Onii-chan-senpai.</p><p>Hmm… Thanks to Onii-chan-senpai’s help, I managed to finish preparing the wares somehow.</p><p>But I’m still worried. I didn’t think I’d have to represent the Cooking Club in the Cooking Contest.</p><p>I didn’t have any idea about it, so I didn’t prepare any recipe, either.</p><p>The rewritten document did get accepted without problems, but… my partner is someone I’ve just met.</p><p>But it seems she’s in the Cooking Club, so it should be fine, right?</p><p>Umm, you’re Ougi… Koharu-san?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Gau?”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Sorry for making you my partner. I had no one else left to ask.</p><p>This is the first I’ve ever seen you… But as fellow Cooking Club members, let’s get along.”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Gau, gauu~?”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “What’s wrong, why are you looking around restlessly? What a hyperactive girl…”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Her Highness (<em>Kakka</em>) isn’t here!</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “K-Kakka?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “I thought I can meet her if I go to the Home Ec room! Her Highness wouldn’t pay me any mind recently!</p><p>I’m lonely! Does Her Highness hate me now?”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Umm, who’s Her Highness…?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Her Highness is Her Highness! I think she’s the president of the Cooking Club! Her name is Kasumi, so Kakka (<em>Her Highness</em>)!</p><p>And since you’re Chiyo, you’ll be Chicchi!</p><p>You’re my fellow Cooking Club member! A wolf from the same pack! I’ll protect you, Chicchi! Mggyuu~”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Don’t cling to me… There are kitchen knives lined up nearby. It’s dangerous.</p><p>But I’m a bit happy to be called by a nickname.</p><p>I didn’t know there was another first year girl in the Cooking Club.</p><p>I hope we can be friends. Can I call you Koharu-chan?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “You bet, Chicchi! Do as you like, Chicchi! I love you, Chicchi!”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “S-So loud… Ugh?

They’re colored differently, right?!”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Umm, I really don’t get this, but uh…</p><p>Koharu-chan, you seem to be clueless, so I’ll explain.</p><p>It seems in this Cooking Contest, we’ll need to gather the ingredients that have been spread throughout the Kimisaki Academy grounds first.</p><p>And then we’ll turn those ingredients into a dish.</p><p>That seems to be the basics in this Cooking Contest. Do you understand so far?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Gau, that sounds difficult~ Chicchi, you’re so smart! Chicchi, you’re so admirable!”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Did I even say anything that difficult…? Anyway, uh, it depends on the teams,</p><p>but it seems possible to split the roles of ‘cooking’ and ‘gathering ingredients’ between the two of us.</p><p>Basically, a pattern in which one hunts for the ingredients, and the other focuses on the cooking.</p><p>Of course, we can also choose to search for the ingredients and cook together.</p><p>There are all sorts of tactics. Which do you prefer, Koharu-chan?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Gau~? I don’t really get it, but it’s more fun to do things together than alone!”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Of course… You’re right…</p><p>We know nothing about the extent of each other’s capabilities, so let’s do this together and get to know one another while we’re at it.</p><p>No—let’s get along!</p><p>If we’re going to do this, of course we’ll want to win.</p><p>We can’t be losing in the Cooking Contest when we’re members of the Cooking Club.”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Gau~ I think you’re right, Chicchi~</p><p>I’ll follow your orders, Chicchi!

The Cooking Contest begins now! Goooo!”</p><p>The time is from now, until eight pm!</p><p>Exert your best efforts and cook up the best dish!

Don’t embrace me all of a sudden!”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Gauuuu…!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Wh-what? What’s wrong?”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Ah, it’s Kodama Hajime-senpai, from the Archery Club. So you’re participating in this Cooking Contest too, senpai…</p><p>Come on, Koharu-chan, don’t growl at her. You’re being rude.”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “But Chicchi! She’s a scary person! She’s a dangerous person! Gau, gau!”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Eh, I don’t think so…?</p><p>We’re sorry, Kodama-senpai. Now, Koharu-chan, don’t go saying strange things.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “It’s all right. I’m used to being misunderstood. There was a lot between me and Ougi-san in the past…</p><p>She seems to be scared of me.”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Huh? Kodama-senpai, do you and Koharu-chan know each other?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Yeah. But she’s not a bad girl, so please do get along with her~”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Ah, of course. We’re both in the Cooking Club, so I was thinking we could be friends.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Aah, so you ended up entering the Cooking Club…</p><p>When I heard you’re enrolling to Kimisaki, I thought you’d join Archery Club with me.</p><p>Ougi-san. Have you given up archery?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Fufu. It seems you really hate me.</p><p>Well, that’s fine with me.

This will be a good chance to test your capabilities.</p><p>I’m sorry, I didn’t have anyone else who would become my partner.</p><p>I don’t have anyone but you, Ichika.”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “Aah, me too! I’m the same, Onee-chan!</p><p>My world is complete with just ‘Onee-chan’ and ‘myself’!</p><p>But I’ll gather the ingredients at least… You’re a better cook than me, Onee-chan.</p><p>If we’re going to split the roles, isn’t it better to have you on the kitchen?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “I won’t force you to do what you don’t want, Ichika.</p><p>But if possible, I hope you’ll let me go with this plan. I think this is our best strategy towards victory right now.</p><p>It’s all right. I intend to win, as well.</p><p>I already promised Hii-chan I’d win.”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “I see… I trust you, Onee-chan!</p><p>Gather the ingredients and come back quick, please! I’ll take care of the preparations!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Okay… You two, you need to get a move or it’ll be over before you know it.”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Ah, yes. Let’s hurry, Koharu-chan.”</p><p>(I’m so jealous of Kodama-senpai’s team. They’re sisters, right?

Run, Chicchi! We’ll go anywhere, Chicchi!”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Wai… Stop…! Huff…</p><p>I’m supposed to be in the Cooking Club, so why have I been running so much?</p><p>Argh, my legs are getting needlessly hardened!</p><p>Not that I mind, I guess! Ehehe, it works as a diet exercise.</p><p>But Koharu-chan, the Cooking Contest supposedly extends for one, two…</p><p>For around five hours, you know?</p><p>We don’t have to be rushing so much.</p><p>If we use up all our stamina here, we won’t be able to cook later.”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Gau~? If that’s your judgment, Chicchi, then I’ll follow!</p><p>But speed is essential when hunting. If we don’t get the ingredients quick, the other guys will get to them first, you know?”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Well, I guess you’re right, but…</p><p>Even if we get too many ingredients, we won’t know what to do with them.

I love you, Chicchi!”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Geez, like I said, don’t keep hugging me… You’re making it hard for me to walk…”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Chicchi, I love how soft you are!

Do you do sports?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Gau~ Mostly hunting! I’m from a hunter tribe!</p><p>There’s jungle in Daddy’s native land, and I often played there as a kid!”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Is your Dad a foreigner, Koharu-chan?</p><p>Now that you mentioned it, you have a similar scent to Qoo-senpai… Are you an exchange student, or something?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Gau~ I go overseas and back a lot!</p><p>I’ve been in Japan longer, but people sometimes say my Japanese is weird~”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Aah… Well, you’re using ‘oira’ as your first person pronoun, too…</p><p>I see, I think I get you a bit now. But it’s reliable to know you can hunt! You seem like you’ll be good at gathering ingredients.”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Gau, gau! On that note, I’ll leave the cooking to you, Chicchi!</p><p>I’m good at handling preys and finding edible stuffs in the jungle, but…</p><p>Complicated cooking is too much for me! I’m not a picky eater, though; I can eat anything!</p><p>You can eat most living things if you grill them~”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Wow, wild… Ah, someone’s approaching.

Can you move from there?</p><p>I’m passing through! I can’t see in front of me well since I’m carrying the mountain of ingredients I’ve piled up. It’ll be a disaster if we crash!”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Whoa, that <em>is</em> a mountain!</p><p>The Cooking Contest has just started, and you’re gathering <em>that</em> many ingredients?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “You look unsteady! It’s because you’re too greedy! You’re gonna fall—should I carry half for you?”</p><p><strong>Mizuki:</strong> “Huh? That’s what you say, but you’re planning to steal my ingredients, aren’t you?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Rude! I’d never steal other people’s spoils! That goes against the way of hunters! Gau~!”</p><p><strong>Mizuki:</strong> “Wait, don’t jolt me around. Stop, I’m seriously gonna fall like that.</p><p>Well, whatever. I’m in a good mood today.</p><p>So let me tell you something good.

As if Onee-chan would be so underhanded!</p><p>You’re a snake, Vice-Captain! A lunchbox picker! A vile mother-in-law!”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “Who’s a mother-in-law…</p><p>Munch-munch… It’s a rather refined taste.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Fufu. We managed to finish our dishes early, so we made the lunch box with the materials lying around.</p><p>Container is important when it comes to food, after all…”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “Wait, even the <em>box</em> itself is handmade?</p><p>This isn’t about being intricate anymore…”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Fufu. I’ve always… been relied on for lots of stuffs, and worked hard to answer to them.</p><p>As a Living God. Even though I’m no god…</p><p>I used the power I’ve exhausted for ‘everyone’s sake’…</p><p>This time all for my own sake, for Hii-chan’s sake… I poured it all on cooking.</p><p>And then I ended up giving so much of my best, I even surprised myself.”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “Hmm. Then Kodama-senpai’s team can certainly win, without any complaints…</p><p>Even while carrying a handicap like Ichika-san, it’s admirable how you managed to perfect such masterpiece.”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “I’m not a handicap! I worked hard too!</p><p>Look! Even Transfer student-senpai is still eating while saying how delicious it is!”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “That man can eat pretty much anything…</p><p>Were you the one who cut the ingredients? It wasn’t a very good work…</p><p>This can subtract your score. If you don’t cut them all the same, the taste will dull too.”</p><p><strong>Ichika:</strong> “Ugh… You meanie! Onee-chaaaan!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Yes, yes. Your sister knows how hard you’ve worked, Ichika…”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “What a beautiful sisterly love. I am a slightly envious.</p><p>…Huh? What’s wrong, Mitsuru-senpai? You don’t look very well.”</p><p><strong>Mitsuru:</strong> “…! …!”</p><p><strong>Tomoko:</strong> “What? You were eating the Track Club’s curry, but it was so spicy you can’t open your mouth now?</p><p>Ah, you must’ve gotten a burnt… I’ll prepare some water, so please wait.”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “You all right, Mitchi? Can you work as an examiner in that state?</p><p>Eating spicy food can numb your tongue, you know?</p><p>Well, rather than that…</p><p>The Cooking Club president or whatever person who’s supposed to be the last examiner hasn’t showed up. I’m starting to get worried for real.</p><p>There are lots of dishes waiting to be tasted by her.</p><p>If she doesn’t taste them soon, the dishes will be cold. And the time for the Cooking Contest is running out.</p><p>If possible, I’d like to finish up with the examining quick, so we can count the scores for each team…</p><p>And announce the winner without having to make the participants wait.</p><p>Hmm… Things really haven’t gone well from the beginning to the end.</p><p>We can’t switch up the examiners this late too. What do we do?</p><p>Seriously. She should be responsible with the time!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ah… Mikage-san is an examiner too, huh?”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Hmm? Jime-jime, you sound like you’re acquainted with her.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Well, we had a little entanglement in the past… By the way, Mikage-san is right over there, you know?”</p><p><strong>Himari:</strong> “Eh, where? It’s so crowded I can’t tell. You have such good instincts, Jime-jime.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “It’s my redeeming trait.

That’s the sort of girl she is. She does have a reason.</p><p>Just like how someone with a perfect pitch feels like vomiting when they hear a discordant sound…</p><p>Mikage-san has an abnormal, almost sickly sense of taste, that’s preventing her from eating most food.</p><p>For her, who was born with a sense of taste so abnormal it goes beyond reason…</p><p>Just by eating food that doesn’t taste good, she’ll feel like vomiting, or get an attack of vertigo. She might even faint.</p><p>Her brain can’t take it. She kind of gets an eating disorder from that. When I first met her, she was so underweight—</p><p>As if she was only skin and bones. No; she was like a moving skeleton.</p><p>One’s sense of taste isn’t just defined by the tongue, but also the esophagus, and other senses comprised by the cells…</p><p>So even her stomach and everything else are especially sensitive, that her body absolutely can’t accept food that doesn’t taste good.</p><p>Her flesh can’t absorb any nutrient from food that isn’t delicious.</p><p>Even if she gets an IV vitamin infusion, her body won’t accept it and push it out, so it’s a really grave illness.</p><p>It’s like how we can’t eat stones or metals…</p><p>How even if we force ourselves to eat them, our bodies won’t be able to absorb them.</p><p>For her, most foods are filths she can’t put in her mouth.</p><p>But people can’t live on without eating. That’s why Mikage-san is always adjoined with death.</p><p>The reason she always takes things slowly is also mostly because she doesn’t have enough calories.</p><p>Because she can’t absorb food, her body at least pins down the dissipation of her energy by executing every action slowly.</p><p>Even so, she holds her grounds with the will to live.</p><p>Searching for a food, for a delicious food even <em>she</em> can eat.</p><p>That’s why she’s the president of the Cooking Club.</p><p>She’s always so desperately, struggling to death… searching for a delicious dish, day and night.</p><p>For her, ‘to live’ truly means ‘to eat’.</p><p>Mikage-san.</p><p>Would you eat the food I… the food my sister and I made?”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “I can’t save you.

I still think, from the bottom of my heart, that it’s great I have <em>you</em> as my partner, Koharu-chan.</p><p>I couldn’t have done anything by myself.</p><p>I’m a coward… I’ve always been such a doormat, wearing a forced smile while securing a safe position for myself…</p><p>I pretended to be mature, to be composed, even though I’m just a first year.</p><p>I was okay even if I failed at anything else. Because at least I have cooking; I’m good at cooking.</p><p>I made cooking my escape, withdrawing myself from everything else scary, everything else I don’t like.</p><p>But I’ll change. I’ll work hard on everything else, too. I want to live my youthful days with all I have.</p><p>If alone, if I’m by myself… I’ll be too dull to do anything.</p><p>But with you, Koharu-chan, and everyone else…</p><p>With everyone by my side, I don’t feel scared anymore. I don’t dislike it, I can live on proudly.”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Chicchi.”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “…Ahaha. I wonder what I’m saying. I’m really getting too excited… it feels strange.</p><p>But it’s so fun, for some reason!</p><p>If you find it as fun as me, Koharu-chan, I’ll be full too!”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “Oh my, oh my…</p><p>How can the chef let herself be full alone? I’m still hungry, you know~…?”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “President.</p><p>Please, taste it for us.”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “Sure thing. Bon appetit~…”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Wait.</p><p>Umm, Your Highness. You can’t eat that. It won’t be good.</p><p>You’ll vomit. You’ll suffer again, Your Highness.”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Koharu-chan…?</p><p>Why are you saying such thing? The both of us exerted our best efforts to make this dish, didn’t we?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “You didn’t do anything wrong, Chicchi. It’s my fault.</p><p>I dirtied your cooking, Chicchi. I made it all a waste. Everything’s my fault.</p><p>I’m sorry, Chicchi! I’m really sorry! I can’t apologize enough!”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Don’t apologize, Koharu-chan.</p><p><a href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/bc867429b95d88622551d66c177d890b/tumblr_inline_oet8zf8H0K1rr3xef_540.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="image" data-src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/bc867429b95d88622551d66c177d890b/tumblr_inline_oet8zf8H0K1rr3xef_540.jpg"></a></p><p>Say, Koharu-chan. You can’t taste things, right?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “You can only tell edamame and soybeans apart by their colors. You licked on the spices many times and tilted your head.</p><p>You look like the type who doesn’t care for details, yet you measured the spices so precisely.</p><p>While doing the pre-cooking and everything, you adhered perfectly to the recipe, perfectly to my instructions.</p><p>As if you’re scared of something. So thoroughly, so cautiously, without deviating an inch…</p><p>That’s because you couldn’t tell how they tasted with your tongue, right?</p><p>Without cooking perfectly like the recipe… The taste will be completely different. It won’t taste good.</p><p>That’s what you think, right, Koharu-chan?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Gau~…”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “That’s right. That’s why Koharu-ya-san can’t cook.</p><p>That’s why I said I didn’t expect anything from you, that it’s a waste of effort, right~…?</p><p>What a pity. Then I don’t suppose this needs tasting, huh~…?</p><p>You already gave up when you made this, thinking it wouldn’t taste good anyway, right?</p><p>It’ll taste even plainer than instant foods mass produced in factories, you know~?</p><p>But oh well, I’m a little hungry… Can I give this a little seasoning?</p><p>With my touch, even any filth can turn into a dish. Anything can become a <em>real</em> dish.</p><p>There is a territory you can never reach, even if you use up your entire life;</p><p>I’ll teach you about it, as the president of the Cooking Club…”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Stop. Don’t touch our cooking, please.</p><p>If you’ll touch it, do it only when you’re eating it. Don’t go changing the taste, please.</p><p>Koharu-chan, Prez. Don’t give up on this dish so easily.</p><p>We made this with all we had. I know, even if we packed our feelings, our love into it, that doesn’t change how a food tastes.</p><p>But there were people who became great musicians even though their ears couldn’t hear.</p><p>I covered for what Koharu-chan lacked. And what I didn’t have, Koharu-chan filled in my place.</p><p>That was how we made this dish.</p><p>Please eat it. I know you won’t regret it.”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “…</p><p>…Bon appetit.”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Yes, please eat to your fill.”</p><hr><h3 id="epilogue-2"><strong>Epilogue 2</strong></h3><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “Munch, munch.</p><p>…Oh my? Oh my, oh my?</p><p>I wonder why… this is a taste I miss. It feels like I have eaten this, a long time ago?”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Of course you have. Koharu-chan has always been helping you cook, hasn’t she, Prez?</p><p>Your techniques, the way you cook, have all soaked into Koharu-chan’s bones.</p><p>This is your flavor.</p><p>Your flavor that Koharu-chan loves… Your flavor that exists within her.</p><p>I was the one who decided what to make.</p><p>So I wanted to at least make the flavor match her ideals.</p><p>I’ve only just met Koharu-chan…</p><p>So I don’t know anything about her, but I want to be her friend. I want us to understand each other. We’ve become partners like it’s all fate, after all.</p><p>I’ve always been so passive. I only ever listen to what people tell me…</p><p>I’ve lived so far cautious of how people felt, what they thought, and what expression they had.</p><p>Even if just a little, I want to put my sad way of living into use.</p><p>I want to at least guide Koharu-chan to cook the flavor of her dreams.</p><p>If I can’t, that’s just too lonely. You can cook alone, but it’s happier to do it together.</p><p>I wanted to at least put our feelings into one as we cooked.</p><p>Believing we’d understand each other, we moved our hands. We made this with all we had.</p><p>I’ll say this as many times as you want. This is our dish that we wanted you to eat, Prez.</p><p>How did it taste?”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “…</p><p>You can try it yourself, you know~…?</p><p>You’re feeding it to someone else, so you should’ve test-tasted it, at least…”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Eh, it wasn’t good? Excuse me for a bit… munch, munch.</p><p>Mguh!? Ugh, this… the flavor’s all messed up…</p><p>We made it in hurry so the flavor is thin, and it doesn’t have a good texture too…</p><p>I-It’s not inedible, but…</p><p>U-Uugh! I’m so embarrassed! And I was telling you off so smugly…</p><p>I’m not good enough. I’m still so terrible at this. I’m inexperienced as a cook…”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “No.</p><p>You shouldn’t have to imitate ‘this part’ too, you know~…?”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “What?”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “In the past, I once ended up unable to eat anything…</p><p>So I ventured, in search of a dish, a flavor I could eat.</p><p>I traveled through the whole world. There’s someone rich that I know, so I had them support me financially.</p><p>In sought for an unknown flavor, I pushed my way through a jungle…</p><p>Where I met a girl like a wild ape, who had never even licked a spice before.</p><p>At that time, I was such a terrible cook…</p><p>After all, my arms were as thin as bones, I couldn’t even lift up a pot. Just cooking for a few minutes made me out of breath.</p><p>But that girl waited for me, with sparkling eyes.</p><p>She helped me. She ate the food I made, praising how delicious it was.</p><p>You made me recall that, a bit…</p><p>Memories and feelings, they aren’t necessary in making delicious food.</p><p>They’re not… supposed to affect how the food fundamentally tastes.</p><p><a href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/fde33c10e69e4b530acbde6ff5b792f4/tumblr_inline_oet91rkbLC1rr3xef_540.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="image" data-src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/fde33c10e69e4b530acbde6ff5b792f4/tumblr_inline_oet91rkbLC1rr3xef_540.jpg"></a></p><p>How strange… Why am I crying…?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Your Highness.”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “I’m sorry, ‘Koharu-chan’. It was my fault that you lost your sense of taste.</p><p>I studied cuisine, started making more and more delicious dishes… and I kept feeding them to you.</p><p>I was so happy because you’d look so delighted…</p><p>But your sense of taste couldn’t stand my cooking, that was getting more and more extreme in taste and far-reachingly delicious…</p><p>I broke you.</p><p>Sooner or later, you’d turn just like me…</p><p>You wouldn’t be able to eat any kind of food with a smile. Worse yet, you won’t be able to accept them, and just vomit everything.</p><p>Unable to eat anything, you’ll starve, dry up and die.</p><p>I wanted to part from you before that happens. Why did you have to chase after me, you foolish girl…</p><p>You were my first customer ever, that I met deep in the jungle.”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “Your Highness…?”</p><hr><h3 id="epilogue-3"><strong>Epilogue 3</strong></h3><p><a href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/5dbfff78810ffd2c068b69474be62870/tumblr_inline_oet957PXDt1rr3xef_540.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="image" data-src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/5dbfff78810ffd2c068b69474be62870/tumblr_inline_oet957PXDt1rr3xef_540.jpg"></a></p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “Thank you for the food. Aah, I couldn’t even eat most of it, and I feel so full, somehow. Thank you, both of you.</p><p>But I can’t give this dish a score.</p><p>It’s mostly a failed dish. If we gather up all the examiners’ scores…</p><p>Miss Shrine Maiden would be the winner, I suppose.</p><p>We the Cooking Club can’t obtain the money prize of ten million yen.</p><p>Well, I suppose that doesn’t matter. Giving up on everything like in the past…</p><p>Relying on the power of money, and seeking for a gourmet delicacy in the wide world… I don’t need to do all of that anymore.</p><p>It seems like you two… will be able to present me a delicious food in the near future.</p><p>Kukuku! <em>Cooking</em>! I’m expecting a lot from you, Chiyo-ya-san, Koharu-ya-san!</p><p>Satisfy me, the most selfish and picky customer in the entire world, okay?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “G-Gau! I don’t really get it, but I’ll work hard!</p><p>Because I want you to keep smiling, Your Highness! I’ll always love you, Your Highness!</p><p>I’m kind of useless, but if it’s with Chicchi, I feel we can make something delicious!</p><p>So please wait for us! We’ll definitely fill your stomach soon!”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “I’ll work hard too! Prez, thank you very much for eating our cooking…”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “Kufufu. Make it as fast as possible, okay? Before I die from starvation…</p><p>I hope you’ll at least be able to make something of ‘this level’~</p><p>Abracadabra~…”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “There it is, Her Highness’s seasoning! It’s really like magic! It’s awesome no matter how many times I’ve seen it!”</p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “Eh, what did you just do? It looked like you just gave our cooking a little touch…?”</p><p><strong>Koharu:</strong> “You can taste it yourself, Chicchi. Open your mouth, aa~n…”</p><p><a href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/568e385a21b8ffdac99f09297b7334aa/tumblr_inline_oet93wKmZh1rr3xef_540.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="image" data-src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/568e385a21b8ffdac99f09297b7334aa/tumblr_inline_oet93wKmZh1rr3xef_540.jpg"></a></p><p><strong>Chiyo:</strong> “<em>Munch</em>… Eh, what in the world?</p><p>What the… H-How?</p><p>Even though it was just someone heartless and mean like the Prez, giving the dish some random touch…</p><p>How did it become so delicious?</p><p>It’s yummy, it’s so yummy! It’s turned so good! I’m so frustrated!</p><p>Munch, munch… Uuh! Uwaaaah, it’s so goooood!”</p><p><strong>Kasumi:</strong> “Cooking is about love. Cooking is about chemistry. And lastly, cooking is about magic~…</p><p>But you can’t cry. You’ll change how the food tastes with the salt in your tears.</p><p>Don’t cry, and keep holding your ground without hesitation… Level up.

First of all, I’ll aim for this flavor!</p><p>And someday, I’ll overtake it… I’ll show you I can make even tastier food!</p><p>Let’s work hard together, Koharu-chan! Wait for us, Prez!</p><p>I’ll show you I can make food that’s much more delicious than this!</p><p>Bon appetit…!”</p>]]></content>

Lately it doesn’t matter how much I slept, I just couldn’t shake off my sleepiness. Gosh, I’m not supposed to be that old yet…</p><p>…Mggha!?</p><p>Wha—hey, don’t pinch my nose! Don’t shake me! I get it, I’m waking up!</p><p>Geez. Couldn’t you wake me up a little more gently…? What’s up, seriously…?</p><p>You’ve got some guts to mess with me. Who is it — Chizuru? Kuro? Angie…?</p><p>Hmm? Huh, who the heck…?</p><p>Sorry, do you see a pair of glasses anywhere around there? Real round ones… I can’t see anything without my glasses, okay?</p><p>Aah, thanks. That’s the glasses. Pass that to me already, quick!</p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/SRAesXW.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="Intimacy Yako" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/SRAesXW.jpg"></a></p><p>All right, got my sight restored!</p><p>…Sorry, seems I was half-asleep. Dreamed about the past and stuff. I shouldn’t have slept on the rooftop, huh? <em>Yawn</em>…</p><p>Hmm? I looked prettier without my glasses, you say? We just met and you have the cheek to flirt with me, brat? You’re my junior, aren’t you?</p><p>…Okay, before that, who the heck are you, seriously?</p><p>Sorry. I think I’m seriously still half-asleep. I don’t really grasp the situation… I stayed up late yesterday preparing for our next stage, so I’ve been skipping classes to sleep the whole day.</p><p>Yeah, I’m part of the Drama Club. I take care of the production and all of those behind-the-scene stuffs myself; so doesn’t matter if the sun’s up or down, there’s always a pile of work to dive in.</p><p>…Say, haven’t we met before?</p><p>Hmm, no? You sure? I feel differently, though…</p><p>Anyway, that there’s a boy in our school means—you’re the rumored “Transfer student-kun”, aren’t you?</p><p>I see, so you’re the guy…</p><p>Say, you got any interest in acting? Our Drama Club is lacking actors, see. It’s a given but we’re especially short on male roles, and it‘s not like we can ask the teachers either, right?</p><p>Hmm, what? You’re giving me coffee?</p><p>Thanks… This will be a good eye-opener. Gulp~</p><p>You’re quite the thoughtful one, Transfer student. Can’t you help our club out, even with just the small tasks? I mean, seriously.</p><p>Oh, right. Do you have some business with me?</p><p>Hmm. So Chizuru was looking for me? She said I might be on the rooftop, so you’ve come to check? I see, thanks for your hard work.</p><p>Wait, it’s this hour already! Damn, I overslept! Thanks a bunch for waking me up, I’ve got work waiting for me so I’m going on ahead!</p><p>I’ll return the favor if I remember! Let me repay you for the coffee, at least.</p><p>Okay… Catch you later, then, Transfer student~”</p>]]></content>

    <title>★NOV4 | Crosstalk</title>
    <url>/2016/es-nov4-crosstalk/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The extra story from the fourth novel, “Ensemble Stars! May This Singing Voice Reach the Heavens”, narrated by the friend of the transfer student</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="crosstalk">Crosstalk</h2><p>In the end, I couldn’t talk with her, huh?</p><p>Perhaps it couldn’t have been helped; it just means this isn’t the right time yet. Or it might mean that girl and I would never cross paths for the second time, maaybe? We’re not family. And of course, we’re not lovers. Perhaps we weren’t even friends – I may have no right to call myself her friend.</p><p>All we did was share a brief moment together like a miracle — enjoyed, a youth together. Maybe what we had was a feeble relationship, that would just be forgotten once we become adults.</p><p>But still. It’s a little lonely, after all.</p><p>I am glad, though. I could see her face, even if just for a little. That girl might not realize it herself, but she was wearing such a good, fulfilled expression on her. Laughed, cried – crumpled that cute face of hers to her fill… even though she had been such a silent, expressionless girl who rarely showed off her individuality.</p><p>She was able to release her true face.</p><p>She’s enjoying her youth in full speed.</p><p>That’s great.</p><p>I don’t resent her a single bit. For leaving us behind, betraying us to be happy all on her own—I guess if I say I’ve never thought of that even just once, that’d be a lie.</p><p>But compared to having everyone end up unhappy. Compared to having all the flowers stepped on, plucked from their roots, leaving only a desert where not even grasses grow… Compared to such a hopeless end—</p><p>I know I prefer seeing at least <em>you</em> alone become happy.</p><p>I wonder why she transferred… Why she disappeared from before us without leaving a single word. I still haven’t figured it out. I considered asking, but looking at her surrounded by a sight out of a dream I thought, maaybe it would be tasteless to pour cold water into that new life.</p><p>I mean, flowers won’t bloom if you pour too much water, right?</p><hr><p>“Hey, hey. Are you okay~?”</p><p>Right outside of Yumenosaki Academy’s auditorium. Next to a booth where tickets are checked and a lineup of goods are sold, I tilt my head to the side, mouthing a troubled hum.</p><p>With the audience repeatedly calling for encore, singing voices continue to reverberate endlessly. It seems they’re called “Trickstar” – the group of boys that girl has apparently formed a precious bond with; they’re performing to their fill.</p><p>Their melody has completely stuck onto my ears.</p><p>This is the ensemble that girl has found in Yumenosaki Academy. This is a story from a far and different world, that I have no right in participating; but I’ve been able to contact just a tiny fragment of it.</p><p>I’ve successfully confirmed that girl is smiling here.</p><p>I was about to satisfy myself with that result and go home for the day to rest in bed, but…</p><p>“I wonder what’s wrong? Anemia, maaybe…?”</p><p>On that merchandise booth, there’s a boy leaning on a pipe chair unmoving like a marionette with his strings cut off. I think he’s fainted. I would’ve left him alone if he was just having a relaxed nap; in fact, it would’ve been terrible of me to interrupt him in the middle of his rest, but… <em>this</em> kind of smells serious.</p><p>I think he’s more passed out than sleeping.</p><p>He might’ve lost consciousness out of nowhere, because the desk has collapsed from the impact of his own fall, messing the goods all over the place… it’s like there’s just been a robbery. Actually, maybe there <em>was</em> a robbery. This smells like a case, and I’d rather not get involved.</p><p>Yet I can’t just leave him be.</p><p>“Ooi? Are you alive~?”</p><p>I crouch down and shake the boy. I’m not particularly against touching a member of the opposite sex—but it’s certainly been a while, so it kinda feels funny. Was this how boys feel like? He’s kind of needlessly bony or more like… he’s so thin I feel he hasn’t been eating properly.</p><p>Hair like the wet feathers of a crow. The Yumenosaki uniform he wears is worn down all over the place.</p><p>He’s a beautiful boy. Maaybe this boy’s an idol too? Yumenosaki Academy is a vocational school specializing in raising male idols, from the story. It’s just neighbor from my school, but the Idol Course is particularly strict with security… you can’t get close to it carelessly so I don’t know it well.</p><p>So close yet so far. That’s why we didn’t notice how close that girl had actually been. She had transferred without saying anything to anyone—so I thought she’d gone somewhere faraway, beyond our arms’ reach.</p><p>Even today, I had spotted her by complete chance. I’ve become estranged from the close friends I had back when she was still around — because, something really sad happened. But I get lonely when I have no one around, so I keep lots of acquaintances.</p><p>And friends too, lots of them. One of them loves idols, so she visits Yumenosaki quite often – and I just joined in her the spur of the moment. Bringing acquaintances and friends along, we came to make a ruckus and enliven the place.</p><p>I like that sort of thing. Because without recoloring it all with fun, with foolish enough racket, I feel I won’t be able to hide that heavy pain we all experienced.</p><p>I form wide and shallow relationships like an escape. I laugh for everyone else’s share too, guide myself to happiness, and continue to acclaim high and loud how wonderful life is – even if that’s just what I forced myself to believe.</p><p>And to think there’s a girl who can never smile for the second time too.</p><p>Hey, that’s why I’m a traitor like you.</p><p>I can’t call myself your friend anymore, can I?</p><p>But you know. I wanted to be useful, even if just a little. I wanted to help you smile. That’s why I cheered for you all the way. You, as you danced and sang hiding your face behind a mask. As always, you squash yourself into nothing, acting the part of a supporting role or even a prop — yet behind that, you continue to help people.</p><p>I want to support you, even if just a little. You made me want to cheer for you.</p><p>I’m glad it went somewhat well. Sure, I know I might not have made such huge change—I’m always that way. But I want to think it’s better than having done nothing at all. I don’t mind even if you don’t notice, even if I don’t get anything from this.</p><p>I loved you. You were my precious friend.</p><p>No… always and forever, I shouldn’t make the friendship that should’ve existed between us, the youth we experienced together — sound like they never existed, should I? Those brilliant days I spent with you were precious to me, so I returned the favor. As proof of my friendship with you, I helped you.</p><p>And now with that deed of self-satisfaction as my pillow, I’m going to return to the place I belong.</p><hr><p>“What are you doing there?”</p><p>A deep voice, like a pipe organ, intervenes.</p><p>I look up in my surprise, to suddenly find someone standing nearby. I personally find his features mature. He’s tall, and I think I wouldn’t have guessed he’s around my age had it not been for that sea blue Yumenosaki uniform he wears…</p><p>His slit eyes are terribly sexy, like a male role in a Takarazuka play. His hair is like a batch of first-class feathers, cut and styled short. Despite being tall, he’s less oppressive and more—delicate, he really makes you want to hug him. And for some reason, he’s holding a lovely antique doll on one hand.</p><p>It’s curious to see a man carrying a doll around, but Yumenosaki today is quite festive; there are lots of people in fancy costumes and idol outfits running around… so I don’t find it <em>particularly</em> strange.</p><p>That curious man is glaring at me quite harshly. Without saying a word. All the while feeling uneasy, I still look up to him with a smile.</p><p>Unexpectedly enough, no matter how scary one may seem, as long as they’re human like you and me, they’d respond the gesture if you address them with a smile. Because no one would have the heart to throw an innocent baby to the ground.</p><p>Yes, that’s how I’ve lived. While wearing a stupid grin. Endearing myself to people and clinging onto their pity.</p><p>I’ve had people threaten me to not pretend the cute girl. Had cruel things done to me too—but this is the single weapon I, who can’t do much of anything, have learned to use.</p><p>In order to live on.</p><p>“Umm, hello. Could you maaybe know this boy? As you see… he’s passed out here! I wonder what’s wrong… is he okay, maaybe? I’m worried!”</p><p><em>“Hehe. It’s okay, I think it’s just anemia. Mika-chan… that’s this boy’s name—he doesn’t eat a lot. It seems he’s been working part-time the whole day too; he seems to have passed out from the exhaustion and lack of nutrition. Geez, what a troublesome boy~”</em></p><p>Hmm? I think this man just spoke in a strangely high voice without moving his mouth?</p><p>What’s this, ventriloquism…?</p><p>I watch the tall man curiously, when he lifts up the boy called Mika-chan (<em>it sounds a little too adorable a name for a boy… is it his nickname, maaybe?</em>) as if the other doesn’t weigh much, with just a single arm. He effortlessly holds the boy and walks away.</p><p>He’s just like a kind father giving his sleeping son a piggyback home.</p><p>“Excuse me… should I help you carry him?”</p><p>I call out to the man’s back in unintended polite language—and he turns around.</p><p>“I can carry him all by myself, so your concern is unnecessary… You came here to watch the live, didn’t you? <em>That</em> vulgar comedy drama without a tint of artistic value? Then you should pay no mind to us, and just head back to the auditorium. Apologies. It seems we’ve ended up taking your time.”</p><p>“Mm… not at all, maaybe? It’s just natural to be worried over someone who’s passed out… and I’m just about to go home, anyway. My house is far, so I commute with train—if I miss the scheduled train, maaybe I won’t be able to go home.”</p><p>It’s still April. The year’s just changing, and it’s been a little busy around me. My friends who came with me are still watching the live, but I turned them down to go home on my own. If possible, I wish I could enjoy more of the singing voice of that group “Trickstar”, that that girl is related to.</p><p>But I started feeling kind of blue… and the friends I came with, they weren’t the sort I’d stick with around the clock—I think, I’ve had enough of that, actually.</p><p>Getting too deeply involved just makes the wound of separation graver.</p><p>I’m weak, so I can’t stand something like that for the second time.</p><p>“Umm, I think it’s called a merchandise booth, maaybe? Is it okay to leave it empty? There’s a cash register and everything… the money inside might get stolen?”</p><p>I follow after the man who heads to the gate, calling out to him as I too walk to exit the place. The man appears irritated; without looking back, he indifferently murmurs,</p><p>“Like I care. The patrolling student council members should notice and deal with it soon. In the first place, there should be other kids besides Kagehira attending the place—so if it’s empty, it must mean they’ve abandoned their job to peek at the live in the auditorium. As if I can stand seeing my Kagehira being worked around for what such kids should be paid for. They’re certainly cheeky for a bunch of vulgar fools.”</p><p>“Hmm… I don’t really get it, but you seem to cherish that boy a lot~”</p><p>“Hmph. If there’s a doll threatening to jump into a puddle of mud by itself, is it not the duty of the owner to retrieve it by the nape of its neck?”</p><p>“Doll? Ah, that doll of yours is really cute! What’s her name?”</p><p>“Mademoiselle. Hmph, she is, is she not? She is certainly the cutest.”</p><p>While we’ve started weaving a normal, casual chat somehow, the fainted boy named “Mika-chan” lets out a unique moan like a crow’s cry, as his eyes blink open.</p><p>“Nggha, huh? Oshi-san, why’re ya ‘ere…?”</p><p>Seeing his eyes, I’m a little taken aback. Each of his eyeballs are of different color. I think it’s called odd-eye?—I’ve heard there’s a different name for when the phenomenon occurs in humans.</p><p>Among my precious friends, there’s also one with similar eyes. She’s been in low spirits and prone to shutting herself in now, so I haven’t seen her face in a while. But it’s a pretty rare phenomenon, so I hadn’t thought there’d be another one with the same condition—I end up staring at him hard.</p><p>Noticing my stare, the man called Oshi-san mutters in a low voice,</p><p>“Try not to stare at him too much. Kagehira hates that—and it scares him.”</p><p>“Ah, okay. You see, I have a friend with eyes like that too. And well, that girl~ She hates it too, when people look at her eyes. They’re so pretty though! Don’t you think so too, maaybe? Oshi-san?”</p><p>“I don’t believe we’re related in any form that’d make you call me Oshi-san. Actually, why are you following us? Do you not care for the concert?”</p><p>“I was thinking to go home too, maaybe~? There was someone I’d like to meet—but she seemed really busy, so maaybe I shouldn’t force it. I guess… it’s okay.”</p><p>After I tell him so in a dejected voice, Oshi-san seems like he’s about to say something, when—</p><p>A shout strikes me from behind.</p><p>Startled, I turn around.</p><hr><p>On the exit of the auditorium we’ve moved a slight distance from—the huge door that’s been closed due to the concert opens just a bit, and <em>that girl</em> shows her face. The girl who was once my friend.</p><p>In my shock, I stand still, unable to even call for her name. Meanwhile, Oshi-san and Mika-chan—the curious pair melts into the darkness of the night and vanishes. What a wondrous duo; I wish I could’ve talked to them more, but more than that—</p><p>Right now, I smile to that girl who’s running up to me, panting heavily.</p><p>“Umm, hey, it’s been a while~ Or maaybe it hasn’t been that long?”</p><p>Without replying, that girl rushes up to me and embraces me.</p><p>Whoa—I nearly fall from that, so I hold my ground by clinging onto the lamp post nearby. She’s as unexpectedly funky in her actions, as always. Cute.</p><p>As I watch her in nostalgia, she bursts into huge globs of tears. Gasping, trying to say so many things but failing to say anything, opening and closing her mouth repeatedly. She’s really bad at talking.</p><p>Even though that’s the sort of girl you are—you danced in front of a huge crowd for the sake of your comrades, the friends you’ve discovered here. Wearing a mask, unmindful to those who think of you as a clown.</p><p>You, who typically try to act cool… Wasn’t that, maaybe, a wonderful thing?</p><p>All the while sobbing, she begins babbling in incoherent sentences;</p><p>She thanks me for cheering on her with my friends. Even though she feels she doesn’t have the face to talk to me—even despite that, she’s come to meet me, prepared to be scorned.</p><p>She’s searched all over for me and stopped me at the very end—and apologized.</p><p><em>I’m sorry, I’m sorry,</em> she repeats… You shouldn’t have to apologize to someone like me. Isn’t today supposedly a day to celebrate?</p><p>I want you to smile—you know, I really <em>loove</em> your smile.</p><p>Thinking that, I pat her head. I hold her close, sharing my warmth.</p><p>But, it doesn’t seem like she’s trying to relieve herself of her burdens by apologizing—it’s like she’s trying to hurt herself, piercing herself with knives. Self-punishment. Self-harm. And I can’t stand to see that, so I shout at the top of my lungs like an idiot:</p><p>“Today was suuuch a blast! That concert really moved me!”</p><p>I tell her, then I hold her for one last time, before parting.</p><p>I wish you’d forget all about the past and just move forward.</p><p>“Thanks a lot,”</p><p>I say. While I feel sorry for her, I tear her away from me and step back. I turn my back on her and head to the gate. I’ll head to my place to return.</p><p>So you should too.</p><p>“Let’s catch up again sometimes, maaybe. You haven’t changed your numbers, right?”</p><p>I try to confirm that just in case, and she nods her head so many times I start feeling sorry.</p><p>You could’ve afforded to be more arrogant. I don’t really get it, but you’ve become a ‘producer’, haven’t you? Someone who protects idols, supports and guides them…</p><p>So you should wipe your tears, and wear a tough, strong and beautiful smile, that’s just like you.</p><p>Do your best. No… enjoy your youth. I’ll do that too.</p><p>“See you later.”</p><p>I wave my hand and say my good bye. I have to go back to that close yet far place we belong.</p><p>You know, if our paths could intersect by coincidence like today—</p><p>If we could meet sometimes and exchange words and share laughs, that’d be great.</p><p>As I think that, I walk without looking back. Partings are always so hard and painful and unbearable. But I know we can meet again as long as we’re alive. I believe we can.</p><p>So you know. I’m sure there’s no need to worry about anything.</p><p>For just one last time, I turn around and smile.</p><p>She, too, frantically rubs her eyes and forces herself to respond with a smile.</p><p>Goodbye.</p><p>See you later.</p><p>Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Translator’s Note:</strong> Going by her verbal tic of ～かなって, her personality and backstory, the unnamed narrator is presumably <a href="http://ensemble-girls.wikia.com/wiki/Chizuru_Yakumo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yakumo Chizuru</a>.

    <content><![CDATA[<div class="note warning"><p>Partial translation.</p></div><p>It’s probably my favorite scene from the event, so I felt like translating it just for personal satisfaction.</p><a id="more"></a><hr><h2 id="prisoner-s-love-3">Prisoner’s Love / 3</h2><p><strong>Written by:</strong> Akira<br><strong>Timeline:</strong> Summer</p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/gnXQe8u.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="Prisoner's Love 1" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/gnXQe8u.jpg"></a></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yuuki. I want you to answer honestly.</p><p>I am — <em>we</em> are your friends, aren’t we?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eh? Yeah. Of course. Hidaka-kun and everyone in Trickstar are my precious friends.</p><p>You’re my comrades; we share a common destiny… We share an indissoluble connection. I love you guys.”</p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/kL2FveP.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="Prisoner's Love 2" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/kL2FveP.png"></a></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Thank you. I’m happy. But that’s why, please don’t hold things in.</p><p>Be more assertive. Say whatever you want.</p><p>You don’t need to endure. Say it’s painful if you’re in pain… Tell us if you’re suffering.</p><p>I’m dense, so I can’t guess your feelings for you.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No, no, that’s not true! Hidaka-kun, you’ve been caring for all of us as Trickstar’s leader, especially recently!</p><p>And you used to be such mood killer!</p><p>How about you, Hidaka-kun? Aren’t you the one enduring things? Are you okay?</p><p>We were the one who forcefully pushed the leader role to you, so don’t be so harsh on yourself.</p><p>Me, I’m all right. Look, I’m so energetic, aren’t I?</p><p>I can’t keep whining too. I’m incompetent compared to the rest of Trickstar! So I need to work hard, even if I vomit blood!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yuuki, don’t misunderstand. Do you think… we’ll ever say you’re unneeded in Trickstar because you’re incompetent?</p><p>Do you think we’ll ever cast you away heartlessly, in a purely business-like manner?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Maybe I don’t have the right to say this. Tempted by the Student Council President’s sweet words, I’ve once separated from you guys.</p><p>At that time, having been told the idol side of me would benefit from it in the future…</p><p>I complied. Through an unfeeling calculation, I decided on the optimal solution, like a machine.</p><p>But I was wrong.</p><p>Even if the calculation had been correct, it was the worst answer I could’ve gone with as a human being.</p><p>I’ve been regretting it since. I might have returned to you guys, but I’m not so shameless to think I was forgiven or redeemed.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hidaka-kun… No one cares about that anymore.</p><p>There was nothing you could’ve done in that situation. No one blamed you. There’s a kind of current you can’t overcome, no matter how hard you plant your feet on the ground.</p><p>And even if you were to go against it, normally, you’ll just be washed away and pulverized without trace.</p><p>And yet Trickstar resurrected like a phoenix, created a miracle and won DDD.</p><p>Normally, that’s something impossible. Trickstar’s so amazing…</p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/MUA22dA.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="Prisoner's Love 3" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/MUA22dA.png"></a></p><p>That’s why I want to treasure you; I don’t want to lose you all. Thinking that way, I’ve been clinging desperately onto you. Was it unsightly?</p><p>If that’s so, you could’ve told me. I’ll be lonely, but…</p><p>If you think I’m not of any use, of any help to Trickstar, you can throw me away. I’ll keep supporting you from afar.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “None of us have said anything of that sort. Have we ever called you useless… said we didn’t need you, even once, Yuuki?</p><p>You’re an important part of us. There’s nothing that you lack.</p><p>No, even if you <em>do</em> lack something, we can cover that for you.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I’d feel sorry to be your burden like that.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Even I, Akehoshi and Isara — each of us all has something we lack, even if the degree varies.</p><p>Haven’t we been filling for and supporting each other, advancing forward that way, until now?</p><p>If you think you’re just leaning on us one-sidedly, just being nothing but a burden…</p><p>That’s conceited, Yuuki. Don’t make fool of us. We all love you too.</p><p>Yuuki. At least I, <em>we</em>, hadn’t wanted to become like the people who hurt you… The last thing we wanted was to force you to endure.</p><p>We don’t want to push you to your limits. We don’t want to hurt you.</p><p>So please, seriously… Don’t think about being a burden or whatever and just say what you want.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I’m okay, you know… Hidaka-kun?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Enough. Sorry for talking weird before the stage.</p><p>When everyone’s back, let’s rehearse the stage with them.</p><p>We still have mountains of problems; let’s perfect our performance before the real deal. I’m counting on you, Yuuki.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Y-Yeah. I don’t know if someone like me can be of any use, but I’ll be giving my all.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yuuki. Once Starmine’s over, maybe at a later date…</p><p>Let’s all enjoy the summer festival together. Wear yukata, drop by food stands to stuff our cheeks full and just relax.</p><p>I’ll adjust our schedules somehow. It’ll cause no problems. I’m good at calculation.</p><p>That’s why. I’ll say this as your leader: focus and give the performance your best shot.</p><p>You’ve been wearing a fake smile the whole day.</p><p>Honestly, don’t go showing the audience that kind of forced smile.”</p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/jNZrSyx.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="Prisoner's Love 4" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/jNZrSyx.png"></a></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “…I’ve been smiling properly, haven’t I?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “If that’s what you think, then your illness is grave. I’m going to sound like Akehoshi here, but you’re not sparkling <em>at all</em>.</p><p>We or Sena-senpai would notice with just a glance.</p><p>If that’s what you call a smile… you may as well say I’m a clown who’s always laughing like an idiot.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “…”</p><hr><p>Another one; this time just a snippet of conversation. I like this conversation between Akiomi and Anzu.</p><h2 id="epilogue-1-snippet">Epilogue 1 (Snippet)</h2><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/y9fUDju.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="A Midsumer Night's Dream - Akiomi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/y9fUDju.jpg"></a></p><p><strong>Akiomi:</strong> “Anzu-san, you’re still a child, as well. And until half a year ago, you’ve been just one of the common people… So maybe it’s cruel of me to say this, but you’ll have to get used to it:</p><p>You’ll have to get used to being <em>hated</em>. To forcing unreasonable things and getting despised for it. After all, you’re a “producer”.</p><p>Just like a teacher like myself, you are in a different position from them. If you think what you will do will end up being for the idols’ sake…. then you must unhesitatingly realize that thinking.</p><p>Just like what you’ve done this time. What is your job? Is it to be friends with the idols? Is it to be loved and pampered by them? That’s not it, is it? “Producer”-san, you mustn’t make having them like you your goal.</p><p>Support them, protect them from all the malice in the world, and make them shine the brightest. And for that sake, you mustn’t fear of having them despise you. I know it’s not such an easy thing to do. But even if they may hate you now… I’m sure, in the distant future, they’ll be grateful to you.</p><p>With that hope in mind, turn yourself into a demon and play the part of a villain. That, too, is a way of loving someone.</p><p>Well, I know it must be difficult. Just like how they’re idols and high school boys at the same time, you too are a producer…</p><p>And a high school girl in her adolescence all the same.”</p><p>(from <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream / Epilogue 1</em>)</p>]]></content>

I still can’t decide if it’s better to leave it be or translate it.<br>[4] Shuu’s “Sovereign”: It’s 帝王 <em>teiou</em> which I guess would easily translate into Emperor, but Eichi already has that title (皇帝 <em>koutei</em>), so I went for Sovereign… at least for until I see someone else come up with something better.</p><hr><h2 id="kagehira-mika">Kagehira Mika</h2><h3 id="a-scarecrow-s-desire">A Scarecrow’s Desire</h3><p><strong>Unlock requirement:</strong> Kagehira Mika’s Affection Level 3</p><p><strong>&gt; Handicrafts Club room</strong></p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/jTHtbkr.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Oshi-saaan?</p><p>Oh, so you’re really ‘ere! I asked some guys from your class and they said you probably went to the clubroom…</p><p>What’re ya doin’? A job came for us for the first in a while, y’know?”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> [Please be quiet, Mika-chan.</p><p>Shuu-kun won’t hear you even if you talk to him right now.]</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Ah, Mado-nee! Aww, you’re wearin’ another new clothes! So cute!”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> [Thank you. Isn’t it nice? Anzu-chan made it for me!]</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Hmm? Why’s Anzu-chan… no, the ‘Producer’ girl… here? You usually never let anyone in, Oshi-san!</p><p>Oi oi, Anzu-chan! Whaddya want with the Handicrafts Club? Or what, you plannin’ to order Valkyrie ‘round too? You think you’re so great!</p><p>Hngh? Aah, you poured tea for me? Thanks a lot for the trouble…</p><p>D-Don’t go usin’ stuff in the clubroom! You piss me off, geez!”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> [You’re wasting your breath denying her, Mika-chan. Anzu-chan seems to be quite the spunky girl, you see…</p><p>Shuu-kun said all sorts of mean things to her, but she just brushed it all off.]</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Ugh… What’re you doin’ anyway, Anzu-chan…? You’re makin’ some weird pose in front of Oshi-san… Hurt anywhere? Wanna go to the infirmary?</p><p>Hmm. You’re modelin’ for Oshi-san? No, a bit wrong? I don’t get it; I’m dumb!</p><p>Aah, okay… Uh-huh… I see, gotcha. Anzu-chan, you came ‘ere to know what’s the handicrafts club like?</p><p>Now that you said it, joinin’ a club’s mandatory in Yumenosaki, eh?</p><p>You were told you didn’t need to hurry, but you wanted to place your aim – I see.</p><p>So you’re going ‘round checkin’ all the clubs?</p><p>I see… Yeah, Yumenosaki Academy’s idol course is basically an all-boys school, after all. The clubs’re mostly stuffs boys would like. Sports club would be tough on you, eh?</p><p>What ‘bout handicrafts club, then? It’s pretty relaxed; we’re all just crafting stuffs we like when we like.</p><p>It doesn’t stink too much like male sweat either, eh? We’ll welcome a girl, arms wide open!</p><p>Wait, no! The ‘producer’ – Anzu-chan, you’re an enemy! You’re plannin’ to mix in with us and stab us in the back when we’re not payin’ attention, right!?</p><p>You ain’t foolin’ me!</p><p>Hmm? Aah, I’m awful at sewin’ compared to Oshi-san… I like to gather stuffs rather than making stuffs.</p><p>See all the stuffed dolls over there? I picked them up from dump sites and fixed ‘em up neat.</p><p>I like that sorta thin’. I’m bad at creatin’ stuffs from one, y’know?</p><p>Yeah. The clothes that teddy bear’s wearin’ was made by Oshi-san. Cute, ain’t it? I’d feel sorry to have it stay naked forever.</p><p>Hmm? The stuffs that look like cursed items over there are my personal belongings… I love scary stuffs as much as cute stuffs.</p><p>If they’re cute <em>and</em> scary at the same time, that’s just perfect!</p><p>No one gets me, though. I wonder why?</p><p>When you find somethin’ scary, doesn’t it feel the same as when you find somethin’ cute?</p><p>Well, they’re the same for me, anyway. Like, my heart beats fast and clenches! Get me? Ya don’t?</p><p>Ugh… That’s okay. If you just went ‘I get you!’ there, that’ll stink like lies. Oshi-san’s the only one who understands me!”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “Kagehira. Keep it down with your rambling.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Argh, sorry, Oshi-san! I know you told me I talk too much, but I keep forgettin’ ‘bout it!</p><p>Rather than it slippin’ from my memories, it‘s more like my brain tissues themselves are slipping!”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “I’ll stitch your head later, so quiet down for a few minutes.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Oshi-san, what’re ya doin’? Seems you’re makin’ Anzu-chan do some weird pose, but is she modelin’ for ya?</p><p>Cute clothes, huh… How nice… I wanna wear one too… I mean, just kiddin’.”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “I told you to be quiet. Don’t make me keep repeating that. Are those ears decoration? You are making it more obvious with each word you speak how empty the inside of your head is.</p><p>Just looking at you irritates me, failure.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Don’t be so angry, Oshi-san. Ah, want a candy? Sweet stuff’s just perfect for when you’re annoyed.</p><p>I thought I’d give it to you, Oshi-san! I got a strawberry flavored one.</p><p>Huh? It‘s not here… Did I drop it somewhere? Hmm…?”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “Enough. It tires me to deal with you.</p><p>That said, I’ll leave an explanation for you, at least. I am analyzing the costume the young girl over there is said to have made.</p><p>It appears she wanted me to advise her, as the president of the handicrafts club.</p><p>Apparently, she used to go to Kiryuu for everything, but cute and girlish outfits aren’t his specialty, so she should ask me…</p><p>Or at least, he apparently said that to her.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Yer great at makin’ cute costumes, after all, Oshi-san!”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “Hmph, and thanks to whom did I became good at this? That said, while I thoroughly pick faults at this girl’s work…</p><p>I must admit her crafts impress me, somewhat.</p><p>Kiryuu taught her the ABC’s in sewing, apparently. The costumes she made are strongly flavored with Kiryuu’s influence.</p><p>And that also means his mother’s… It made me recall the sweet past, and I ended up staring.</p><p>How unlike me to be sentimental. The woman I loved is no longer in this world.</p><p>Rather than that – Kagehira. I heard you talking about a job?”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Ah, yeah! There’s gonna be a Live in the auditorium soon! We Valkyrie are gonna go on stage too!</p><p>So please hurry and prepare, Oshi-san.”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “What in the world have you done… I am not at top condition. I can’t even release half of my true strength.</p><p>To stand on stage like this would be a shame that lasts eternity. Valkyrie’s Lives must always be perfect.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “But, Oshi-san… If we don’t show results soon, Valkyrie’ll be wiped out.</p><p>And then, where can I go?</p><p>Oshi-san, I’m ‘ere because you picked me up. I’m kinda like an emptyheaded scarecrow…</p><p>The only thin’ I can do is to stand still.</p><p>But it’s only by your side I can stay, Oshi-san.”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “Kagehira. I understand that you’re doing many things for Valkyrie’s sake.</p><p>Yes, because I know everything… Everything is on top of my palm.</p><p>However, that too was in the past. Valkyrie had lost, and everything ended.</p><p>Like how Nordic gods were chased away in the name of Christianity.</p><p>Having lost, I was looked down upon, buried in the bottom of the mud… But there is no need for you to get mixed up in that.</p><p>You may change your name and form, and live in a brand a new land… just like Nito.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “If it’s with you, I’m perfectly okay with a life of sinkin’ deeper into a bottomless pit of mud.</p><p>I’m also part o’ Valkyrie… Even if the myth and the world were to end, I’ll be Valkyrie forever.”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “A silly question maybe, but I wonder why you’re so fond of me. I don’t believe I’ve ever treated you kindly.</p><p>And I’ve always put you through lots of hardships.</p><p>Imprinting? You’ve simply been deluded into thinking the first object you saw as your parent.</p><p><em>I</em> am the scarecrow here – and you are the odd… lonely crow that has somehow gotten attached to it.</p><p>I wish you would use me as a mere perch and fly freely. Though I guess it’s too late for that, and it’s useless to say all this to an idiot.</p><p>I will follow you there when I feel like it, so you may go ahead.</p><p>A life of losing isn’t suitable for me… I already saw something nice today, so I’m feeling good.</p><p>Valkyrie’s costumes are always ready for use. You may take it and go, Kagehira.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “O-Okay. Oshi-san, you’ll really stand on stage?”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “If I feel like it. Hurry and go; you’re an eyesore.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Okay! I’ll be waitin’ for ya, Oshi-san! Then ‘scuse me!”</p><p><em>(Mika leaves)</em></p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “…Sheesh. Ridiculous, is it not, young girl? That one is still convinced I am the strongest and perfect top idol.</p><p>He still believes that I, who can no longer even dance as well as I want, am the Sovereign of Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>God has forgotten to insert a brain on that thing, you see.</p><p>That said, even if it’s just one, for as long as there’s someone who sees a dream in me…</p><p>I’m still an idol. There is worth for me to stand on stage, even if I would only be sneered and thrown stones at.</p><p>You may at least watch over us. That’s your job, isn’t it, Producer?</p><p>After an idol fell and lost everything, what sort of end would they reach? You won’t lose anything from burning the image to your retina.”</p><hr><h2 id="itsuki-shuu">Itsuki Shuu</h2><h3 id="puppet-sovereign">Puppet Sovereign</h3><p><strong>Unlock requirement:</strong> Itsuki Shuu’s Intimacy Level 3</p><p><strong>&gt; Auditorium</strong></p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/3VBMSVF.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Ello! A super day today, gentlemen! We bunch are the Valkyrie!</p><p>Gotta give ya my thanks for choosin’ us as your opponent in today’s DreamFes!</p><p>By ourselves, we wouldn’t be able to rent the Auditorium – or even perform in a Live! We were troubled, I tell you!</p><p>To gather the audience and split the necessary expense in half – we’re in your debt! You got my greatest gratitude, sirs!</p><p>Please go easy on us today!</p><p>Aah, but you’re all certainly a lovely bunch, aren’tcha! I love cute things, y’see!</p><p>Uh, if I’m not mistaken, y’all should be Ra*bits…</p><p>Uwaah, you’re Ra*bits!?</p><p>Which means… Uwaah, Nazuna-nii!?”</p><p><strong>Nazuna:</strong> “Yeah. I don’t really want to say anything bad, but I think you’re better off quiet… What’s with that just then, really? You’re not a comedian.</p><p>Isn’t Valkyrie supposed to be a unit of prestige beauty that doesn’t mingle with the masses?”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “U-Uuuh…? Y-Yeah, but I’m scared of people I dunno!</p><p>I thought I’d trick it by runnin’ my mouth one-sidedly! I thought I need to be courteous at least, so I even practiced greetings and stuffs!”</p><p><strong>Nazuna:</strong> “Well, it was nice and energetic and all, but I think he’ll get angry at you, that Itsuki.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “D-Don’t talk t’ me so casually! Traitor! Don’t think I’ve forgiven ya, Nazuna-nii! S-So unpleasant!”</p><p><strong>Nazuna:</strong> “…I see. Sorry for being so casual with you.</p><p>I shouldn’t forget my manners just because we’re old friends. We’ll be giving our best, so let’s have a fair match.</p><p>We’re in your care today, Kagehira… no, Valkyrie.</p><p>We’re a unit full of newbies, so we’re honored to have a match with our senior and will do our best to match up.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Hngh… H-He’s totally speaking like we’re strangers! That’s so lonely! No, don’t! Nazuna-nii betrayed us! He’s enemy!</p><p>You ain’t foolin’ me with your cuteness!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Umm… Nii-chan seems friendly with our opponent today, isn’t he? Could he perhaps be a friend of his?”</p><p><strong>Mitsuru:</strong> “Hmm? I wonder? You know anything, Tomo-chin?”</p><p><strong>Tomoya:</strong> “Don’t just throw whatever you don’t know at me, Mitsuru.</p><p>But wait, you <em>really</em> have no idea? About our opponent today, Valkyrie…</p><p>If we’re talking about Yumenosaki idols, I thought they should count as a famous one…”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ah, I remember now. I saw them on TV once.</p><p>They were highly praised, said to perform beyond what students should be capable of.</p><p>I didn’t hear anything about them by the time we enrolled… So I thought they’re not active anymore.</p><p>If I’m not mistaken, it should be the unit Nii-chan used to be in.</p><p>That’s why Nii-chan knows our opponent person…</p><p>Hyaah!?”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “Hmm, hmm? Très bien! This is an outstanding talent you’ve found, Nito!</p><p>Still raw maybe, but quite the work of art indeed!”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Eek, uuh!? W-W-W-What’s with this person!? Y-Your face is too close! Are you a pervert!?”</p><p><strong>Mitsuru:</strong> “Hey, don’t scare Hajime-chin! I’ll take it if it’s a fight you’re picking!”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “Fight? Ridiculous! How foolish to go out of your way and scar something beautiful! A sacrilege towards art! Do you mean to insult me!?”</p><p><strong>Mitsuru:</strong> “U-Uh…? I don’t get you! Speak in simpler words!”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “Hmm, hmm… You are an adorable one, yourself. Your conduct is wild, and yet it does not make you seem vulgar the slightest! That’s the miracle from God!</p><p>Those shorts are wonderful on you! You shine the brightest when you move – the very concept of functional beauty!”</p><p><strong>Mitsuru:</strong> “Uhii!? Don’t touch me all over like that! It’s gross! Even Arashi-chan-senpai is less touchy than you…!”</p><p><strong>Tomoya:</strong> “Eeek!? It’s Valkyrie’s leader, Itsuki Shuu!”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “Calling me without honorifics? Know your status. You are… hmm, normal, huh?”</p><p><strong>Tomoya:</strong> “Don’t call me normal!! N-Nii-chan! The enemy boss came!”</p><p><strong>Nazuna:</strong> “…Itsuki, don’t bully my kids.”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “You offend me. I was admiring them.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Oshi-san~”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “Don’t come clinging to me, failure. I was watching from behind the stage – what’s with your attitude back there?</p><p>I’m speechless. What were you doing, bowing your head to a puny unit?</p><p>Never concede, never mingle, and never look back! That is Valkyrie… A doll that makes needless movements will be deemed defective and thrown away, you know?”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “S-Sorry, Oshi-san? I won’t speak a single word from now!”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “I didn’t tell you not to speak. I’m saying you shouldn’t say things without point. Aah, it’s tiring to instruct you on every little thing.</p><p>Nito was quite smart in that aspect, which made it easy for me.</p><p>In the end, you truly are the best masterpiece I’ve perfected and poured my heart and soul to, Nito.</p><p>Do you truly have no intent to come back to Valkyrie, Nito? You may even take these kids home with you as souvenirs, if you want.</p><p>As expected of you, Nito. You’re well informed with my tastes… Yes, you are filled with my soul. My tastes and everything have been passed onto you.</p><p>Standing on stage today, I realized:</p><p>Aah, thank goodness. Nito is still mine. Attached to my manipulative strings, you are simply gallantly pretending to be human.</p><p>That’s the sort of hilarious puppet show this is about, right? You are speaking only thanks to my ventriloquism.”</p><p><strong>Nazuna:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “Just like what I’ve done to you… You are lovingly raising these children to be dolls that would amuse you, according to your convenience.</p><p>We’re the same, you and me.”</p><p><strong>Nazuna:</strong> “That’s not it; I’ll show you. Even if it’s still difficult for now, even if I’ll have to lose many times and shed tears in regret…</p><p>I’ll laugh like a human, and show how wrong that arrogance of yours is.”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “That’s impossible. Why, because for as long as you loathe me, you are still on top of my palm. You’re not free; you’re still being manipulated by me…</p><p>Your heart is forever my prisoner.</p><p>That said, having a chat atop the stage like this is just futile. Not beautiful. …Kagehira, surely you’ve taken your lessons?”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “Y-Yeah. You haven’t been doing my maintenance, Oshi-san, so I’m probably rusty…</p><p>But with you pulling my strings, Oshi-san, I can be the strongest!</p><p>No, Valkyrie will be the strongest! We’ll make the whole Yumenosaki recall that!”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “Perfect. Work hard to make up for the good-for-nothing you are. Let’s punish Nito… punish the doll who has left a scar on his master’s fingers.</p><p>Let us stuff him with new cottons, and fix the tear.”</p><p><strong>Mika:</strong> “But I’m glad! For real, Oshi-san, you haven’t been enthusiastic lately… I thought you’d pass on today’s DreamFes too.”</p><p><strong>Shuu:</strong> “Fool, never again shall you move on your own, Kagehira. You accepted the Live match request from Ra*bits as Valkyrie, didn’t you?</p><p>The match is already standing. Running away here would mean loss by default. It would be too difficult for a failure like you to go against four people.</p><p>I have no choice but to stand here as well, reluctant as I may be.</p><p>The matter would’ve been simple if it had been Valkyrie’s solo Live, but I can’t retreat when it’s a match against another unit.</p><p>I can pardon a failure, but I’ll never accept a defeat.</p><p>I can’t let anymore scratches on Valkyrie’s record.</p><p>Just by losing to ‘fine’, a crack ran through my world that I had perfectly tuned.</p><p>I can’t stand any more than this. Even more so if my opponent is you, Nito. It won’t be funny to face defeat at the hands of my own creation.</p><p>…Truth to be told, I’m not yet at perfect condition.</p><p>But I’m well enough to break up naughty children. Nito, adorable Nito… poor Nito.</p><p>You must be thinking to take a step forward by defeating Valkyrie, your old haunts.</p><p>Non! Unacceptable! That is impossible! Why, because I have not allowed that!</p><p>Dolls can only move following the instructions of its puppeteer, you know?</p><p>Let me make you recall that! My cute Pinocchio!</p><p>I am the Sovereign of Yumenosaki Academy! I am the god of this world, the creator of all, and everything moves according to my strings!</p><p>You are fools, so it appears you have forgotten!</p><p>Let us open again the puppet show that had been halted – magnificently! Here will unfold a perfect Live the uneducated masses have never laid their eyes on! Kakakaka…!”</p>]]></content>

Today for sure I’ll take one point from you!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You can lay off with the bragging. Come at me quick.”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “Ossu! I’m thankful for the chance, sir! Today I’ll go with the strategy I’ve been thinking up for quite a while! Fufufu~</p><p>I’d love to see the surprised look on your face, Boss! Eat this – my finishing move…!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “It’s okay to shout, since it put more strength on your fist. But use your limbs more than your mouth, you simpleton!”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “Oggu!? On the solar plexus… (<em>cough</em>, <em>cough</em>)!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I’m not sure what sort of finishing move you’ve thought of, but the key to victory is to not let your opponent do anything.</p><p>Don’t look at yourself; look at your opponent well, and do what he wouldn’t like.</p><p>You okay, Tetsu? I might’ve put too much strength in the punch.”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “(<em>cough</em>, <em>cough</em>) I’m okay! Ugh… One more time, please!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Sure. Still, clashing continuously would make me tired too. Let’s take a short break and…</p><p>Hmm?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “That’s as far as you go!</p><p>You must be this Academy’s strongest, Kiryuu Kurou! I can’t have you feel satisfied just by taking down small fries!</p><p>Next <em>I</em> shall be your opponent! Yaccho~☆”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Ouch ouch ouch – <em>stop!</em> Don’t grab me hard on the face like that! I give I give I give!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “…What’s with you, came to challenge our dojo or somethin’? I’ll take the fight you’re picking, bastard.”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “T-T-That’s not it! Seeing the two of you have a heart-to-heart through clashing your fists tickled my boyish spirit, I just couldn’t resist!</p><p>Please let me off! I’m against violence!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Hmm. The transfer student little miss. Is this idiot with you?</p><p>Do you have some business with me?</p><p>I don’t really get it, but I can’t refuse you, lil’ miss.</p><p>Oi, Tetsu. Prepare tea for our guests. How long are you planning to lay around like that? Stand up. You’re a man, aren’t you?”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “O-Ossu! But the only tea we have is the one in the flask; it’ll be an indirect kiss!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “What are you, a maiden? Then go buy some.”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “Ossu! Anything for you, Boss! I’m off then~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “We’re in no hurry, just be careful… Anyway, if you need something from me, just say it, miss.”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Ah, Transfer student-san was only showing me to you! It’s me who have something to ask from you!</p><p>You see~ I’m in this unit called 2wink with my younger twin brother…</p><p>Lately, that brother, Yuuta-kun, has been complaining about our outfit, see~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “2wink, huh. Come to think of it, I did make the outfit for that. So you didn’t like it. Which part bothers you?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Hee~ I did hear from Transfer student-san, but you’re <em>really</em> the one making costumes and stuffs, Kiryuu-senpai?</p><p>Ahaha! I guess you can’t judge books by their covers~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I’m sewing as hobby – is that bad? What, you have any complaint?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Spare me, I have not! No I mean, <em>I</em> like it, see, that outfit.</p><p>But Yuuta-kun seems to be thinking something along the lines of, ‘I hate how we’re wearing similar outfits just because we’re twins! I need my own individuality!’, you know?</p><p>But since that outfit looks great on Yuuta-kun…</p><p>If someone’s going to be different and change their outfit or hairdo, I think it should be me.</p><p>If we twins wear different outfits, I’m sure Yuuta-kun will feel satisfied too~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Isn’t being twins your selling point in 2wink? You guys look best in symmetry.</p><p>That said, I can’t insist when the person in question doesn’t like it. Then why don’t you try on a few outfits as test?</p><p>I have almost all the other units’ idol outfits and stuffs. I’ll go get them, so take off your clothes while you wait.</p><p>Oi, lil’ miss. Look the other way. There’s nothing interesting looking at some guy change, right?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Ooh, I’m grateful for your enthusiasm in this! You like dressing people up, huh?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You won’t get clothes until you wear them, after all. Look. Judging by your stature, this should fit you well, shouldn’t it?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Ooh, Ra*bits! It’s so cute~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You’re in the Light Music Club, right? Then you might get used to this one too.”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Hyaho, UNDEAD! I’ve dreamed to wear this! Makes me feel a little baddish~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “We’ve got others. You should tell me if there’s any you like best.</p><p>I’ll decide on the direction based on that and make you a new outfit.”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Waai, 'fine’!</p><p>Akatsuki!</p><p>Trickstar!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Wanna try changing hairstyle too? I’ll give you a little make-up if you want. I have some accessories too. It’s gotten pretty fun…~”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Uwah, your eyes totally look serious! You’re plainly more into this than the karate practice just then, aren’t you, Kiryuu-senpai!?</p><p>Well, do whatever you want~ And take it easy. I don’t really need it immediately, anyway.</p><p>But someday. There might come a day where Yuuta-kun and I will walk different paths. This is like rehearsal for that.</p><p>You can make me your dress up mannequin l as you like~ Though… I’ll be happiest if he and I can walk on the same path.</p><p>Ahaha. Somehow I’m feeling a bit lonely, the tears just come out…~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Hey, you – are you interested in crossdressing?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “I don’t have any plan on walking <em>that</em> path!</p><p>Ahaha – but now the loneliness has just flew somewhere!</p><p>It’s gotten fun for me too~ Thanks, Kiryuu-senpai!

Nagumo Tetora is making his return!</p><p>I’ve rushed and bought drinks as you ordered, Boss!</p><p>And while at it, I borrowed the kitchen in the garden terrace and made some light meal too! It’s almost time for meal, after all.</p><p>I’m such a thoughtful man!<nice guy>~</nice></p><p>…Err no, or maybe this kind of thoughtful gesture is actually too feminine? I wonder.</p><p>I’ll ask Boss about it later! Boss always teaches me about manly virtues, after all~</p><p>Usually Boss wouldn’t eat more than one or two bite even when I make him something. It’s not like eating will kill him, though.</p><p>But now we have guests in the dojo, after all! I’ve got this feeling he’ll enthusiastically wolf them down, thinking it’ll be rude if he’s the only one not eating!</p><p>I’m looking forward to that~ (<em>humming</em>)</p><p>But our guests… I wonder what they need in the dojo? I went out before they spoke in details, so I don’t know, huh~</p><p>Transfer student-san, and the older of the twin… Hinata-kun, are our guests, huh. What a curious combination~</p><p>I wonder what those two could need from our dojo? What a mistery~</p><p>Well, whatever! What I don’t know I can just ask the Boss!)</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “…Huh? Ooi, Hinata-kun! Why are you outside the dojo. Is your business done?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Eh? Ah, no. I’m Yuuta, though…?”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “Ah, the younger one, huh. Pretty confusing~ What are you doing? The older one came to our dojo just then, you know?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “I know. Actually, stop calling us like 'the older one’ and 'the younger one’, can you? It’s not like we’re being marketed like two as a set.”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “Ah… then I’m sorry about that. Anyway, what are you doing standing around like that? It makes you look suspicious. You’re loosely shady, you know?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Eh, no… Don’t mind me. I only passed by. Bye-bye. Keep it a secret from Aniki that I was here, okay?”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “Hmm~? But hey, you’re already all the way here. If you’re free, Yuuta-kun, I want you to rest at our dojo!</p><p>I made too much food, so I’d be happy if you’d eat together with us~”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Eh, no, I’m not free!</p><p>Uwaah, don’t pull my hand!”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “Chow, chow~ Chow down and chow~ (<em>humming</em>)”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “L-Listen to what people say! You’re all the same~!”</p><p>&gt; Dojo</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “Boss! I’ve come back!”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “You’re too late, Tetsu. I did say we’re in no hurry, but you’ve kept the guests waiting.</p><p>Well, thanks for the hard work anyway. Sorry to rush you, but give us the drinks quick. The water in the flask are all empty; my throat’s all dry.”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “Ossu! Which one’s good? I bought a lot! Boss, you don’t really like sweet stuff, right? Then have this black coffee please~</p><p>By the way, in Ryuuseitai, I’m Ryuusei Black~”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I know. Don’t make a fuss over every little thing; it makes you look cheap.</p><p>…Hmm?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Tetora:</strong> “Ah, I forgot! It’s the younger of the twin, Yuuta-kun. He was loitering outside the dojo, so I brought him along with me!</p><p>Should I haven’t?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Hmm, if you ask that, I guess you shouldn’t have. But well, this is just how stuffs turned out.</p><p>Hey, the younger one of the twin… Yuuta, was it? Well, you sit over there. In a little while you’ll be able to see something nice…”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “H-Huuh…?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Tada~☆</p><p>Sorry to keep you waiting everyone, my name is Aoi Hinata! I’ve made my gallant entrance, clad in the outfit of our Academy’s prided unit of traditional arts, Akatsuki!”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “W-W-W-Wha…? What are you doing, you idiot Aniki!?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Uwaa, Yuuta-kun! Why are you here!? You’re wrong, I’m not being unfaithful to you!”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Aniki! I scolded you a little then you sulked, going ’<em>Huhu, you hate me now, don’t you, darling!?’</em> and ran off somewhere…</p><p>So I was wondering where and what you were doing, and I got <em>this…</em>!? W-Why are you wearing the Akatsuki outfit?</p><p>Aaah, I see, is that how is it, sir?! You’re backing down from 2wink and entering Akatsuki? Sure, like I care! You’re just hindering 2wink’s activity anyway!”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Y-You’re wrong~… Yuuta-kun, you didn’t seem to like wearing the same outfit as me, so…</p><p>I’m asking Kiryuu-senpai and Transfer student-san to make me a new outfit!”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Aah, I think we did have that kind of talk…? But why are you asking Kiryuu-senpai to make the outfit?”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “Well, most of the unit outfits are my work. Sewing is my hobby, see…</p><p>So how was it? You tried on a lot, but was there any outfit you like?”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Hmm~ I think I’m most accustomed to the 2wink one, after all. But Yuuta-kun, you hate wearing the same outfit as me, right?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Aniki, you idiot!”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Oof!? To think you’d come at me with a drop kick without leaving room to argue!</p><p>You sure have packed more punch, Yuuta-kun! No wait, in this case, it should be 'packed more kick’ huh, fufufu…☆”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Why do you look so happy about it…</p><p>Hey, Aniki? It’s true I hate having everything and anything 'the same as Aniki’, but being 'twins’ is our strength, isn’t it?</p><p>That’s what you always say, isn’t it, Aniki? I’m frustrated by it, but I agree. It’s our unique trait, our merit, our weapon – so what are you trying to gain by throwing that away?’</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> &quot;Yu-Yuuta-kun…?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “You don’t have to go out of your way to change your appearance. I can outsail the idiot Aniki anytime!</p><p>I’m sure our difference will come through, someday for sure! But it’s still too difficult for that right now.</p><p>I’m just really frustrated and vexed by that fact, that I’m angry at myself! Understand at least that much. You’ve been by my side since we were born!”</p><p><strong>Hinata:</strong> “Yuuta-kun…</p><p>I see… of course. Ahaha! I’ve been a little worried because you’re showing rebellious tendencies lately, Yuuta-kun! L-Like, maybe you hate me~ or something.”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Geez, I don’t hate you, Aniki. We’re family, right? You can be really annoying sometimes though. But even that’s not to the point I’d break off relations with you, you know?</p><p>Well, that’s how it is. I’m sorry my idiot Aniki has been troubling you. We’re still going to go as 2wink… as twins for a little longer.”</p><p><strong>Kurou:</strong> “I see. Well, everything’s good if you family get along. If you guys have any trouble just lightly consult me.</p><p>'A design that makes best use of the fact we’re twins, while still stressing the difference, where we enhance each other’ kind of thing seems pretty fun too, eh?</p><p>Actually, I really wanted to sew, y’know. Now that my creative urge got worked up for nothing, what do I gotta do with it?</p><p>…Oi, the transfer student lil’ miss. What have you been up to in that corner since a while ago?</p><p>Aah, the older twin was changing so you were trying to not look, huh? I guess girls would worry about that stuff.</p><p>My little sister’s the same. Sorry for not noticing. As apology, I’ll tailor an outfit for your use, lil’ miss.</p><p>I’ll dress you up into all kinds of outfits. I’ve been wanting to design for women as a change of pace.</p><p>It seems 2wink doesn’t need any new outfit yet, after all~”</p><hr><h2 id="aoi-yuuta">Aoi Yuuta</h2><h3 id="older-brother-and-younger-brother">Older brother and Younger brother</h3><p>&gt; Light Music Club Room</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Ooi, Aniki~?</p><p>…He’s not in the Light Music Club room either, huh.</p><p>Geez, where could he have gone, that idiot Aniki? He <em>annoyingly</em> gets in my hair when I don’t need him around me, yet when I <em>do</em> need him he’s nowhere!</p><p>Ah, 'scuse me, Transfer student-senpai. What are you doing here? Are you lost?</p><p>Hmm. So, for your producer work to go smoother…</p><p>…You got a master key that can enter any room in this Academy from Sagami-sensei, is it?</p><p>During that recent ruckus… DDD, you did play a pretty active role. So it’s like you’ve gotten more authority, huh? That’s commendable. I respect you~</p><p>That means you’ve gained trust from the teachers, right?</p><p>Nah, though Sagami-sensei is pretty loose on that area, so the chance that he’s just not thinking of anything is high too.</p><p>But next time, if I want to sneak into some place, I’ll rely on you, Senpai. No, see, Aniki does pranks often so there are times we need to hide from the student council.</p><p>It’ll help a lot if you can open the lock of some random room and shelter us there, Senpai~</p><p>No, I mean… yeah. It’ll be easy if I can make Aniki stop his pranks, but I won’t exhaust myself like this if he listens to what I say. That stupid Aniki is always, always like that…!</p><p>Right, right – have you seen Aniki somewhere? I’m looking for him.</p><p>Well, usually I’m the one who goes around avoiding and running away from Aniki. But I have to meet him right now.</p><p>There’s a job for our unit… 2wink. I want to consult Aniki about it.</p><p>For once, Aniki is 2wink’s leader, after all. For us to accept or reject a job, I need Aniki’s approval and signature.</p><p>Aniki is pretty bad with that sort of annoying procedure.</p><p>If that’s the case, then I could’ve just been leader, but it was like, 'I’m the older brother, so I’m the more amazing one!’ and now look…</p><p>I’m sorry. I ended up complaining!</p><p>Maybe I should just sign in place of Aniki? Our handwriting are pretty much the same anyway; I’m sure amateur can’t tell them apart~</p><p>Pantomime… This job is just trying to sell us as twins more.</p><p>Aniki would probably be happy, but maybe I should just reject this on my own? I don’t want to keep being marketed as a set with Aniki.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Kukuku, you’re at an age full of worries, are you not, Yuuta-kun~”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Uwooh, so you were there, Prez!? Why are you inside that locker?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Yes. I was sleepy, see, so I mistook this for the coffin I usually used as bed and got in here instead.</p><p>I was troubled because I cannot get out. So I pleaded for help to the young lady, who just happened to pass by.”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Aah, I understand why Transfer student-senpai is in this club room now.</p><p>Don’t fall into a pinch over such stupid reason, please. You’re not yet at the age to go senile, are you?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “I’m terribly sorry about that… Since I seem to have lost face anyway, would you care to pull me out?</p><p>If I stay like this, I might be trapped in this locker forever and turn into a mummy.”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Isn’t it too out there for a vampire to become a mummy? Geez.</p><p>…Then I’m pulling you out now. There~”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Phew. You have saved me.</p><p>The transfer student young lady by herself would be too powerless to do anything, but I wanted to refrain from showing my shameful side to those outside my circle, yes?</p><p>Still – I have overheard your talk a little, and I’m quite interested. It appears the position of a 'younger brother’ is also one full of worries.</p><p>However, I would like you to understand the hardships of the 'older brother’ too~”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Aah… Come to think of it, you have a little brother in Yumenosaki too, don’t you, Prez.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Yes. Coincidentally, it appears the transfer student young lady has a younger brother of her own. He seems to go to this Yumenosaki Academy’s normal course.</p><p>I would love to catch glimpse of him at least once~”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Hmm. So you’re an 'Onee-chan’, huh, Transfer student-senpai. Maybe I should call you 'Onee-chan’ too…~</p><p>Then I’ll represent the 'younger brothers’ and say this. Don’t play around with us too much.</p><p>We’re not accessories or servants for you 'older brothers’ and 'younger sisters’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>, you know?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “That certainly strikes home, yes. Then allow me to say this to you as an 'older brother’ too.</p><p>We think of 'younger brother’ as a part of our body, that’s just born a little later than us. An important, important part of our flesh as well as our heart.</p><p>And so they would not be hurt, so they would not taste the same failure as we did - as someone who has walked a little further than them, we cannot help but fuss over them.</p><p>In case of brothers, especially. Manly pride and the sort tend to get in the way. We cannot help but want to look cool.</p><p>We want to show off to our 'younger brother’ for being able to do what they can’t.</p><p>We want to be told 'Awesome!’ so we can act the older brother and say 'I’ll teach you how it’s done’.</p><p>The Aoi big brother… Hinata-kun. Is that not how he is, as well?</p><p>He has been rather eager in practicing lately. Until just now, it seems he has been doing lessons with the transfer student young lady.</p><p>He was saying, 'Yuuta-kun is growing in great speed, so I can’t lose too!’, seemingly quite into it, you know?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “…”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “How about you accept that Pantomime job? You see, we older brothers are always happy to do something together with our younger brother.</p><p>We’d even push ourselves to the limit in order to show off to our younger brother, you see?</p><p>And as your older brother do that, you should chase after his back, and just sometimes, tell him 'Awesome!’ – praising him.</p><p>In your case, unlike with me, the two of you are still walking the same path. Do you not think averting your eyes is quite lonely?”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “…That’s true. Even if someday we’ll walk different paths… That’s not yet the case now.</p><p>Thank you very much, Prez. I’ve come to understand an 'older brother’s feelings a little.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Thank me not; us old men simply love preaching people, see. In short, what I wanted to say is, brothers are best getting along well.”</p><p><strong>Yuuta:</strong> “Yes!</p><p>Transfer student-senpai, please take me to the place Aniki is practicing.</p><p>I’m going to practice together with him. At least so I wouldn’t be left behind too much. Stuffs relating to what we’ll do from then on to the future, I’ll think only after I catch up with Aniki.”</p><p>*Other notes. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Uhh I don’t know how to translate it, but Tetora is just singing some made up song about eating. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p></li><li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>It says younger sister, but I wonder if it’s not a typo of older sister…?

In the first place, my entering the Light Music Club was because that annoying vampire bastard and I were in the same unit and… Tch. Just remembering it pisses me off!</p><p>(<em>Door</em>)</p><p>Hey! Oogami Kouga-sama has arrived! Come give me a grand welcome!</p><p>…Tch. What the heck? Nobody’s here? The twins aside, what’s up with even the club head not being present!? Are they even <em>trying</em> to do club activities, haah? Leader authority or whatever, leaving a coffin in here is just takin’ up space! Actually, bringing a coffin to a Light Music Club room – is he an idiot or somethin’!? (<em>kicks</em>) Why don’t you try to be more like a Light Music Club leader!? Bring a musical instrument, damnit! (<em>kicks</em>)</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Don’t kick it around… It’s resounding in my head.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Wha! So you were here! Don’t sleep in the coffin – you’re shocking people!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Even if you tell me not to, this is my resting place… Anyway, Doggie. I believe I should’ve told you to wake me up only once the sun is down?</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Like I care, bastard.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Now, don’t be so sharp. You’re always so hotblooded, I don’t know how to deal with you. Come on, Doggie. I’ll roll a ball for you.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Nrrrghh don’t make fun of me! I’m a wolf! Don’t treat me like some stray dog on the street!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> …Yet he’s responding to the ball. Well, Doggie is a dishonest one, so he thinks he can only get people’s attention by acting defiant. Hmm… It’s odd how his aggravating attitude starts to look endearing once you think of it like that.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Aarrgh! THAT. ATTITUDE. IS WHAT. I HATE. ABOUT. YOU!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Don’t yell into my ears, Doggie. Ah, sheesh. You should know as well I’m not at my best in this time of the day, Doggie. I’m a descendant of darkness. While it may not be daylight, I still can’t use even half of my true strength during golden hour. There’s some time left until the sun is completely down, so I’ll be taking a little nap. <em>yawn</em></p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Bastard…! ( – No, wait! Now that the vampire bastard is weakened, I should be able to teach him a lesson! That’s right! I can’t let this ideal chance slip by!)</p><p>Showing a weakness in front of me has been your falling, vampire bastard! If you’re <em>so</em> sleepy, let me put you into eternal sleep! Orraa – ! …!?</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Contrary to your looks, you certainly are easily lonely, Doggie. I have lived for an infinitely long time, so it is not that I do not comprehend that loneliness. But to get so enraged after having been left alone for a few hours? You’re more than just a little easily lonely.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Why did you dodge!? Anyway, I picked fight because I was lonely? What am I, an idiot!? You callin’ me a dumb kid!?</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Oh. So you do possess some self-awareness! Hmm. So this is how lonely it feels to watch your children grow. They say the stupider the child the more adorable, but it seems that truly is the case.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Nrrgaah! Don’t affirm it! Don’t make fool of me, son of a bitch!!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Now, Doggie. Don’t make a fuss so; you’ll damage the instruments. Come now, what would happen if you leave a scar on that electric guitar you treasure so much? You even said you’d trade your life to protect it; watching you break your own vow would be much too embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> …Kh! Gggrh…</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Yes, yes. That’s nice. You can really do it if you try. Now keep clenching your fist like that, turn 180 degree around, walk out of the room and go straight home. I shall sleep until night and thus, all is well.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Thus, all is well… YEAH RIGHT! Anyway, it seems like you’re trying to make me leave but I won’t let you! You see, <em>I’m</em> a proud wolf! As if I’ll pull back after being made fool of like that!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> How troublesome… I’m truly sleepy, though… (<em>yawn</em>)</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> That’s why I’m telling you I’ll put you to eternal sleep!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Your way of putting people to sleep is too brutal, Doggie… If the Aoi brothers are here I can make them sing me a lullaby, but… Doggie. Why don’t you sing me a song that’d make me sleepy? Ah. But don’t sing while playing the electric guitar, please. That won’t be lullaby, but a sone.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Then as you wish, I’ll play the guitar for you!! …!? Bastard, give me back my guitar! I’d have to sterilize it later having a vampire bastard like you touch it!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Are you taking me for some kind of pathogen? To go so far to disturb my sleep, you get lonely truly easily, Doggie. Come now, here’s a candy for you. Here, here, take it! Or maybe you’d prefer a chocolate? Ah, no no! Giving chocolates to dogs is dangerous since they can cause poisoning, huh…</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Candies, chocolates – I’m not a brat!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Yes, I understand; be at peace. Doggie is Doggie. You’re a proud mister dog!</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Yeah, I’m a proud mister do – WAIT NO! I’m not a dog! I’m a woooooooolf!!!</p><p>-continue!-</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> I’m not a dog! I’m a wooooooolf!!!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> The sooner you admit it, the easier it’ll be for you, Doggie. In the first place, dogs are close relative of wolves. You can give up on the wolf and just become a dog.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> No, the difference between dog and wolf is like Heaven and Earth! Dogs are tamed, domesticated animals. I’m not a domestic animal – I’m an aloof wolf!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> You pride yourself for being an aloof, lone wolf, but I heard you and that pet Akehoshi-kun keeps – what was it… Dai… kyou? Yes – are on good terms.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Not Daikyou (<em>terrible luck</em>), but Daikichi (<em>excellent luck</em>)! Anyway, Daikyou!? What’s with that ominous name!?</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> I think it’s a nice name, though. An excellent name befitting of a descendant of darkness.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Don’t suddenly make Daikichi a descendant of darkness! Look, unlike that Idiot Akehoshi, Daikichi is a capable man! Never running out of patience for his owner, he’s always supporting Akehoshi. As a single man, I really respect Daikichi. If you’re gonna insult Daikichi – I don’t care who you are, I won’t ever forgive you!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> You really love animals, huh, Doggie… Oh, speak of the devil and he shall come. Look, Daikichi is playing near the water fountain. You can join him and play in the water too, Doggie.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> For real!? – Ah, damn… But this isn’t time to play with Daikichiii!!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Now, Doggie. What are you trying to do by lifting the coffin?</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Ain’t it obvious!? I’ll hit you with this… coff… in… ggh… gaaah! What’s with this heaviness!? It’s a coffin, right!? It should just be a few tens of kilos so why is it so heavy!?</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Normal coffins aside, <em>my</em> coffin also functions as a living space.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Haah!?</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Did you think I brought a coffin here just for me to sleep in? This coffin is my house! I’d appreciate if you do not think of me the same as lonely salarymen out there who use their house only to sleep.The fans will rage at an idol with a sloppy daily life. A wholesome private life makes for wholesome working habits. Hence, I gathered many things inside my coffin. Like manga I borrowed from Aoi-kun, or the gardening magazines I gathered as hobby. Naturally there are also clothes, and this is even fully equipped with a refrigerator!</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> You an idiot!? Like so many things can fit in there!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> About that, see – I can trick it with excellent arranging skills! It is quite packed, so when you treat the coffin roughly, Doggie, the stuffs inside jitter about like they’ll fall out. Especially the refrigerator, packed tightly with my most favorite dry-cured ham. There are unsealed packs inside, so if they fall out of the refrigerator it will turn into a huge mess. As much as I favor my dry-cured hams, I would like to avoid eating ones that have fallen and scattered inside the coffin. When it comes to that, Doggie – I’ll have you compensate me.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Ggggghh…</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Come now, Doggie. What are you groaning for? It’s irritating.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> I’m… not… groaning…! Ngh… Kh… Damn… It’s heavy…</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> If it’s heavy you don’t have to force yourself to lift it; just put it down.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> I… don’t take orders from you…! Gggh… What happens if I can’t take on something this heavy!? I won’t have any face to show Daikichi…! Damnit…!!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Ooh! You’re trying so hard! While I am pleased to see you work so hard, Doggie, if this keeps up, the stuffs inside will truly be wasted. Hmm. This is the chance, I suppose. Here, Doggie. It’s a ball; go get it!</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> (<em>reacts</em>) Huh!? – Ah, damn – gaaaaah!! Gggh…</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> I didn’t think you’d take the bait so readily. How delightful, haha!</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Gggh… Damn it… Shit, shit, shit!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Now don’t use such foul language. I wonder where I raised you wrong…</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Stop acting all mighty! Ggggh… Heavy… Uggh…</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> You look like you’re in pain. It’s not my hobby to bully the weak, so… Doggie, why don’t I lend you hand?</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Who would… borrow your help…! And anyway I’m not weak…! I’ll prove that to you right now…!! Gggh… Gaaahh!!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Hmm. I think that coffin way exceeds your body weight, however… Aah, don’t fuss around like a fish out of water.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Tch… Shut the hell up! If I don’t do this much the coffin won’t lift… Gah!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Hitting the coffin with your head… You sure don’t think very far, Doggie. Staying that way must be painful, right? I’ll lend you a hand.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> ! Gh… Ggh… Oi, vampire bastard! If you think I’m indebted to you with this, you’re greatly mistaken!</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> I got it, Doggie. Anyway, until when are you going to stay that way? I want to sleep soon (<em>yawn</em>).</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Damn you bastard…!! Making a huge fool out of me… I won’t ever forgive you!! …Huh! Right, I got it… This is part of your plan, ain’t it!? To deceive me this far, you’re certainly one hell of an opponent, you son of a bitch! But what a pity, vampire! I’m not so weak to get discouraged by this! I’ll prove to you right here right now that such adversities only serve to strengthen me!! Open your eyes wide and look closely!! Ggh… Ghh…</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Deceive…? You simply sown troubles and reaped them yourself, Doggie. But I suppose this unyielding nature is what makes you. I’m really sleepy too because you woke me up at a strange time… Whatever shall we do now?</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Hnnghh… Nggh…</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> And Doggie is busy groaning like a starving dog… Ah, geez… How troublesome…</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Gggh… Until I can outwit you… I’ll never give uuuuuuuup!!</p><h2 id="rei-adonis">Rei &amp; Adonis</h2><p><strong>Rei:</strong> (<em>yawn</em>) I’ve had a good sleep today. The sun has also sunk already… I’ve gathered enough vitality. …Very well then, perhaps I should go see my dearest children now.</p><p>(<em>sound of door</em>)</p><p>Have I kept you waiting, dearest children? You all must have been incredibly lonely without me. Now now, let me console you!</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> …</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Oh? I see no one beside you here, Adonis-kun… is everyone taking a breather outside, perhaps?</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> Oogami said he had to walk his dog and returned home. I haven’t heard anything from Hakaze-senpai.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> My, what shameless children… On that note, I’m touched by what a good child you are, Adonis-kun. Come here. Let me pet you.</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> I am not a small living thing. I’m a huge giant. There is no reason for me to be patted in the head like a small child.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> True enough, we are of mostly similar height, and you are strong, Adonis-kun. However, you are younger than me. Spoiling the youths is the duty of the elderly.</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> This world favors survival of the fittest. Small, weak living things will be crushed by the strong and taste hardships. That’s what I was taught.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Mm. I see you were raised in a rather unique environment, Adonis-kun. Well, I myself have been in a rather peculiar one, so I can’t say anything about others. However, letting others spoil you is also one type of experience. Come. Think of me as your older brother and jump into my chest!</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> I appreciate the consideration, Sakuma-senpai, but I’ll refrain.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> And completely rejected. Well, as brimming with vitality as I am with the sun down, I will without doubt fall were I to take on Adonis-kun. Personally, I would love to embrace Ritsu in these arms, but… Ritsu always runs away whenever he sees me.</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> I’m skilled at capturing preys. If you tell me to, I can go capture the prey right now.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> As alluring an offer that is, Ritsu will only hate me more, so I shall pass.</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> Understood.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Hmm… (Adonis-kun is a good kid, but I’m slightly lost how to treat him… Speaking of, it has been so long since I talked with Adonis-kun like this… Let’s see, what shall we do now?)</p><p>(<em>phone ringing</em>)</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Oh? For some reason I am hearing a rather irritating sound.</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> It is probably my cellphone. I’m sorry, Sakuma-senpai, but can you take it for me?</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> I don’t mind. Let me see… Hmm. It says ‘Sister’ on the screen. Adonis-kun, do you not think it would be better if <em>you</em> take this?</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> No. Hearing that, I can’t pick it up even more.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> It appears you bear a deep problem. Fundamentally, I do not stick my nose into my members’ personal problems, but if we speak of blood related siblings then it’s different. Adonis-kun – would you let me hear your reason?</p><p>-continued!-</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> When I was weak and small, I was worked like a slave by my older sisters. Even now that I’ve become big and established control, I still don’t know how to deal with my sisters.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Hence you refuse to pick up your phone.</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> Yes. They’ve stopped making unreasonable demands, but now they try to take advantage of my built. Fortunately, I’m good at physical work. I can carry luggage no matter how heavy. However, I’m not my sisters’ slave. I can’t attend to their needs at the cost of my private time.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> So you fear that they will ask you to carry their luggage for them if you take this call.</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Adonis-kun. Siblings are a blessing. Your sisters might be hard on you, but they probably do all that with your good in mind. As a child I too racked my brain often for Ritsu.</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> Sakuma-senpai, you’re very doting towards your little brother, huh.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> I do realize I spoil him a little too much. Though unfortunately, not even a micro of my love appears to be conveyed to Ritsu.</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> My sisters also told me that they order me around because they love me.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> Well, if they hate you, they would not even call you. …And actually, the phone is still ringing even now.</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> If I leave it for an hour, I’m sure it’ll stop.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> But surely we cannot leave it as is for that long, yes? I will wait here, so why not take the call?</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> …Understood.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> (Still, I got to see one of Adonis-kun’s unexpected sides. Considering his feelings don’t show on his face, this is certainly rare.)</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> I’m sorry to keep you waiting.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> That is rather fast, actually. In the end, what did she say to you?</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> She told me to pick up faster next time… and hung up.</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> …(<em>bursts into laugh</em>) It seems you really are loved by your sisters, Adonis-kun. Let’s see, perhaps I should give Ritsu a call, myself… Wait for me, Ritsu~</p><h2 id="kaoru-adonis-transfer-student-chan">Kaoru &amp; Adonis +Transfer Student-chan</h2><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> (Finally the boring lessons have ended… Maybe I’ll invite a girl and play or something~ …Mm? That’s…)</p><p>Transfer student-chan, are you going home too right now? Then what about going on a date with me? There’s a pretty good cafe near here… Hey, no need to be so guarded! Hmm? So you have something you have to do immediately. I see. That’s why you were in a hurry. But since I already met you, it’s pretty sad to say goodbye here. Ah, right! If a cafe’s too much, what about the garden terrace? …That’s no good either? Other girls would jump on my invitation even if it means pushing aside their business, though. But I guess that’s where you’re worth it. You know, the harder the tide the more you’d like to challenge it, right?</p><p>[sounds of footsteps]</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> …So it’s Hakaze-senpai and the transfer student. If you stand around chatting at a place like this, you’ll be bothering the passersby.</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Sorry, sorry! You heard Adonis-kun, so let’s go to the garden terrace for a nice cha – huh? Transfer student-chan? Why are you hiding behind Adonis-kun, I wonder?</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> What’s wrong, Transfer student? …I see. You were being bullied by Hakaze-senpai. Hakaze-senpai, <em>I</em> will protect small living things. Even if you’re my senior, I won’t go easy.</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Wait, wait! I’d love if you don’t use dangerous words against me. You too, Transfer student-chan. It’s no good to say misleading things, okay? Adonis-kun isn’t good with jokes.</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> Hmm. So you weren’t being bullied by Hakaze-senpai. But you did run away from Hakaze-senpai. So there must be some kind of reason behind that.</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Uuh… hey, Adonis-kun? I think explaining that will result in a troublesome –</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> I see. So Hakaze-senpai tried to take you to the garden terrace against your will. Hakaze-senpai, <em>I</em> will protect small living things.</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> (Uwaah! He’s glaring daggers at me. I think I’ll just be adding oil to the fire if I say that I was inviting transfer student-chan on a date. I mean, Adonis-kun is completely convinced it’s his duty to protect transfer student-chan. Hmm (<em>clicks tongue</em>) I think I’ve made an enemy out of an annoying opponent…)</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> Transfer student. There’s nothing to worry now that I’m here. Whatever happens, I’ll protect you.</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Hahaha! Adonis-kun, you’re so cool! Gallantly arriving to save a damsel in distress, you’ll put even Knights to shame. But still, I wonder why Transfer student-chan always avoids me? I think I’m really nice to transfer student-chan though~ …Well, not to say I don’t have a clue.</p><p>…Oh, don’t put your guard up against me too, Adonis-kun. We’re members of the same unit; it’s not nice to spark quarrels, right? Look, even transfer student-chan is staring at us watchfully.</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> …Right. It’s just as you said, transfer student. It seems I’ve let blood rush to my head.</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Yeah, yeah! You need to cool down. Anyway, Adonis-kun. Don’t you have something to do? Should you really be chatting with us here now?</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> Hmm. I’ve completely forgotten, but I have business with you, Hakaze-senpai.</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Me?</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> Sakuma-senpai asked me to look for you. He said he’ll be troubled if you won’t <em>finally</em> show up to practice today.</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> Because I haven’t shown up at all lately, eh? I thought he’d let me off one more time, but guess that was too naive.</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> Hakaze-senpai, I’ll have you come with me.</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I’d jump on it without a second’s delay had that been an invitation from a girl, but I just don’t feel like it when it’s a guy, you know? Ah, right, Transfer student-chan! If it’s with you, I won’t mind going to practice. …Haha! You look troubled. You’re serious, transfer student-chan, so you must be worried over ignoring your business, huh?</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> There’s no need for you to be worried, transfer student. This is the task Sakuma-senpai has entrusted me with. In worst case, I’ll bring Hakaze-senpai with me even it means dragging him. So don’t worry.</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> No, no – if you say that, <em>I’m</em> the one who can’t not worry, see? …Can’t be helped. I’ll attend practice even without transfer student-chan this one time.</p><p>…Hmm? Transfer student-chan, you’re making a surprised face. Isn’t this where you should feel relieved?</p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> I’m also surprised. Your dislike for practice is infamous, Hakaze-senpai. So why?</p><p><strong>Kaoru:</strong> I’ll run away if it’s just you here, Adonis-kun, but there’s transfer student-chan too. See – if I show her that I can attend practice seriously too, even transfer student-chan will look at me in a new light, right? So can I take back my invitation this time? When your evaluation of me changed, even just a little, at that time I’ll invite you again. I’ll be happy if you’ll wait until then~</p><h2 id="kouga-touri-transfer-student-chan">Kouga &amp; Touri +Transfer student-chan</h2><p><strong>Touri:</strong> (<em>sigh</em>) She’s not in the classroom either – just where on earth could she have gone to? Since I got my hands on a delicious sweet, I thought I’d share it with Slave #2. …In the first place, she’s just a slave, so isn’t it ridiculous to make me, the master, look for her? The only one who can order around someone as noble as me is the President.</p><p>(…But seriously, where on earth did she go off to? I’ve been walking around the school to look for her… I’m dead tired already. Maybe I should give up on looking. But I want to give Slave #2 these sweets… Argh, what should I do!?)</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Damn… You should seriously learn how to rely on people. Anybody’d get irritated having someone staggering like that right in front of their eyes. Actually, just because someone asked you to, you should know it’s impossible to carry these many at once if you stop to think about it. Are you an idiot?! Work your brain a lil’ bit, will ya, haah!?</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> (Whoa…! That guy over there is… Dog!? Ugh, that made me recall some bad memories. During the special training for the circus, he hit me with a wooden sword so many many MANY times that I got lots of troubles during performance because the swelling won’t go away! Umm… No, I’m not running away from the enemy… I’m making a courageous retreat. Anyway, let’s just go another way… huh?</p><p>The one next to Dog – I mean, Oogami-senpai – is… Slave #2?! Why of all people do you have to be with Oogami-senpai!? D-Don’t tell me… Slave #2… is also being bullied by Oogami-senpai…? Damn you… You think I, Himemiya Touri-sama, would let you slide for bullying <em>my</em> Slave #2!? Wait for me, Slave No.2! Your master will save you now!)</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> Oi, you! What do you think you’re doing, bullying Slave #2 without <em>my</em> consent!? The only one who can bully Slave #2 is myself! Lay off her right now!</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Haah?</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> Hiiiiii!!</p><p>(I-If I fall back here, Slave No.2 would… B-But I’m scared… I mean, I won’t actually do it now but I feel like running away I’m scaaaared!)</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Tch… So it’s the squirt from that time. You have any business with me?</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> I-I-I-I’m no squirt! I have a name and that’s Himemiya Tor–</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Haah?</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> S-s-s-s-s-sorrryyyyy!! I’ll apologize! I’m apologizing so forgive me! I don’t want to be beaten with a wooden sword anymore!!</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Ugh, don’t scream, that’s annoying. I’ll bite you to death.</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> I don’t want to be bitten to death either I’m against violence!! Slave #2…!! …S-Save me.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> ! Y-You! Hiding behind a woman? You can’t even be counted as a man! C’mon, come here!</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> NO no no no no no NOOOOOO!!</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Tch. If my hands aren’t full I can totally crush a squirt like him…! Argh, damnit, don’t run away! If you’re a man, step forward and face me fair and square!</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> !!</p><p>(I hate having Oogami-senpai tell me that… but he’s right. Hiding behind Slave #2 and running away from Oogami-senpai… I’m… totally uncool, huh? Unlike Yuzuru, Slave #2 is kind, but… if this is what I show her, Slave #2 will be disappointed in me!)</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> ! Heh. Aren’t you making a manly face? Fine. Come at me! With how you are right now, I won’t crus–OUCH! Ugh… what!? Don’t suddenly jump at me! I nearly dropped these stuffs on your head, y’know!? …Haah? “No violence”? That ain’t it! This is a showdown between that squirt and I –</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> Slave #2… Daaaaaaaaaah!!</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> !? S-Squirt! Don’t jump at me too! You’re heavy! Get off me!</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> You were trying to protect your master, huh? I’ll praise you! You really are my excellent slave!</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Bastard, are you even listening to what I’m saying!? Look, just get off me, you bastaaards!</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> ! Hold on, you can’t treat my Slave #2 so roughly! Unlike #1, #2 is delicate! You have to treat her with gre~at care.</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Treat her with care? Heh. Brave of you to say after being protected by her.</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> Ugh! I-I only let her take the good role. Rather than that, Slave #2. I’m going to give you something nice, so accept it gratefully. Um, let’s see. It should be around here… eehh err wait, okay? Maybe it was here… Y-You’re lying… It’s not here either… Eh? Why? WHY!? I did put it in my pocket WHY ISN’T IT HERE!?</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Stop shouting, you’re noisy… This is why I hate brats.</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> I’m not a brat! The sweets I thought I’d give Slave #2 isn’t with me, how can I stay calm!? W-What do I do? They’re imported from overseas, so you can’t find it in normal stores… Eh? “We can make the remaining sweets together”? Um… I’m happy to make sweets together with you, Slave #2, but… can we really?</p><p><strong>Kouga:</strong> Tch. That sounds like a pain, so I’ll pass. …Hah? Taste-testing? …Well. I <em>can</em> go along with you if it’s just taste-testing.</p><p><strong>Touri:</strong> I can do without Do- Oogami-senpai, but… it sure sounds fun, making sweets with you! Don’t you agree, Slave #2? You were being nice so I wouldn’t feel down, weren’t you? Thanks. I really really really love you!</p>]]></content>
