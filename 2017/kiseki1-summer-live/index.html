by:</strong> Akira<br><strong>Timeline:</strong> Summer</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2><p><strong>&gt; In front of the station</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/BE1qZKS.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ooi, Anzu-chan♪</p><p>Yahoo~ What a coincidence to meet you here. What are you doing?</p><p>Hmm, so you’re in the middle of work, again…? The student council president requested some things from you, so you’re out to shop? It’s break, though. If you keep at that, you’ll find yourself passing out from exhaustion one of these days.</p><p>Fufu. Because of your big success with Tanabata Festival from a while back, you must’ve garnered much esteem as a producer.</p><p>That’s why they keep requesting you for work, isn’t it?</p><p>Right right, that happens a lot. The happy sort of busyness, isn’t it? Of course everyone wants to give work to the person with capabilities.</p><p>But I see. So you’re in the middle of working for the student council…</p><p>I guess that means you won’t show up for our practice for Summer Live this afternoon?</p><p>I’m sure it’s a good thing that you’re so well-regarded now, Anzu-chan.</p><p>But as a result, you starting to get lots of work unrelated to us Trickstar, too… I feel we’ve become distant, it’s a little lonely.</p><p>Although you never were exclusive to us; you’re everyone’s producer.</p><p>Hmm? What’s with that pose…? Why are you enthusiastically waving around that Trickstar hand fan?</p><p>You make some strange gestures sometimes, Anzu-chan… Is that supposed to be your way of asserting <em>‘Don’t worry, I’m still Trickstar’s fan’</em>?</p><p>Thank you. It’s okay, I wasn’t doubting that. Thanks for always cheering on us, for always supporting us.</p><p>We have faith in you and treasure you all the same, you know… Producer♪</p><p>Fufu. How about I help out with work?</p><p>I’m free until our lesson in the afternoon, so I was just about to wander around the arcades.</p><p>I’m thinking if your work can be finished early, you might get some time to check out our practice.</p><p>I know everyone will be happy if you show up, Anzu-chan.</p><p>Ahaha. Don’t hold back~</p><p>If you’re out shopping, you’ll need someone to carry all the luggage, right? I’ve been working out on my own initiative since Oogami-kun’s drills, so I should be in shape.</p><p>Despite how I look, I’m still a guy, so I’ll be happy to be relied on… Err, though I won’t force you if you don’t want to.</p><p>…Really? I can help? Yay! At your service, then♪”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Hiyori-kuuun? And uh, Sazanami-kun? Is anyone from Reimei Academy here?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hn? Huh, that’s Aoba-senpai from Switch, right…? What is he doing?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Oh? Hello, Anzu-chan, Yuuki-kun~♪”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/3wjWrKg.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hello, Aoba-senpai. Is something wrong? It seems you were looking for someone…”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ah, yes. As part of Trickstar, you should know already, Yuuki-kun. We’re inviting students from another school as guest stars for the Summer Live that will be held the week after the next.</p><p>Today, I’m supposed to pick them up from the station and show them until Yumenosaki…</p><p>…but they haven’t shown up even past the promised time, so I’m at loss.</p><p>Umm, the two of you, have you seen anyone who might be them, somewhere?</p><p>I can’t describe them well, but uh… they should be like, wearing the Reimei Academy uniform!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Reimei Academy… Ah, the newly-established school that’s been the talk recently, huh? It’s been a hot topic throughout the internet that they’re rapidly rising in power.</p><p>I see. So idols from Reimei Academy will be taking part in the Summer Live.</p><p>We Trickstar are taking part in the Summer Live as a representative of Yumenosaki Academy…</p><p>But I still don’t know much since they haven’t told us the details.</p><p>Huh? Wait, I heard we’re the only Yumenosaki idols participating…</p><p>Aoba-senpai, is Switch going to take part as well?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “No, no. I was asked to be the guide because I’m acquainted with the Reimei representative, that’s all.</p><p>He’s hard to please, so we fear he might just go home if we’re not careful.</p><p>…Oh, speak of the Devil. It’s a call from the problem child.</p><p>Excuse me for a moment… Hello, Hiyori-kun? Where are you right now?</p><p>Eh!? You spotted a good store so you went there to browse around? You’ll go to Yumenosaki once you’ve shopped to your fill?</p><p>No no, <em>please</em> don’t just do whatever you want and cause me trouble!</p><p>Hiyori-kun, wasn’t there a time you totally ignored your promise and shopped until night after saying that!?</p><p>Argh, sheesh! I’ll pick you up at the store so please tell me the name!</p><p>Please don’t move from there, okay? Geez, as impetuous as ever…!</p><p>Uugh. Umm, I’m sorry, Yuuki-kun… You too, Anzu-chan.</p><p>I think you heard our conversation; I’ll be going to the store that the Reimei kids are visiting.</p><p>So please excuse me.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, yes… I don’t know what’s going on, but please hang in there.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Sure~ This type of thing was an everyday occurrence back when I was still in <em>fine</em>, so I’m used to it to an extent.</p><p>But it’s been such long while, I’ve forgotten the tricks.</p><p>Fufu. I don’t wish to speak ill of my old friend, but…</p><p>He’s one taxing child to deal with, so… please be careful, Trickstar.</p><p>Drop your guard and you’ll just be played to the end.”</p><h2 id="omen">Omen</h2><h3 id="omen-1">Omen 1</h3><p><strong>&gt; In front of the fountain</strong></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oi, Hokke! Good morning good morning good morniiing☆”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Q6GWqa3.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Uwoh. I’m always telling you this but stop jumping at me like that, Akehoshi. I don’t know if you’ve been rolling around on the ground again or what, but you’re full of stains and you’ll dirty my clothes.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Whoa, how can you give me a scolding instead of a greeting first? What’s up, Hokke? You’re looking particularly tense today.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m my usual self. Well, perhaps I’m not…</p><p>Akehoshi, is my smile oozing with confidence like it should?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Forget that, your face muscles aren’t twitching one bit! Hokke, even though you’re part of the Theater Club, you always end up with an unnatural and stiff look whenever you try to form an expression!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, buchou often said that to me. I see, so I didn’t manage to smile… I want to show up to battle with a fearless, dignified attitude, though.</p><p>Akehoshi, do something funny.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eeh~…? Even if you suddenly say that…</p><p>‘Hello, I’m Subaru!’ ‘I’m Daikichi (<em>excellent luck</em>)!’ ‘Together, we’re the Fortune-Slip Duo!’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>‘What the heck kind of fortune slip are you!?’”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh, that wasn’t funny!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No, I’m just starting to wonder for real… What the heck kind of fortune slip are you?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hokke just gave me a <em>tsukkomi</em>!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Huh, so Daikichi-kun was with you, Akehoshi. You’ve been taking your dog on a walk?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah, the Yumenosaki Academy grounds are part of his walking trail! Daikichi’s Papa—isn’t around anymore, but apparently, he used to be taken on a walk here often.</p><p>Obviously this little guy couldn’t have remembered, but can’t something or the other possibly be passed onto his genes? Like ‘<em>This is the path I must live</em>…’ type of thing…!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What type of thing is that? Taking dogs on a walk inside the school is fundamentally forbidden. Restrain yourself. If you need a walking trail, there’s the path near the sea; take him there instead.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, we’d jog there often, huh?</p><p>But the sands might stick to him and that’ll be a pain to wash~ He’d run off to the sandy beach to look for sparkling things and hurt himself stepping on seashells and the like!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You; despite responding friendlily, you almost never listen to other people’s request and force your will through with _if_s and _but_s… Pertinacious guy.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Aren’t you the same in that regard, Hokke? Wow, peas in a pod, aren’t we! Let’s be friends forever☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Are we really? I think we’re opposites. How does the world look in your eyes?</p><p>That aside. I’ve relaxed after talking with you. Thanks, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “No problem! Doing a routine calms the mind, right? ♪</p><p>But hey, Hokke, what are you doing here in broad daylight? Theater Club stuff? Practice for that Summer Live whatever thing is in the afternoon, right?”</p><p>Damn, did I mistake the meeting time!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You didn’t, it’s fine. It’s rare of you to remember the schedule, Akehoshi. Nice work.</p><p>Our lesson starts afternoon. Don’t skip and don’t be late.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I know. That’s why I’m walking Daikichi and finishing off other business while it’s still the day.</p><p>Fufu. It’s great that my schedule’s been full lately,</p><p>but Daikichi’s gotten fat again because I’ve been too busy to walk him.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I see… I think he’s cuter all soft and round, though.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “If you think he’s cute then pet him! He’ll be happy if you pet him! Since he’s a dog!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Sorry, I’ll pass. I have to attend a meeting for the Summer Live as Trickstar’s leader.</p><p>It’ll be uncourtly to show up with dog hairs on me.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, that’s why you were worried about your clothes when we met and scolded me more harshly than usual?</p><p>But right, Trickstar’s leader was you, huh, Hokke… Is it really okay that the rest of us don’t participate in that… meeting thing?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Greeting for the rest of the members will happen in the afternoon, with the lesson.</p><p>The meeting at noon is just preparations. It appears the other leader has something to say for us, as well.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Fufufu~ Should I join you, then? If you’re left to your own device, Hokke, you’ll take every fight people pick and make things complicated!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Really? I only say what should be made clear.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “And end up in an argument every time, right? Not that I have a problem. That’s just who you are, Hokke.</p><p>I don’t really get it, but do your best on the meeting… Leader♪ Call me if you’re in a pinch. I’ll tactlessly barge in and bail you out!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t barge. Still; thanks a lot, Akehoshi.”</p><h3 id="omen-2">Omen 2</h3><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “But hey, Hokke… So in the end… what <em>is</em> the Summer Live?</p><p>We were frantic when you just suddenly broke it to us that we’ll be participating in a large-scale live and need to free up our schedules.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I don’t know the details, either. The student council president personally called me to his office and told me that.</p><p>It didn’t feel like he’d give us a choice; not that that’s any different than usual.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, you got called through a broadcast yesterday, didn’t you, Hokke? That was kinda shocking to me, like it’s going to be the second coming of the whole DDD nightmare!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm, but breaking up Trickstar this late will only demerit him. Plus, we’ve become relatively well-known to the outside world.</p><p>His order of dissolve back then was only effective because we were still newborn and unstable as a unit.</p><p>None of us will be swayed at whatever anyone says now.</p><p>We’ve solidified our base and grown strong and sturdy; this is the stage where we must improve on ourselves for SS at the end of the year.</p><p>We’re the representative for Yumenosaki Academy. Pitting us against each other and ruining us won’t benefit the student council president.</p><p>Though well, I don’t doubt that he has a hidden agenda.</p><p>However, in SS, where we must fight against power units from outside the academy, the student council president is an ally.</p><p>He’ll back us up as a fellow Yumenosaki idol… at least we have no choice but believe that.</p><p>Doesn’t mean we can slack our guard, though. This Summer Live thing is kind of fishy, too…</p><p>It seems to be something like an interschool competition, so we can’t count on what’s considered common sense in Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>We must be careful as to not shame ourselves in front of strangers. Especially you, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I know! I’ll be a good boy♪</p><p>Hokke, you shouldn’t start quarreling with the guys from the other school, too.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yeah. I know. Leave it to me, Akehoshi. My preparations are flawless, as always.</p><p>Oh, I can’t be wasting time on chatting. It’s about time to go to the student council room… We’ll see each other again at practice in the afternoon, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Of course. See ya, Hokke~…♪”</p><p><strong>&gt; Student Council Room</strong></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Excuse me.</p><p>Trickstar’s leader, Hidaka Hokuto, is here.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/MffNhGN.jpg"></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Welcome.</p><p>Fufu. I’m happy to see your face, Hokuto. You seem rather pleased; did anything good happen?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m the same as usual. I think it’s you who seem excited about something.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “To return your words: I’m the same as usual.</p><p>Fufu, it feels so nice when things are going according to your plan. As I thought, working things out in the background is so much easier and relaxing.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Are you scheming something again, Student Council President?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “What sort of character do you take me for? Well, I brought that upon myself, so I guess I can’t complain.</p><p>I’m not scheming anything evil. It’s just another setup to grant the dream I long for.</p><p>In any case, it seems our guest will be late, so you’ll have to wait. Take a seat, Hokuto.</p><p>How about a cup of tea? I’ve gotten hold of some exquisite tea leaves.</p><p>My doctor restricted my consumption of caffeine, but drinking isn’t the only way to enjoy a tea.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What are you babbling on about…? I don’t need tea when I can’t tell what you put in it.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “A pity. They’re <em>so</em> good, though~… Don’t be so nervous, Hokuto.</p><p>A clever boy like you would know that I’m not your enemy in this situation.</p><p>While I can’t have you depending on me too much, I still wish to back you up, since you guys are Yumenosaki Academy’s representative.</p><p>That’s what the Summer Live is for. A practice for the coming SS; a chance to compete with a powerful opponent of another school.</p><p>I’ll be sending you guys for more of such <em>pilgrimages</em> in the future to let you earn abundance of experience. It’s better that you learn the ropes as fast as you can.</p><p>One of these days, I’ll send you on a job befitting of a representative of Yumenosaki.</p><p>Calling in opponents from other schools to Yumenosaki Academy to fight against, for one. Depending on the situation, perhaps even a live tour throughout the country.</p><p>I want you to feel the broadness of the world and confront SS with the proper gravity.</p><p>It’ll turn out dangerous, if all you know is the miniature garden that is this Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>Know of the great ocean, little frog in the well♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “If I’m to be honest, I wish I can participate more in DreamFests inside the school.</p><p>Plans that involve other schools don’t count into the DreamFest system, so they do nothing to our grades whether we win or lose.</p><p>Isn’t this just you making us pursue exhausting jobs that don’t reflect on our report card, strangling us with a silk floss to weaken us?</p><p>Your methods are underhanded, as always.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “That’s your persecutory delusion. But this is unexpected; I didn’t think you were the type to care for grades.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “My parents like numbers. They scolded me because my grades have been falling lately.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. That’s how the world of adults is—the capitalist society is ruled by numbers, you see. Momentary passion will fade like a phantasm with the passage of time.</p><p>They all forget. So surprisingly easily.</p><p>What remains is results—in other words, numbers. My position allows me, to an extent, to manipulate these numbers inside Yumenosaki Academy at will.</p><p>You should be careful with how you address me. How about using polite language as a start?</p><p>So you won’t be insolent to our guest from the other school, how about I beat the rules of etiquette into you?♪”</p><h3 id="omen-3">Omen 3</h3><p><strong>&gt; Student Council Room</strong></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Here is your tea, Hokuto.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I told you I don’t need it.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “And <em>I</em> told you to address me politely. We’re both being obstinate, so it’s all fair. You’ll tire yourself being so inflexible, just relax.</p><p>You know, Hajime-kun from my Tea Club loves herbs; lately, I had the family gardener raise some for me.</p><p>They’re still of lower quality than those sold in stores, so I’ll have you drink them.</p><p>Perhaps herbs raised in my house are too horrid for you to put in your mouth?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t make fun of me. I’ll take it. (<em>Gulp</em>)… Hmm, it tastes like tea.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Because it’s tea. Anyway, Hiyori-kun is so late… He hasn’t changed, not caring about time. It’s becoming tiring to wait.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hiyori…?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Yes. That’s the person you’ll be partnering with for the Summer Live.</p><p>You should remember him. He transferred out at the end of the previous school year… but he was a student at Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>Tomoe Hiyori-kun, a former <em>fine</em>. I won’t allow you to say you’ve forgotten, Hokke Mask-kun♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…One of the two leading stars of the former <em>fine</em>. So he transferred out. Come to think of it, I haven’t heard rumors of him as of late.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “You should be more aware of those around you.</p><p>I know your hands are full with just your own problems, but being able to see the surroundings is one requirement of a leader.</p><p>In any case, he’s one half of the famous duo that was <em>fine</em>’s main force. His strengths as an idol are equal—or far greater—than that of mine…</p><p>You’ll be eaten alive were you to drop your guard.</p><p>You must’ve heard rumors. About the most nationally esteemed unit in our age group… the unrivaled, Eden.</p><p>They’re the strongest contender for winning SS; the unit that’ll become your most formidable enemy.</p><p>Hiyori-kun is part of Eve, a unit that is deeply related to Eden, you see…</p><p>I believe he’s the perfect opponent to test your skills for SS.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm, I’ve heard of Eden, but not Eve…</p><p>You said they’re deeply related, but in what way, exactly? It seems they both took their names from the Bible for some reason.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. That’s the funny part, Hokuto.</p><p>It seems Hiyori-kun’s Eve, alongside another unit called Adam, combine to form Eden.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Combine…?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Sounds like a giant robot, doesn’t it? I’m currently looking into the details by using the student council to gather data for me.</p><p>It seems Eve and Adam’s relationship is truly like a couple.</p><p>There’s a series of schools branched from the same idol agency, Reimei Academy and Shuuetsu Academy<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>…</p><p>It seems they have “Eve” and “Adam” as separate units, placed in these respective schools.</p><p>And sometimes, those two units combine into one and perform as Eden.</p><p>It’s not a very common method, so I don’t fully understand the concept, either.</p><p>Doesn’t it sound like a joke? Yet, they’re undoubtedly strong.</p><p>Perhaps even we, the current <em>fine</em>, are no match to them. Their business methods are tricky, but above that, their individual skills are frighteningly high.</p><p>Honestly, I can’t think of a hand to use against Eden right now.</p><p>So we’re going to deal with unmerged Eve and Adam one by one, in hopes we can find a hint to defeating them.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… That Tomoe Hiyori from Eve was a former member of <em>fine</em>, which means he was your ally.</p><p>Shouldn’t you have grasped most of his strength?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Well, those two were beyond my control even at that time, you see…</p><p>There’s also the possibility that upon transferring and gathering many different experiences, he’s evolved into an existence far beyond my imagination.</p><p>But at least compared to Nagisa-kun, Hiyori-kun should be easier to manage. The driving force of all his actions is simple, after all: <em>Nothing else matters as long as I’m satisfied.</em></p><p>Compared to Nagisa-kun’s slipperiness, that’s still easier to deal with. Plus, Hiyori-kun has the sweet mercy of nobility. Even supposing things take turn for the worst, well… he won’t kill you.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You always use such violent expressions… Hmm?</p><p>I hear footsteps. Is that not Tomoe Hiyori coming?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “No, this is…?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/GW9qrzo.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “’Scuse me~ Huh, is the meeting with Eve not done yet?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Good morning, Isara. Are you going to join our meeting?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Hey, Hokuto. What’s up? ♪ Awfully hot day, huh? I got really sweaty after all that working in the archive room.</p><p>Anyway, you’re Trickstar’s leader, aren’t you? I’m not gonna take your job from you. I just came to deliver the documents the President asked.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Don’t slave my comrade around, President.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “No no, Isara-kun was the one who asked if there was any work to do.</p><p>I didn’t wish to tire you Trickstar kids before Summer Live, either.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Well, I feel the best when I’m a little bit busy. And I’m just doing my quota as a student council member.</p><p>Here ya go, I’ll leave your documents here.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Thank you. Since you’re here, I wouldn’t mind if you join our meeting.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nah, I’ll leave talking with the bigshots to Hokuto and his nerves of steel. It’s going to drain the life out of a lower middle class like me.</p><p>And I haven’t had lunch, so I’m thinking to get something for my stomach.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Ah, it’s time for lunch already… I’m starting to feel hungry, too.</p><p>That cursed Hiyori-kun, he’s made us wait for too long. He couldn’t have gone home, could he…?</p><p>Geez. He hasn’t changed, still the same boy who won’t move to my plan.”</p><h3 id="omen-4">Omen 4</h3><p><strong>&gt; Arcade</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Noqf2G2.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ehehe. Isn’t it great your shopping went quick, Anzu-chan?</p><p>They do say that it’s better to settle errands as fast as possible. If not, you’ll find yourself too tired for the actual important job, and trip up over a careless mistake.</p><p>Just kidding; was that too arrogant of me… hya!?</p><p>W-What? Why did you press a cold sports drink against my neck?</p><p>Ah, did you expect some artful, exaggerated reaction from me!? I’m sorry I wasn’t funny enough!</p><p>Fufu. So because it’s awfully hot today as expected of summer, I should keep myself from being dehydrated… is it? That’s what you thought, so you bought this from the vending machine for me?</p><p>Thank you~ I feel bad that you paid for this, so I would love to pay you back; but I’ll take it as a tip for helping you with shopping.</p><p>Hehe, it might be condescending of me, but we managed to do our shopping efficiently and smartly thanks to me looking up shops on the internet, after all.</p><p>I’m so glad~ That I was of use to you, Anzu-chan♪</p><p>If all I could do was slow you down despite being the one to offer assistance to start with, that would seriously make me a useless kid who needs to be babysat.</p><p>I was panicked, though~ I thought you might need another pair of hands to carry the luggage since you said you were going shopping, but…</p><p>Then it turned out all the ordered items would be sent directly to Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>I’m glad I managed to be of some assistance at least with searching for shops.</p><p>Fufu. Now we have a lot of free time. Anzu-chan, you don’t have anything special to do after this either, right?</p><p>Then let’s kill some time until afternoon practice… and head to the academy together. Be there for our practice for Summer Live, okay?</p><p>Uhh, was that alright? Voice out your opinions sometimes, okay~? Is this fine? Am I not forcing my company on you and troubling you, Anzu-chan?</p><p>Umm, if you don’t hate it, I was wondering if we could play at the arcade together. But do you prefer that we go to a café, Anzu-chan?</p><p>Umm, so you know. In the Game Club that I used to be part of, there was this almost-legendary, amazing upperclassman…</p><p>He gave up on being an idol, dropped out, and somehow entered a video game company.</p><p>Yeah, that upperclassman I brought up when we were telling you about the past.</p><p>So apparently, that upperclassman finally finished developing this one game which planning was entrusted to him.</p><p>It’s the sequel to a popular title, so it seems the arcade has it.</p><p>It’s a title I’ve always liked, plus I’m curious what kind of game an upperclassman I’m acquainted with could’ve made… I was hoping to play that game.</p><p>Will you join me? Do girls not like games…?</p><p>Not true? Ah, your little brother used to love video games, so you often played with him, huh…?</p><p>If you don’t know the newer titles, maybe we should play retro games instead.</p><p>This arcade is filled with all sorts of those.</p><p>Look, there’s P<em>cman and G</em>adius and also Super Gu*sun Oyoyo…♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Oi.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, look! As you’d expect from Yumenosaki Academy’s territory~ They have crane games with a bunch of idol goods!</p><p>How about Trickstar goods… Hmm, I’m not really seeing them.</p><p>Good if it’s because they’re so popular they ran out fast; but most likely we’re just not popular enough.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Oi!

I’m talking ‘bout cash, y’know.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eh, eh?”</p><p>(Eeek!? What’s going on? Just as my outing with Anzu-chan is getting to feel like a date!</p><p>I didn’t think we’d run into trouble~ Getting called out by a boy who looks somewhat like a thug!</p><p>What does he mean by cash? No way… is he extorting me!?</p><p>I-If we can settle things with money I’d hand it over to him with a ‘sorry’ and run away, but! How can I be so pathetic with Anzu-chan right there looking at me?</p><p>But I can’t fight, and just by being involved in violence, my career as an idol will be taking a blow…</p><p>Rather, shouldn’t I just apologize and run away, before Anzu-chan gets in trouble too?</p><p>I’m totally fine being made fun of!</p><p>But I can’t let a thug getting near Anzu-chan and saying and doing cruel things to her!)</p><p>“E-Excuse me?

I don’t get it but it’s scary!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Hmm~… On the other hand, do you have no idea who I am?</p><p>Well, I <em>am</em> the newest guy in Eden, and they’re such a flashy bunch I might be overshadowed in comparison, so~”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eden… You mean <em>that</em> Eden? Considered the top among student idols, the strongest candidate for winning SS!?</p><p>Ah… don’t tell me you guys are the one we’re co-starring with in Summer Live? Uwaah, matching up against Eden is too much!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “No, it’s a joint live not a match, and we’re participating as Eve, not Eden.</p><p>Hmm~… Judging from that reaction, doesn’t seem like you’ve dug up on us.</p><p>We’re being made light of, I see. Keh, don’t be so full of yourself just because you’ve gotten a little popular.</p><p>We took the trouble to free up some time in our packed schedule to come all the way here, y’know?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Huh!? He’s begun sulking! What a difficult kid…!</p><p>Umm, I’m sorry. It’s just we haven’t received any detailed explanation on the Summer Live, see?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “So you neglected looking up even a little about the people you’ll be costarring with~?

Eat lots and become a big man.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Sakuma-senpai, you look sleepy… Well, it’s the middle of the day, so usually it’s your time to sleep, isn’t it?</p><p>But the cafeteria floors are actually pretty dirty, so you shouldn’t lie around down there.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Yes, but the season being as it is, it is too stifling to be inside the coffin…</p><p>While I was roaming over the school for a cool place that can shield me from the sun, I just found myself at this place.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “What terrifying sleepwalking habits… But wasn’t your coffin equipped with air conditioner?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “The little thing is being sent for maintenance~ It broke down recently when I washed my coffin.</p><p>I asked Mikejima-kun to fix it up for me.</p><p>That child is skilled with jobs of that nature; fiddling with machines, making musical instruments…</p><p>As to be expected of my successor. He can do anything if he tries.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Huh, he didn’t look the type… I mean, assuming he’s not dexterous because he’s huge would be prejudiced, I guess.</p><p>Anyway, how did you know there will be lesson for Summer Live this afternoon, Sakuma-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Kukuku. I know everything; anything there is about Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>To reveal my trick, however—I have the hobby of wandering around the garden terrace, you see.</p><p>Occasionally I would have a light exchange with Tenshouin-kun, who has made this area the meeting place for his club.</p><p>Tenshouin-kun appeared more grave than usual… He even sought for my opinion. Perhaps it would rain today.</p><p>In any case, as it is the nature of demons to answer when inquired, I bestowed upon him some advice.</p><p>I have many connections, including outside of the school, so I even became a mediator for him.</p><p>How curious, that a day would come where Tenshouin-kun and I cooperate for the same goal… I hope you would not let our efforts to waste.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yeah, we’ll give it our all. But it doesn’t feel real, that we’ll represent Yumenosaki Academy for SS.</p><p>It all feels like a dream. Until recently, we were nobodies.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “But it is real. You must advance with such grave resolve, or you would fail to gain anything, merely broken up to pieces as the storm passes through you.</p><p>Show your best efforts; we are here to support you.</p><p>Of course, were you to find yourself in some sort of trouble, you are free to seek my advice and I shall give it to you, Isara-kun.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Thank you very much, Sakuma-senpai.</p><p>In reality, we Trickstar still don’t have enough skills or name. Without everyone around us to help, we’ll be nothing.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Well, relying on no one does not necessarily make you strong.</p><p>No matter how great a demon, they will one day fall at the hands of the great mass that repeatedly challenges them.</p><p>Your opponent, Eve, is a two-person unit. You are above them in terms of numbers.</p><p>Plus, the Summer Live will be held in our home base. You have many fans here.</p><p>Take advantage of the geography, enchant the mass, and raise as heroes once more.</p><p>As protagonists of a story… yes? Do well, and I shall give you a pat on the head♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Please don’t treat me like a kid~…</p><p>Well, it’s not like we have the choice to return to starting point like in a game of sugoroku. Gotta pull ourselves together and advance forward.</p><p>That our enemy remains unknown is what’s scary. The president asked me to gather some records, but I still don’t grasp anything vital about them.</p><p>The leader of Eve, Tomoe Hiyori-senpai was enrolled to Yumenosaki Academy in the past…</p><p>I thought we would have data on his special skills, or his signature songs.</p><p>In reality, couldn’t find a thing even after fishing through the entire archive room. Being the scion of some wealthy clan, he must be thorough in the protection of his personal info.</p><p>If I knew this would happen, I would’ve been more serious and kept track of <em>fine</em>’s stages as a first year.</p><p>I just skipped past them, thinking those extravagant happenings were beyond me.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Fufu. That’s because that was how Tenshouin-kun’s group set it up to be.</p><p>During that era… Save for the protagonists, <em>fine</em>, and the evil they must defeat, the Five Oddballs—the rest of you were purposefully reduced to witnesses to the story.</p><p>Not given the right to leave the seats until the performance ended, your role was simply to shower them with applause…</p><p>It was a solid story, after all; and to begin with, protagonists have the unique power to move their surroundings in such way.</p><p>However, you children broke free from that curse and just once, managed to win against <em>fine</em>… against Tenshouin-kun.</p><p>Without letting the past heroes toying with you as they please—show us the power of you youths.</p><p>You have my expectations, Trickstar.”</p><h3 id="foreign-enemy-2">Foreign Enemy 2</h3><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Right, right. If I were to give you an advice… if memory serves, Sakasaki-kun devotedly collects even records that have been officially erased in his underground secret study.</p><p>You may go to him if you desire information, though he might ask for something in exchange… I will speak to him if he makes things difficult.</p><p>Also, there is no real way to cut off the flow of information in this day and age.</p><p>You may benefit from asking your precious comrade, Yuuki-kun, to search for information on the <em>in-ter-net</em>. Isn’t that child knowledgeable in that area?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “True. But Makoto forgets about restraint too easily to be carelessly counted on.</p><p>If he ends up devoting everything to that task and forgetting about the real Summer Live, that’s mistaking the means for the end.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Kukuku. Once he decides on a course of action, that child’s concentration power is far above normal.</p><p>That’s what you call talent; his gift may rival even us the Five Oddballs’.</p><p>Of course—geniuses and heroes, monsters and unknown creatures…</p><p>To take control of them, to nestle by their side as an ally and bestow salvation upon them is the role that normal humans like you play, Isara-kun.</p><p>Show me you can accomplish that. If not, you will not raise victorious in this deadly war against the powerful idols of the country.</p><p>Well, Isara-kun; you are already used to dealing with my cute little brother… You know the tricks to taming monsters like the back of your hand, yes?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Monster, huh… So~mehow, that just doesn’t fit Makoto.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oooi, Sally! I knew it’s Sally! Yahoo yahoo yahoo☆”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Aqutef4.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “…Oh, here comes the more blatant type of monster.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “What are you talking about? Doesn’t matter, I guess. So Sally, how about we go running together?</p><p>We’ll only practice indoors today, so now’s the only time you can dash all you like, you know? ☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “No no, I just finished eating. My flank will ache if I run.</p><p>You’re energetic as ever, Subaru. Rather, aren’t you powering up by the day?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahahaha! I love summer! The whole world is sparkling☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Summer’s just starting. Even you’ll run out of gas if you start it with a dash, Subaru.</p><p>Here; if you’ve run to your fill then make sure to keep hydrated.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yaay, warm tea! I love warm tea☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. We’ll hurt our stomachs if we keep consuming cold drinks just because it’s hot, after all. Well, not that I’ve ever seen you get sick, though.”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Yes. To be born healthy is a treasure. You should thank your parents for it.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? For some reason, Sakuma-senpai is napping on the ground! Hello, sir!</p><p>You guys had meal together? You get along well, huh~? Sally seems to be really close to Sakuma-senpai’s little brother… so are you two childhood friends too?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Not quite, we just had a fortuitous encounter.</p><p>Ritsu will sulk if I act friendly with Isara-kun, so I try not to cross the line… Not to mention there have been traces of him purposefully trying to keep us away.</p><p>I would never steal Isara-kun away from him, so he should not be so wary.</p><p>Ah, well. Ritsu will nag on me if he sees us, so I will take my leave.</p><p>I apologize for making you go along with my rambling, Isara-kun.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “It’s fine. Thank you for the useful information… Rei-chan♪”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Eh, why did you suddenly call me like we’re childhood friends? You just felt like it? To borrow a certain someone’s wording: I don’t get youths these days and their sense of distance…!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. Just kidding. You seem weakened from the sunlight, so if you can’t move, should I carry you until you get inside?”</p><p><strong>Rei:</strong> “Do not mind me; reserve your energy. I still have no need for nursing, you know?</p><p>You too, Akehoshi-kun—stamina isn’t boundless… Think carefully on how you’d like to spend it.</p><p>That’s how it is in the world for the best. That is the sort of stage you now stand on.</p><p>Then if you will excuse me. The Summer Live is held during the day, and I may not be able to go to see you, depending on the weather…</p><p>But I shall encourage you from the heart, gentlemen from Trickstar♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah! Thank you very much for the encouragement☆”</p><p><em>&gt; Rei left</em>.</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha! Hey, did you see that just now? Sakuma-senpai grabbed a tomato growing on the roadside as he left and took a bite, didn’t he?</p><p>Do you know that’s the tomato plant Gami-san has been growing?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Wait. Speak in order; I have no idea what’s supposed to be funny.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “So, so! That plot on the side of the road was where Gami-san used to grow onions to take down Sakuma-senpai, you see?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Hmm~… Wait a bit, I’ll listen as we run. You were jogging in full speed until now; you shouldn’t abruptly stop like that.</p><p>I’ll join you, so you focus on cooling down.</p><p>I wanna work off my meal too, so I’ll have a light jog. I think I’ll be at best condition by our lesson time if I do some running.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, you’ll run with me? Okaay, then it’s a match! <em>Babyu~un☆</em>”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “No, I told you to cool down, okay? What’s heating up more gonna do for you? Even the sun will burn out one day, so seriously, think about how you’ll pace yourself.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh~? But Trickstar’s all about pushing forward to reach any place without thinking what’s beyond☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “I’m saying that method might not work forever… I guess that’s fine though, that <em>is</em> our special trait as Trickstar.</p><p>Let’s give today’s lesson our all, as always… Subaru.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You can count on me! I’ll be shining even stronger than the summer sun! It won’t even be <em>sparkling</em> anymore, but <em>sparking</em>…☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Honestly, you’re so full of energy it worries me… Geez, I’m starting to get excited because of your influence here♪”</p><h3 id="foreign-enemy-3">Foreign Enemy 3</h3><p><strong>&gt; Student Council room</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/MrZWLVU.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. I think I’ve grasped the outline of the Summer Live, for the most part.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Really, now. I suppose having the chance to explain things to you is one benefit to take from our guest’s late entrance.</p><p>If Eve—or more like Hiyori-kun decides to throw away this job, Summer Live won’t be able to happen…</p><p>We’ll have no choice but to cancel, so all this explanation may go to waste.</p><p>Ah, no, when that happens, perhaps I should have some random unit from our school participate as Eve’s replacement.</p><p>Judging from recent events, Valkyrie and Switch should do.</p><p>I’ll be able to unearth some inside facts about those secretive units by pitting them against Trickstar.</p><p>You all have the fervor that can bring out the wholeness of the opponent you collide against, after all.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’ll take that as a compliment. Even if I dislike how that makes us sound like poison tasters, or rather, human sacrifices.</p><p>No matter who we go against, we’ll never cut corners; we’ll fight with everything of us, without running away.&quot;</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “That’s what I expect of you. You’re still young, anyway, so without thinking too hard about the distant future…</p><p>I want you to make the most out of every second with determination—such that you won’t mind even if your fire were to die out this moment.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s what we strive for. Still, Summer Live only lasts a day, but the preparation period looks needlessly long.</p><p>I don’t believe constructing the stage and advertising the event should take that much time and effort.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Yes. While the Live itself is important, I want you to take care to interact with the people from the other school.</p><p>It’s your first interschool match; it must not be so easy to get used to foreign culture.</p><p>I’m not forcing you to be friends with them, of course, since they’re enemies you eventually have to kill, anyway.</p><p>The preparation period may seem long, but it’s only one-week long.</p><p>Get them to take you seriously during that period; I don’t care if it’s antagonism or pure hatred, make them lay bare some form of genuine emotion.</p><p>It doesn’t matter that your opponent is a senior, or a member of the strongest unit. Howl and sink your teeth into them and fight to your last breath.</p><p>All to seek out even the slightest hint to conquering Eden.</p><p>It’s in war that the true nature of human becomes bare. You should challenge them, provoke them, get them to take you seriously. Isn’t that your forte, Hokuto?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Am I really that confrontational? Akehoshi also said something similar.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “The fact you don’t realize that is both a problem and your strength.</p><p>…Hmm? I got a text from Tsumugi. It seems Hiyori-kun is finally coming.</p><p>We ended up relaxing and dwelling on idle chat, but you should straighten your posture now.</p><p>I think Hiyori-kun would make some really outrageous statements, but try not to be thrown off.</p><p>Counter his words proudly. Stay quiet and you’ll be swallowed by his one-sided babbling.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Ngz5LVE.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes, I hear someone gossiping about me!</p><p>Thank you! For thinking about me! For sacrificing a slice of your lifetime!</p><p>That’s the way, keep at it! Lift up the domination of your soul to Tomoe Hiyori, more and more!</p><p>Hello! I’m sorry for being late—at least I’ll leave an apology as a formality!</p><p>Why, it’s the man you’ve been waiting for! Here is Tomoe Hiyori of Eve…☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “……”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/w5oqkCB.jpg"></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Hey, now… What a big attitude coming from someone who arrived unbelievably <em>late</em>. Not that I didn’t expect it.</p><p>Can you at least pretend to be a little apologetic?</p><p>Anyway, your voice is as loud as ever. Look at how perplexed you’ve left this child… Hokuto, be. He’s making the face of a pigeon who’s been shot by a peashooter.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes, my loud voice is a born trait!</p><p>Since I’ve been born to this world, I shall take to assert myself with my all! I have a large lung capacity anyway, so doing so does not disadvantage me by any means!</p><p>Rather than that! Wow, Eichi-kun! It’s really you, Eichi-kun! Long time no see!</p><p>What a shock to see you’re still breathing…♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “…Are you dissatisfied that I’m alive?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Not really? I don’t care either way!</p><p>I’m not in <em>fine</em> anymore; not your pawn, right? So Eichi-kun, you no longer have much impact on my life—you’re a stranger!”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Huh. Talk about cheeky. I’m telling you this as a sarcasm, but: I’m glad to see you haven’t changed… Hiyori-kun. Once again, long time no see.</p><p>Thank you for answering to our invitation for Summer Live.</p><p>Come on, Hokuto, you should give your work partner a greeting or two.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Ah, right.</p><p>Pleased to meet you. I’m the leader of Trickstar, who will costar with you in the Summer Live… My name is Hidaka Hokuto.</p><p>It’s an honor to be able to work with you.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Hmm? Ah, I know I know! This is a joint live, right?</p><p>I’m not that interested so I didn’t bother to look it up, but I see… Trickstar, is what you’re called?</p><p>Hello! Let’s try to get along! I hope you would work hard as our prop, Trickstar♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Prop, you say?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Right. If just that much can make you angry, you’ll have a tough time forming a conversation with him, so swallow that down. First, since it won’t get anywhere like this, please keep your greetings <em>normal</em>.</p><p>But still…your boasting is as big as ever; I trust your skills haven’t rusted either?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ahaha! You’ve been acting so strangely condescending since we started, Eichi-kun! That’s funny, are you misunderstanding that you’re <em>above</em> me? How wretched!”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I’ll return the exact same words to you, Hiyori-kun.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (Wow, I can see sparks flying… This two were supposed to be part of the same <em>fine</em>, but…</p><p>From the looks of it, do they not get along very well?)</p><h3 id="foreign-enemy-4">Foreign Enemy 4</h3><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Anyway, Tsumugi was supposed to pick you up, but… I don’t see him. Don’t tell me you left him behind, Hiyori-kun?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Oh, I’m having Tsumugi-kun transport my things to the hotel!</p><p>I had a little too much fun shopping, but it was such pain to carry all of the luggage myself, you know?</p><p>Well, he has nothing to do with our current topic, so what does it matter? Leave that side character be, and let’s start our discussion as the main roles!</p><p>Okay, so I’ll lay down Eve’s plans for Summer Live, first of all!</p><p>If possible, I need you to move only as I instruct you to… as I desire!</p><p>That way, we’ll definitely succeed! There’s no demerit for you, is there?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Wha—Wait a second. What are you just suddenly… that’s too one-sided. This is a joint live, so we must work on even footing. We’ll try to be as cooperative as possible, too.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes, I’m happy you feel that way! But do you know only unsatisfactory results can be borne out of matching with those who are inept?</p><p>How unbearable were a Live that Tomoe Hiyori, that Eve participates in… ends up as such an uneventful, tasteless, and tedious piece of art.</p><p>We consented to cooperating with you due to instructions from our agency this time. To be perfectly honest though, I’d love to excuse myself from having to costar with minor characters like you all.</p><p>At least try not to get in the way, okay? I’ll kick you out of the stage if you turn out to be such an ugly sight.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “…Don’t look at me for help, Hokuto. I told you beforehand that he’s <em>this</em> sort of child, right?</p><p>Being your mutual acquaintance, I’m simply here to set up a meeting for you two and act as the mediator.</p><p>I’d like to refrain from getting involved in deciding the content of the Summer Live.</p><p>I can’t have you depending on me too much, really. Well, though if you <em>really</em> insist…</p><p>Anyway, everything starts from experience. Just try to deal with this by yourselves as a start.</p><p>I’ll offer you an advice, at least: if you don’t counter his argument with something, Hiyori-kun will selfishly move onto the next topics.</p><p>At least show some resistance before it’s too late.</p><p>Negotiate with perseverance, work hard so Trickstar can reap even the slightest bit of benefit.</p><p>The fight has started. Drop your guard, and it’ll end when he’s done exploiting every bit of you.</p><p>So that you can protect your precious comrades, Trickstar… No, so you can polish them to shine brighter—leave no stone unturned.</p><p>That’s your role to play, Trickstar’s _leader-kun_♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes, how soft of you, Eichi-kun! You’re taking the effort to explain every little thing to him?</p><p>I see you’re being a proper <em>senpai</em>! Wow, human beings really do grow, after all!</p><p>But it’s a little… irksome. I wish you’d leave the room, because this boy will be hard to manipulate to my convenience if you’re here.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I’m shamelessly attending your meeting like this exactly so I can prevent that.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “So kind. No—you really have changed, Eichi-kun. You used to have more spark, like how Nagisa-kun has been recently.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. It seems you’re still the best of friends with him.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Nah, I just like him one-sidedly! He doesn’t mingle with anyone; after all, he’s a child who lacks the function to love another human!</p><p>But well, he’s one of the numerable few… whose existences I permit in this Earth. And our affinity is unsurpassable, so I think of him as a lifelong partner.</p><p>There’s the agency’s instruction too, of course, but <em>that</em> is the main reason I still work together with that exasperating boy as Eden.</p><p>After all, I would refuse to stand, for even a second, next to someone I dislike.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Hmm. Well, that <em>someone</em> standing next to you probably thinks the exact same thing as you.</p><p>In any case, thanks to Hiyori-kun’s implacably late arrival, our schedule is pressed for time.</p><p>This meeting, or rather, the time you have left to talk face-to-face with him like this will run out soon.</p><p>Say something, Hokuto. If not for his agency forcing him to, he really won’t deign to converse with someone who doesn’t interest him.</p><p>Maybe you won’t get another chance at discussion.</p><p>If you have something to say, do that while there’s still time”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No. I predict talking will get me nowhere. He’s completely looking down on me.</p><p>Tomoe… senpai doesn’t seem to lend ears to those he views to be below him.</p><p>Then I must start from proving ourselves to him. We’ll show you what we’re capable of during the afternoon practice.</p><p>I’ll prove that we’re a beneficial unit to partner with.</p><p>That’s when any discussion is feasible. Isn’t that right, Tomoe-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes, unexpectedly enough, you can see through what is truly important! Most people would shrivel upon their first contact with me.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I’m no stranger to dealing with hyperactive weirdos, circumstances being as they are.”</p><h3 id="foreign-enemy-5">Foreign Enemy 5</h3><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/29zIlWo.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Hmm… What’s your name again?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Didn’t I introduce myself already? You should care to remember, since we’re partnering up, even if temporary.</p><p>No matter. Let me introduce myself once more—I’m Hidaka Hokuto from Trickstar.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Hidaka… Haha, I thought I’ve head your voice somewhere before. Even your visage bears some resemblance to him; you must be the rumored son of Hidaka-sensei, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hidaka…sensei?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I mean your father, of course. It appears he has a busy schedule, still being active as an idol, but sometimes, he’d be invited to Reimei Academy as a lecturer and take upon teaching.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Aah… My father doesn’t refuse any job offer as a rule, after all. That’s how he preserves for so long in the industry.</p><p>Even so, I didn’t think he’d take upon teaching in a rival school, when he’s an alumnus of Yumenosaki.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I heard he used to keep turning down our offer, out of respect for Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>I don’t know what changed, but around Spring, he suddenly decided to accept the offer.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Spring… Around the same timing our participation in SS was decided, then.</p><p>Why? Why is he training our opponents into stronger enemies? When he didn’t even leave a word of praise for me?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Who knows? Maybe he wants to knock his rebellious son down a peg, and reeducate him into an obedient, good boy?</p><p>I wish you guys wouldn’t bring your family problems to the stage.</p><p>But that person is a professional, anyway, so I don’t suppose he’s cutting corners as an educator.</p><p>In reality, he <em>is</em> good at teaching… So much that if he decides to retire as an idol, we’d love to have him as Reimei Academy’s exclusive teacher.</p><p>I’m learning a lot of things from him, too.</p><p>Interesting, isn’t it? The son and the student of the man who was once the top idol will be partnering up.</p><p>No—in SS, we’ll fight against each other with naked swords.</p><p>Almost like fate. Ah, how bothersome is that… I want to strive on by pursuing things that are purer, brighter, and truer to essence.</p><p>That’s what a fine weather is<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>…♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I don’t get it. Rather than that, I really want to fix up this plan some, since it’s looking too convenient for Eve.</p><p>We’ll need to negotiate for both our ends until our joint lesson in the afternoon.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes; that’s such a pain so I refuse!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I see. I’ll take that it means you have no particular opinion on the matter.</p><p>Then I’ll rework the entire plan to be favorable for Trickstar. No objections, I assume?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Eichi-kun, Eichi-kun! This kid surprisingly has some gall! I’m peeved!”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. Don’t think you can make him obey that easily, just because he’s younger. I’ve lost to them once, myself; you’ll find the rug pulled from under you if you don’t pay attention.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Eeh~ So many bothersome things to deal with… What a foul weather…</p><p>If I knew I’ll need to do some troubling negotiations, I would have brought Jun-kun with me and left him to do everything.</p><p>But well, I’m still Eve’s leader anyway, so I’ll do the important things myself without relying on the underling.</p><p>That’s the noblesse oblige, isn’t it? That <em>the King reigns but does not govern</em> is my ideal, though.</p><p>Reality never seems to go as we desire, does it? Ah, how vexing.</p><p>No helping it, in any case. If I’ll be doing it, I’ll do it seriously. And grasp victory, absolutely.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> (The air around him changed. What a powerful glint.

It’s not like they cost fortune anyway.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “But still, I prefer to keep money-related matters clear.

True that it was scary at first, how you’d horn in on any game machine I chose and kept picking a fight…</p><p>But that gave me the chance to enjoy the PvP type games I tend to avoid.</p><p>In the end, I won everything, though. Wasn’t it boring for you, Sazanami-kun, since you kept losing?</p><p>You’re our guest we invited for Summer Live, after all… Should I have played at a beginner level, or something?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Nah, I’m grateful you took it seriously. To tell you the truth, I was told to playtest that fighting game we played at the start.</p><p>But I don’t usually play games… I can’t spot mistakes, and my review’s just gonna sound like a total amateur’s…</p><p>It was a lot of help you covered that for me, Yuuki-san.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. I’m happy to be of help, then. But why were you asked to playtest, anyway?</p><p>Supposedly, that fighting game was developed by someone who used to be a Yumenosaki student, you know…?</p><p>Were you involved in some way, or rather, had some connection on that side?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Ah~ So you couldn’t tell. That game’s theme song was sung by Eden.</p><p>Following that, advertising is sort of included in the contract, too.</p><p>So the staff told us to try out the game if we have time and put up a review on our social media or something.</p><p>Just as an extra service that doesn’t warrant being called work.</p><p>Either way, that’s still an important detail. Obviously we can’t write up a review without playing the game first—and that’s rude to them, anyway.</p><p>So well, I wanted to try it out with my own hands.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I know what you mean. That’s wonderful of you, Sazanami-kun… But still, that’s amazing. So you guys sing theme songs for games too? Woow, you’re like a real idol♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “You’re an idol too, you know.</p><p>Well, Yumenosaki Academy kinda seems to raise artists whose activity centers on live concerts, which means the type of job you take probably differs from us who do multimedia.</p><p>Though, we shouldn’t keep chatting like this… We can’t afford to be late to practice, so let’s get a move.</p><p>I came from outside, so I’m not familiar with the area… If it’s okay with you, could you show me the way to Yumenosaki Academy?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Of course. It must be some kind of fortune that we met up, so let’s go together♪</p><p>You’re fine with it too, aren’t you, Anzu-chan? There’s still some time, so we could drop by somewhere if you’d like; maybe you’d like to buy something before we go?</p><p>Maybe we should get a little gift for the guests, after all?</p><p>Some famous local product as a souvenir to be brought home…?</p><p>It’s my first time with this type of situation, so I don’t know about the common practice.”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Ah, don’t mind us. Even if you give us something, we don’t know what to do; it’ll just add onto our luggage~</p><p>And it feels like bribe, which isn’t very comfortable~… Unless that’s what you’re shooting for?</p><p>I only know the rumors, but word is that Yumenosaki Academy’s rapidly festering.</p><p>Heard they’re having their way with the industry through methods that don’t involve the students’ skills as idols.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “No no, that’s a misunderstanding! True that it got into a somewhat unfortunate shape in the past, but we’ve gotten back on our feet lately!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Heh… Then why not prove that?</p><p>Talking is easy. But you guys are lacking too many things for me to just nod and take your word~</p><p>For the time being, I’ll respect you and be a <em>good boy</em>, but…</p><p>We still don’t view you as work partners of equal standing, you know~?”</p><h3 id="exchange-2">Exchange 2</h3><p><strong>&gt; Corridor 2F</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/AVPopXe.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> (Ugh~ This is bad, we’ll be late if we don’t hurry~ I thought we still had time, so we went to the garden terrace for lunch.</p><p>For a while, we split up with Anzu-chan because she had to report her shopping… as part of work.</p><p>After being left alone with Sazanami-kun, I didn’t know what to do.</p><p>I’m hopeless, still so timid no matter how much time passes… I thought I was getting a little better at talking lately, but that might have been my imagination.</p><p>But wait, that doesn’t mean I can get gloomy.

Uh, the afternoon practice is held in a soundproof lesson room, right?</p><p>I have to be careful not to mistake the place~ This school gets renovated a lot, so the mapping is hard to grasp.</p><p>Even a Yumenosaki student like me would get lost sometimes.</p><p>How does it look compared to Reimei Academy?

But we came here for a raid, so why not put up a more villainous act?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Not a raid; we came here to work together in peace, y’know~?</p><p>‘Course since we’ll eventually become enemies, we can’t be getting too friendly… but this is where we should keep things civil, right?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “♪<sub>♪</sub>♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Oh? That orange-haired boy has disregarded everything and begun singing instead! That audacious personality might be clashing with mine?</p><p>I’ve seen that hair color somewhere.

Is my hair weird?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “No? I think it’s nice and charming!

That it wasn’t mere coincidence, but fate!</p><p>If you fail that, I’ll cast you aside and leave at this moment!

Come to think of it, we only had a short time to prepare for S1 and DDD during our revolution, as well.</p><p>Amidst that, we struggled to death, exerted every possible effort, and evolved. We’ve done the same this time too; I’m sure we can grow on a better direction.</p><p>…But is that really true? Aren’t we just carried away by our surroundings? I can’t stop pondering over all these doubts, but what lies beyond is an uncharted domain no one knows the right answer to.</p><p>It’s been a while since I’ve felt so uneasy. Really, when I look back on it, I can’t help thinking we might have took things too easy.</p><p>As if being chosen as representatives for SS makes us so great.</p><p>That’s not true. We’re still nowhere close to our goal. We can’t let the status quo satisfy us that we stop walking.</p><p>We must exert ourselves, deepen our friendship, and attain that victory without fail.)</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes! You must be mulling over superfluous things again!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…!? Tomoe-senpai, since when were you there?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/hxgLY7F.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I just arrived, you see? Still, that’s amazing, Hokuto-kun. I thought I was someone with relatively powerful presence, but you didn’t notice me coming at all!</p><p>Now, you were making a difficult face again, what were you thinking?</p><p>You know what they say: shoddy thinking may as well be worse than none at all! Ahaha♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It should be obvious—our joint lesson today will begin soon. I was determining the course of action I must take before it starts.</p><p>I can’t make a move without gathering my thoughts first</p><p>I’m Trickstar’s leader. I must be able to see the entirety of things.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I can agree to that. If the one who stands at the top were to falter, that’ll leave those below him in disarray.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You are always so quick to speak about standing.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “You don’t like it? Hierarchy is important, though. Humanity is just one type of animal that lives in packs, after all.</p><p>Somewhere, at the instinctual core of our being, we seek to abide by a strong and righteous God.</p><p>Extraordinary efforts are needed to defy such instinct.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Are you trying to say that you’re—that Eve is—such supreme existence?</p><p>You gave us many ‘instructions’, didn’t you? Like you’re so great…</p><p>You did that when we met face-to-face for the first time that day—to all of us. Like you’re somehow above us even though we’re supposed to be equals as work partners.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ahaha. You don’t have to obey me if you don’t like it. But things will definitely go well if you do as I say.</p><p>While it wasn’t like I did <em>everything</em>, I was indeed a member of <em>fine</em> who once reformed Yumenosaki Academy.</p><p>Even for just a split moment, I stood at the top of this miniature garden.</p><p>You should take your predecessor’s advice to mind, Hokke Mask-kun♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Don’t call me by that name.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Why? You looked far more animated that day, atop that stage, wearing a mask on you.</p><p>At your root, you’re… the submissive type of human. Rebellious phase doesn’t suit you.</p><p>Hidaka-sensei was worried about you. It feels disquieting looking at what you do, he said.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “My father has nothing to do with this. It’s my life. I don’t like strangers meddling with it.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Me aside, I don’t agree to calling your own father a stranger.</p><p>You were born to outstanding parents, so what’s so bad about taking advantage of the chance~? It’s enough cause for envy, really.</p><p>Ah well. We’re passing strangers, and we’ll be saying farewell at the end of summer.</p><p>But while you’re still in my line of sight—since you’ve been allowed to stand on the same stage…</p><p>I think you should try to absorb all sorts of things from us.</p><p>You’re a thoroughbred of the entertainment world; all the components you need have always existed in your blood. You shouldn’t shy from it; bring out that potential.</p><p>First, you should learn skills as I ‘instructed’ you to! It’s needed for Summer Live, so it’s a matter of urgency for you!</p><p>Let me see the product of that! I’ll pick at your flaws to kill time until the others gather♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…I accept. Prepare to be struck with wonder, Tomoe-senpai.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/sxsVBYi.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “……☆”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “……What’s with the delightful pose?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Wasn’t this your ‘instruction’? I have a downcast appearance compared to everyone else, so I should balance it out by being bolder, right?</p><p>I took that advice to heart and practiced it. How does my idol pose look?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Right… Looking closely, it’s not so bad, but I’ll subtract some points since you still look sheepish.</p><p>And your sense of timing was horrible. You startled me by making that funny pose with no forewarning.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I see. It was no good?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Oh no, it was fine. I acknowledge your effort… Continue your endeavors.”</p><p>(Hm~m… Just like Hidaka-sensei said: what an unrewarding kid to teach.</p><p>He possesses the capacity to accomplish anything, so why does he end up with such an absurd comprehension of what was taught?</p><p>How artless… No, perhaps this boy’s capacity is so massive…</p><p>That his entirety remains unobservable, and we can only pick up the visible components and judge from that… which makes him hard to be assessed with precision. That’s what this feels like.</p><p>Either way, if he could manifest the skill I ‘instructed’ him to until Summer Live, it should be enough.</p><p>I hope he makes it in time. …Well, at this heat, ice would melt in no time.)</p><h2 id="cheers">Cheers</h2><h3 id="cheers-1">Cheers 1</h3><p>&gt; <strong>Summer Live Stage</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/wOzgc0f.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yahoo yahoo yahoo☆</p><p>Today’s finally the day of the Summer Live we’ve been waiting for!

Subaru-kun is still young, so shouldn’t he be fine?</p><p>Instead, <em>we</em> should be careful not to be influenced by his enthusiasm and get ourselves too excited… Jun-kun♪</p><p>You’re still bad at pacing yourself, after all! You greenhorn! Ahahahaha☆”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “How come that you look the most animated when you’re putting other people down… Ohii-san~?</p><p>Geez, with Akehoshi-san here, the two of you together are even more grating.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes, being full of energy is a good thing!</p><p>Listening to his story, he seems to be shouldering a rather heavy past—that he can smile so innocently in spite of that, is it because he’s strong or just dense?</p><p>Well, that doesn’t matter! Other people can do whatever, but we’ll follow our own rules… We will simply perform elegantly, like we always do!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eeh~ Don’t be so distant! We’re here as comrades today, so let’s harmonize our paces! Let’s do our best☆”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes! I’ve said this many times before, but you all should address me in polite language!</p><p>Even if we’re comrades, we’re not equals~ I’m higher in status <em>and</em> older in age than you, so you should act meek towards me, okay?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha! You’re still talking about boring things like status, even though we’ve practiced together like buddies for a whole week?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “For <em>just</em> a week—right? It isn’t good to delude yourself with the thought that you understand the person you spent such a short time with!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Right, practice is practice, after all! Maybe if we can succeed together on the real deal, we’ll be even closer?”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> (Hnn~… Akehoshi-san’s awesome. He’s conversing with Ohii-san normally~ Like, what they’re saying properly mesh.</p><p>On the surface, Ohii-san is acting insulting like always, but he seems to be having fun under that.</p><p>He’d often reject job offers he doesn’t like or cancel on the last minute.</p><p>But it seems he’s planning to see Summer Live through to the end.</p><p>Well, I’ve got no complaint if he’s willing to do his job properly, but it doesn’t feel like you, you know… Ohii-san?)</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Hmm? What’s wrong? I’d like that you refrain from staring at me! My face shouldn’t be anything new to you after all this time, right, Jun-kun?</p><p>Ah, don’t tell me! Does seeing me act relatively intimate with Trickstar members concern you?</p><p>When we work for Eden and stuff, you’d have a sullen look on you when seeing my closeness with Nagisa-kun, don’t you~… Jun-kun♪</p><p>Ahaha, so you’re jealous!</p><p>Don’t worry, don’t worry! As Eve, <em>you</em>’re my partner, Jun-kun! Of course, if you turn out to be useless, I’ll quickly switch you for another kid!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “…I have a lot to retort, but… you <em>do</em> realize you’re not being yourself, right?</p><p>Aren’t you being strangely excited? What, did your heartstrings got tugged by Trickstar? Did you get lost in the fun of playing friends?</p><p>You understand what we’re here for, right?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Of course! Rather, the fact I’ll have to take on an undesirable role hereon makes me so uneasy—that I’m simply running away from reality by acting like a drunk!</p><p>Honestly, Eichi-kun asks the most troublesome favors…</p><p>Perform with everything you have as if to crush Trickstar, he said.</p><p>Unlike Eichi-kun, I don’t make it a hobby to bully the weak, you know?</p><p>If I were to crush insects underfoot as I walk, my impeccable attire will be sullied! A foul weather…!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Kicking others down to no end, isn’t that the reality of the deceitful idol industry?</p><p>I’ve decided my resolve a long time ago, y’know~ On the day I enrolled to Reimei Academy.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes! To be unmindful of diving into mud is the nature of hyena—that drive to improve is one of your few strengths!</p><p>I might not dislike the thought of learning from your example on that point… Jun-kun♪</p><p>Fufu. To be honest, just spending a mere one week together… has turned me quite fond of Trickstar.</p><p>All four of them have their unique shine, their own radiant talent; they’re such adorable and fascinating children.</p><p>But that’s why… this spotlight is not for Eden, for <em>fine</em>, nor for Adam—it’s for us Eve.</p><p>Those other groups might <em>just</em> accidentally find themselves destroying those sparkling ores, but…</p><p>We’ll polish them gently as if to comfort them, and make them shine to the utmost under the summer sun♪</p><p>If the number of excellent idols increase, the concept of idols will achieve a great rise in its value!</p><p>In other words, it benefits me! My policy is to nurture anything that’s worth nurturing, even if they’re enemies!”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Okay, okay. Well, we’re soft compared to those two from Adam…</p><p>Let’s defeat them <em>gently</em>, in a way that won’t kill them.</p><p>My condolences, gentlemen of Trickstar. Maybe you were beside yourself with joy just by being able to participate in SS, but life isn’t so easy.</p><p>I’m pretty fond of you guys, too.</p><p>At least we’ll rock you in our arms and comfort you, like a mother~…♪”</p><h3 id="cheers-2">Cheers 2</h3><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/qAi8OSA.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ooi, Eve! Sorry to interrupt when you’re having fun talking between yourselves, but we should do a rehearsal before the event starts.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes.

What’s wrong, Yuuki? You don’t look well. It’s a little too early to be getting heatstroke, right?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, no, I’m okay… Actually, I’ve been doing really well lately♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Your <em>‘I’m okay’</em> is too often surprisingly untrustworthy, you know… Does something about this affair disturb you? You’re making that kind of face.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, no… I’m okay. I think it’s just my imagination.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…? You’re always so withdrawn—never saying what you think.</p><p>We’re comrades, aren’t we? If something comes to mind, you should feel free to tell us about it.</p><p>It’s right before the show. While changing up the performance somewhere would be impossible…</p><p>We can probably modify the little details. I’ll do everything in my power, so tell me.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. You’re so serious, Hidaka-kun… Your expression has gotten stiff; are you nervous?</p><p>All right, let me reveal my special joke here to make you laugh♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Guys, stop the chatter and let’s rehearse. We have guests from another school here, so be good boys.</p><p>You’ll shame Yumenosaki Academy if you play around like always.</p><p>Our work partners are doing things properly, you know? Look at those two slipping into work mode…</p><p>We need to follow their example on that aspect.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “~……☆”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, you’re right. Ohii-san’s waving his hand to the fans who have gathered. He’s like a gentle-looking beauty if he’s quiet, isn’t he?</p><p>It seems he’s fully into his work mode: his aura utterly changed! That’s amusing~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Should you really be <em>amused</em>? We won’t be giving a good impression by whispering among ourselves like this.</p><p>At least let’s mingle with Eve.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “That’s true. Ooi, Sazanami-kun! Come over here♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Please don’t call out to me like you’re summoning a dog… We’re going to rehearse, right? I’ll do some warmups, so please wait.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, let’s do it together. One, two, three, four♪</p><p>You’re pretty well-built, aren’t you, Sazanami-kun? You’re like the action stars that appear in kung fu movies♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “What’s with the comparison…? Nothing to lose from building muscles, right? Though actually I’ve been gaining too much it slows me down, so I’m keeping it in moderation lately.</p><p>When you gain muscles, not only your body weight increase, you’re limiting your range of motion.</p><p>Also, Ohii-san hates muscles so… he’d be all like <em>‘You’re so sweaty!’</em> to me.</p><p>We’re not girls, there’s limit to looking soft and elastic when putting on fat.</p><p>So I think it’s preferable to build muscles. Ohii-san’s all squashy, y’know? His belly, for one.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Jun-kun, Jun-kun! Aren’t you spreading information that might smear my honor?</p><p>Remember that I can sue you! My family might have fallen, but we’re capable of employing groups of private lawyers, no problem!</p><p>Well, whatever! There’s really no time, so let’s quickly get the rehearsal done and over with! I’ll be taking charge, is that okay? I don’t care for objections♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Talk about controlling… Well, I’m still inexperienced as a leader, so I’ll leave it to you. In fact, I’ll be learning from you.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes! Learn all you want and be good boys, Trickstar♪</p><p>Then let’s get into the devised positions! Subaru-kun, Mao-kun, come over here! Hokuto-kun and Makoto-kun should go to Jun-kun!</p><p>We’ll be performing in groups of three.</p><p>Well, we decided on this together and practiced according to it, so there’s no need to explain it all over again, I suppose.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hmm~ Trickstar and Eve merging together, huh.</p><p>I think it’s easier for me to have Trickstar and Eve move separately, though.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I wish you wouldn’t bring up that argument again. Our numbers differ; it doesn’t look beautiful for a group of four and another of two to perform separately.</p><p>Considering each of our abilities and looks, as well as the songs we’ll perform in Summer Live and the audience that will gather… this positioning is, to my conclusion, the most efficient answer.</p><p>Well, just take my word for now and do as I say.</p><p>Your solidarity is enviable, but I think it’s refreshing to see you acting in separate groups for once.</p><p>Even separated, you’re still atop the same stage, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “True enough. If it means looking balanced, then I really welcome the plan. I mean, it’s <em>me</em> who always has to take great pains to keep these guys from running off to different directions as they like.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That’s how you truly feel, Isara? I’m sorry for giving you a tough time. Reflect on it, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh~!? Why do you say that as if I’m the insensitive one here?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> (Hmm~… Maybe it’s in my head, after all. Trickstar is acting normal, right?</p><p>For some reason, this Summer Live… Actually, ever since we started spending time with Eve, I’ve got this weird feeling.</p><p>Is it just because this is the first time we’ve had to work with another school?</p><p>I thought even if unbalanced, to make the most out of it… to pull through together to the end is Trickstar’s strength.</p><p>I feel like that ‘asset’ is being trampled on under the pretense of pretty words.</p><p>I hope I’m worried over nothing.)</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “?

But a human who achieves idolization in spite of being a non-deity, a mortal—is much more exceptional, miraculous, and beautiful!</p><p>Idols! Aah, how precious…☆</p><p>I’m glad there are more idols like me, more idols I can approve of!</p><p>There was meaning in leaving that tranquil paradise to drop by here! Ahaha♪</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/YaZpbAX.jpg"></p><p>It’s such a hot day it’s giving me a migraine, even so— &lt;I’m fine thank you&gt;…☆</p><h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2><h3 id="epilogue-1">Epilogue 1</h3><p>&gt; <strong>In front of the station</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/HZG80ZC.jpg"></p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Thanks for the hard work, everyone!”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Thank you too~! So you Eve are going home right after the Summer Live ended; that’s a pity!</p><p>I wanted to keep singing together forever~☆”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Haha. We’re happy you feel that way, but we have our own business to deal with, y’see.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/qo52387.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes! Unlike you guys, we sell! It feels pleasant to be yearned for, but we must part for a while.</p><p>Either way, good work to you! It was pretty fun~ Let’s do that again sometimes♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Gladly. Ah, we’ll see you to the turnstile. We’ll carry your stuffs too—or maybe we can arrange them to be sent to Reimei Academy on a later date, if you want.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You have mountains of luggage, after all! Ahaha☆ Ohii-san, what is it you bought so much of?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “I bought <em>everything</em> that caught my eye, of course! Ah, those were some satisfying purchases!</p><p>Look at this, Subaru-kun! Toys made in German are so colorful, aren’t they~♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Wow, you’re right, it’s so sparkling~☆ Give that to me, Ohii-san!”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Eh~ You should find one for yourself and buy it on your own choice.</p><p>I can give it to you as a present to deepen our friendship, but the joint live is over anyway… From here on, we’re completely enemies.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “But we’ll still be fellow idols! Let’s get along, Ohii-san! You too, Jun-Jun☆”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Huh…? Can you please not attach a weird nickname to me~?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes, you should learn from Jun-kun’s naming sense!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Why are those guys so full of energy even though we’re just finished with work?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. Akehoshi-kun’s always like that, so I’m no longer surprised, but the Eve members are still in high spirits too, huh…</p><p>It wasn’t like they were cutting corners either, so I guess they’re just cut from different cloth…</p><p>I need to work out more.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. Up for another hellish training from the Light Music Club, Yuuki?</p><p>We experienced a total defeat this time. I’ve got a taste of my own incompetence… Be it in business strategy or performance or everything else—we failed to even reach Eve’s ankles.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. So I was right; you’re upset, Hidaka-kun.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Obviously. If Eve alone is <em>this</em> strong, then just how formidable would they be when combined with that Adam group to become Eden…?</p><p>Just the thought makes my blood run cold.</p><p>There’s only half a year until SS. If we don’t work to the bones to grow, we won’t make it in time.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. That’s true. Give it your best shot♪”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/NJw5lYp.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…President. Please forgive us; the Summer Live ended with disgraceful results.</p><p>As Yumenosaki Academy’s representative, we’re very ashamed of ourselves.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Ahaha. Well done, but there’s no need to take a formal tone with me this late.</p><p>You guys seem to think you’ve lost… but it was a joint live, and as a plan, it laudably accomplished its purpose.</p><p>You weren’t deprived of anything. So without wasting time on weeping, keep working hard, optimistic like you are. I’m cheering for you from the bottom of my heart.</p><p>Of course, I’m not the only one. The whole Yumenosaki population is right behind you.</p><p>You guys tend to crowd on your own, Trickstar, but you should take a look at your surroundings.</p><p>Idols aren’t born through just idols.</p><p>Naturally, there are fans; but it’s also thanks to the effort of other staffs, like the producer, that you can finally shine.</p><p>Understanding that, Eve designed the most effective strategy to fight in an enemy territory.</p><p>They set up an encampment, won over their enemy, took them in, and attained impressive victory at the end. All things you didn’t even thought of.</p><p>However, while Eden might be the most prominent… the other units gathered for SS are also equal to Eve, if not greater.</p><p>As you are now, you’ll be crushed in a blink of eye.</p><p>In order to win—so that you won’t have to, for the second time, lower your head and say <em>‘forgive us’</em> to me, who you detest—…</p><p>Grow stronger, Trickstar.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ahaha. Eichi-kun, unexpectedly enough, you can say some really student council president-like things♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “…Are you dissatisfied that I do, Hiyori-kun?”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Not really? I’m glad to see you’re enjoying your life, Eichi-kun.</p><p>It’s good to see you after a long while… If circumstances permit, feel free to call me over.</p><p>I’ll come and drop by if I feel like it.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Of course. May you survive your fight and grant your dream.</p><p>You can consult me if you run into trouble. I’ll be happy to help… with proper payment, that is.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “What a joke. My family will contempt me for getting along with someone from the Tenshouin Zaibatsu<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p><p>Until we’re dead, we still haven’t lost; so make sure not to let your guard down.</p><p>Myself aside, my brother is an outstanding man. He’ll definitely rejuvenate the Tomoe Foundation.</p><p>To help achieve that, I need to become a better idol and promote our foundation more.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. You’re such a family person. Maybe I should learn from your example, on that point.</p><p>But be careful not to push yourself too much and fall ill, okay? This heat is going to continue for a while… You’re so bad at staying alive, I can’t help but worry.</p><p>Well, I’ll gladly keep you as pet again when you’re left on the streets, Hiyori-kun♪”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ahaha! If you’re still alive by the time such a day comes, I might take you up on the offer, Eichi-kun…♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Ohii-saaan, the train’s coming. Stop that discomforting chat and let’s get going.</p><p>…Once again, thank you for the good work today, everyone.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup, you too, Sazanami-kun. If it’s not a bother, can we connect through social media?</p><p>I want to trade intelligence for SS and be friends with you too.”</p><h3 id="epilogue-2">Epilogue 2</h3><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Ah… I know your account, Yuuki-san, so I’ll follow you first.</p><p>But be careful not to approach the other Eden members besides us two.</p><p>One of them likes to set up schemes that make use of the internet, y’see.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Ah, you mean Nagisa-kun’s companion. I hate how bleak and importunate he is, like a snake… Our strategy for Summer Live was partly his work, too.</p><p>Nagisa-kun himself is a calamitous man, so you should put up your guard.</p><p>Eichi-kun’s plan… is probably to pit Trickstar against Adam next, now that you’ve seen Eve.</p><p>But unlike us, Adam isn’t so gentle.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Thank you for the warning. However, we’re set to collide in SS anyway, so we can’t avoid them forever.</p><p>We’ll become stronger so we won’t get crushed.</p><p>Let’s meet again in SS, Eve.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Same to you, Trickstar… I’ll eagerly wait for our reunion. Do your best and survive.</p><p>Bye-bye, everyone. See you again…♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “’Scuse us, then.</p><p>…Ohii-san, carry some of your belongings yourself.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Yes yes! I refuse! Tell me, what were you born for? It was to carry my belongings, right?♪”</p><p><strong>Jun:</strong> “Uwaah… I thought he might’ve fixed some of that personality through befriending nice folks like Trickstar…</p><p>But not even a little bit? Just drop dead already.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “…Ahaha. They’re gone. It feels a little lonely, somehow.</p><p>We spent a week together. It’s not so strange that affections would well up, I guess.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yep. But anyway, we’re gonna have to face them in SS, so it’s probably better to not get <em>too</em> friendly, for the sake of the fight too.</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/fxd6ScX.jpg"></p><p>…Oh hey, Anzu!</p><p>Why are you so far apart? Come over here. You watched our Summer Live, didn’t you? Thanks for coming.</p><p>…Though we might’ve given you a pathetic show this time.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Right, there are too many things to reflect on. It ended with Eve completely squashing us that we failed to bring out our strengths.</p><p>They didn’t give us room to do anything—that’s what it feels like.</p><p>Good that it was a joint live, but if it had been a match, it would have counted as a tragic defeat.</p><p>If you guys still have some energy left, let’s hold an afterparty while reviewing our mistakes.</p><p>If it’s fine with you, I’d like you to participate, Anzu. We’ll be happy to hear your frank opinion as a producer.</p><p>…What’s wrong, Anzu? You don’t look good. Is it heatstroke?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha! Then you should hug Hokke, Anzu! He has low body temperature, so he’s nice and chilly to touch during summertime♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t cling to me, Akehoshi. It’s hot… You’re being too cheerful, even compared to usual. Are you depressed over our overwhelming defeat, too?</p><p>Faking cheerfulness is unbecoming, but I don’t suppose we can keep looking upset, either. Let’s switch up our gears—our experience today will become the sustenance that makes us even stronger.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah. And if possible, let’s work together next time, Anzu-chan.</p><p>It seems we weren’t in luck to have you this time, but it’s when you’re with us that Trickstar can really shine.</p><p>I know you must be busy taking care of other units too…</p><p>But we’re always hoping for you to produce us, Anzu-chan. No matter when.</p><p>…Throughout Summer Live, you had the look of someone who was watching a public execution.</p><p>We really need to reflect on the fact we put that look on your face.</p><p>We’ll get stronger, promise. In SS, we’ll show you a great performance that’ll bring out your brightest smile.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Anzu, let me see that notebook. You were fervently writing on it throughout Summer Live, weren’t you?</p><p>Hmm. So you also reviewed the stage upon Sakuma-senpai’s urging, huh. You jotted down every conceivable point to be improved on and every imaginable way to produce us?</p><p>I see. You’re planning to produce for us assertively next time… That makes me very happy, I can’t ask for more.</p><p>You’re always welcome among us. Let’s get stronger together, Anzu.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Anzu~ The drafts here are design ideas, right? Are they the costumes for Summer Live?</p><p>We had to wear the outfits Eve prepared this time, so you thought up how our costumes would look if you’d designed them?</p><p>Ahaha! Your version feels a lot more like us☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ah, hey, don’t hide them. Let me see. …Wow, you really understand us best, Anzu♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> (Fufu. You guys really are close. That’s your biggest strength.</p><p>It was something we—the protagonists of the past Yumenosaki, the <em>fine</em> of olden days—lacked.</p><p>How enviable… No, it’s because you’re that sort of children that I want to see you win. I want to see you overturn this world ruled by unfeeling numbers, and show me a miracle once more.)</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “President~ We’re gonna do an after party. Would you like to join?”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I’ll pass. It’s been so hot today, so I’ll go home and rest.</p><p>I need to make the necessary arrangements for your next ordeals, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…Try to go easy on us, President.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Oh no, I won’t be nice. I’ll kick you off the cliff again and throw one bomb after another at you.</p><p>I believe that you can survive that and weave for us an unpredictable tale.</p><p>You did well today, Trickstar. But for better or worse, your fight has only just begun…♪”</p><p>~<em>(Edit) Extra things of note.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup></p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Daikichi’s name means excellent luck, great blessing, etc. It’s the best fortune slip you can get in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-mikuji" target="_blank" rel="noopener">omikuji</a>; you might have pulled it in the game’s 2017 New Year campaign.
