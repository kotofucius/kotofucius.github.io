Academy</strong></p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/bMpBQ1C.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Here we are~!</p><p>So this is the rumored Chuuetsu… Shuuitsu?–no, Shuuetsu Academy, huh!☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “At least remember their name, Akehoshi.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Well, but we’ve been in a lot of interschool matches lately.</p><p>New schools just keep coming and I can’t keep up with all of them. And Shuuetsu’s surprisingly normal-sounding, you know.</p><p>I wish they’d have a more ominous name, like some evil organization! Genocide Academy, for example…☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “They may be enemy to us, but that doesn’t mean they’re evil.</p><p>We’re in their territory already. You don’t know who may be listening in, so keep both the volume of your voice <em>and</em> the content of your speech friendly.</p><p>Since we’re on the receiving side of their cordiality, we should be good and obedient.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yes yes, understood~♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. But there’s no helping feeling aggressive, right? I mean, this is where Adam goes to.</p><p>They’re like the brother unit to Eve, who pummeled us to the ground in Summer Live…</p><p>So it’s kind of unnerving.</p><p>I’d like to think we’ve grown through our hard work since then, but we were completely powerless against Eve in Summer Live.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. And Adam is definitely no weaker than Eve. I think we can’t avoid a struggle.</p><p>But hey, it’s still not SS, anyway.</p><p>Doesn’t matter that we lose; let’s just give it everything in our power.</p><p>It could serve as a good measure to see how far we’ve grown since that face-off with Eve.</p><p>And should we happen to win, that could become a revenge for how Summer Live turned out. Would be a nice motivation for SS at the end of the year. Though of course… we’re aiming for the win.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. It seems you guys are all motivated enough. I’m glad.</p><p>…Are you alright, though, Anzu? You seem to be constantly worn out recently.</p><p>We can greet our work partners by ourselves, if you want. You should have a nice rest at the hotel to heal the fatigue from the long journey.</p><p>The live itself is still a week from now, so forcing yourself too much from the get-go, only to be too tired for the real deal would be getting your priorities wrong.</p><p>If it gets too much, don’t push yourself further and just rest, Anzu.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha! Come to think of it, we’re all staying at a hotel for the week, aren’t we! It’s like a field trip♪</p><p>They said they prepared fancy rooms for us, so I’m looking forward to it!</p><p>Though we’ve had many interschool matches lately, this is the first we’re staying over for such a long period, isn’t it?</p><p>I’m excited~ Hey, let’s gather at night for pillow wars or poker☆”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ahaha. We’re here for a job, so we should reserve our energy. Rest at night, will ya? Getting proper sleep is also part of the job.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. We already had our fill sightseeing during the school field trip, anyway.</p><p>If necessary, we can prolong our stay and relax for a few days after the job.</p><p>In any case, we should only focus on the job in front of us for now.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “‘Kaay. if that’s decided, I wanna greet Adam quick. Can we enter the school grounds already?</p><p>From what I can see, there’s no one around and it’s dead silent… Maybe they’re on break?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It <em>is</em> Sunday, but you’re right that there’s not even a shadow. Yumenosaki is lively even during weekends, though.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Fufu. And there’s an increase on DreamFests lately, so even the weekends are festive.</p><p>Umm, from my prior research…</p><p>There are no student committees in Shuuetsu, and clubs are inactive and exist pretty much only in name.</p><p>The agency creates schedules for them, so jobs… live concerts and such unofficial activities are apparently impossible. So well, I guess their weekends would turn out like this.</p><p>Shuuetsu’s population probably don’t even commute to school during weekends.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hmm~ Weekends sound uneventful without club activities. I wonder what they do, then? Play with friends?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Umm… Apparently, Shuuetsu Academy houses only the most excellent of students from the affiliated schools… called the Special Students.</p><p>Even their weekends are probably filled with work, like proper celebs, I think?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ooh, what a grey-colored youth… I mean, it’s a good thing if they sell, sure.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “A school for only the top elites, was the word, after all. They’re of a completely different world~ I mean, I guess they do form a better picture of idols.</p><p>In truth, idols’ individual schedules often don’t mesh due to work…</p><p>So Yumenosaki is probably the nonsensical one for making clubs compulsory for its students.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hmm~ Even though we’re just at different schools, it feels like different countries.</p><p>I’m starting to worry that we won’t be able to talk normally with Adam, who have been raised in such an environment. What to do, what if they address us in alien language?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “That’s part of the thrill of traveling, yeah? Well, they’re human beings like us, I’m sure we can come to an understanding through words.</p><p>Anyway, there’s no point loitering around the front gate… let’s come inside.</p><p>Anzu, you have our partners’ contact, right? For now, tell them that we’ve arrived.</p><p>Since there’s no escort in sight, I don’t think we’re very welcomed… but we’re here for a fight, too. This treatment feels <em>just right</em>, yeah?”</p><hr><h2 id="foreign-land">Foreign Land</h2><h3 id="foreign-land-1">Foreign Land 1</h3><p><strong>&gt; Shuuetsu Academy Corridor</strong></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Uwaah, it’s spectacularly empty of people inside the building too… Ooi, anybody around?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eeek, it’s like humanity vanished away due to some accident. Despite being a brand new building, without anyone around, it’s like a ruins…</p><p>It feels like we’re in the middle of a test of courage… we’re already past the season for ghost stories, though.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Let’s see. Apparently, if we continue down this path, we’ll find Adam’s personal parlor. Let’s head there, first of all.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “What’s a personal parlor? Not a concept I’ve heard…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm, so they have a parlor for their exclusive use? Perhaps Adam is considered a bigshot, even within Shuuetsu?</p><p>When Adam and Eve combine, they become Eden, which is indeed the top idol unit of our age group.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Mmn, from what I’ve gathered, it’s one of the privileges Special Students hold.</p><p>Parlors and practice rooms, or such facilities and utilities within and out of the school, can be gained the sole rights to.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “For real? Some extravagant grants there. We always have a tough time just reserving rooms to practice.</p><p>Using the school currency to pay and going through all that procedure to borrow a lesson room…</p><p>Special Students in Shuuetsu are excused of such troubles, huh?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup. Plus, the non-Special Students from the affiliated schools are the one to maintain and look after the facilities.</p><p>Special Students use their time only for idol activities.</p><p>Eve’s Sazanami-kun told me that those who aren’t Special Students are no different from slaves.</p><p>Probably Special Students enjoy a royalty-like livelihood.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Hmm, so that means they’d all thrive to earn the title of Special Students, huh?</p><p>I guess that kind of class system is also one valid method…</p><p>…but since we emerged from the bottom of the chain too, it’s hard not to feel for those other students who get treated like slaves.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Still, we’re not here to reform Shuuetsu Academy’s ways. Even if some parts can be offending, we should refrain from criticizing them.</p><p>It is out of line for outsiders to denounce their ways as ‘weird’ or ‘abnormal’.</p><p>Students of Shuuetsu and Reimei enrolled here, agreeing to such a system.</p><p>If we win SS… perhaps Shuuetsu would realize the flaws in their methods, and rethink things through.</p><p>Until then, however, whatever we say would sound like nothing but an attack.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “If you ask me whether Yumenosaki does things 100% right, I’d cock my head to the side, too.</p><p>Some never do get used to its competitive society that’s based around the DreamFest system.</p><p>…Picking at the laws and stuff like this is probably a waste of time.</p><p>Adapting to the environment with an open mind and practicing to our hardest would be of more benefit, I guess.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. I suppose because we gathered and formed for the sake of revolution, we can’t help but concern ourselves with the mechanism of things.</p><p>Perhaps that’s somewhat crude, as idols.</p><p>To sing, dance, and make someone happy – that’s the sort of existence we should purely strive to be.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/CZoo7ey.jpg"></p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ooi~ Trickstar~♪”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Uwaah, that surprised me!? Oh hey, it’s Blue-senpai! What are you doing here?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Mmn, didn’t you hear?</p><p>It’s a job outside the school, so some of us from Yumenosaki, including supervising teachers, have been dispatched to be your support.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, come to think of it, a teacher will always tag along when we work outside the school, huh? Nuginugi-sensei supervised us for Starmine, too.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Kunugi-sensei will get angry if you call him ‘Nuginugi-sensei’…</p><p>Normally, only one teacher would supervise us, but you’ll be with us this time around, Aoba-senpai?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “That’s right~ It was Adam’s… or rather, Shuuetsu Academy’s proposition, that we can have as many willing students as we want to accompany you.</p><p>Apparently, the live next week might be of larger scale than expected.</p><p>Our school needs as many staffs on the scene as they can, and help was even enlisted through on-campus part time.</p><p>Adam’s Nagisa-kun and I are close as former <em>fine</em> members, see.</p><p>Plus, Trickstar did a lot for us during the Star Spirit Festival and stuff… I thought I’d go, if I can be of some use.</p><p>Of course, I’ll keep a low profile as to not trouble you. I’ll support you in any way I can, so please feel free to rely on me for anything.</p><p>Fushimi-kun of the current <em>fine</em>, too, has supposedly been tasked by Eichi-kun to come along.</p><p>He will apparently care for your livelihood during the stay.</p><p>Fushimi-kun should be managing your luggages in the inn you’ll be staying, as we speak.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Oh, so Yuzuru came too. Just him?</p><p>Pretty rare that he’s on a task without Himemiya… Well, there’s probably no rejecting the President’s plea, I guess.</p><p>Also – excuse me, but did you just say ‘inn’? I thought we’re supposed to be staying at a hotel? Is it just a figure of speech…?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ah… For some reason, Fushimi-kun was really against the idea, and moved your lodging destination to the inn that Eichi-kun’s family manages.</p><p>You didn’t hear about that, too?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. There are lots of changes, for some reason. What’s going on? Is the student council president up to no good, again?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Ahaha. Eichi-kun’s been completely fitted into the image of a schemer, huh…</p><p>Since you’ll be up against Adam, I think there’ll be no end to it if you even put up your guard against Eichi-kun…</p><p>But still; you guys are the main actors, so feel free to act as you see fit.</p><p>Please show us a splendid miracle unique to you this time too… Trickstar♪”</p><h3 id="foreign-land-2">Foreign Land 2</h3><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “So anyway; what kind of event is it supposed to be?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? Blue-senpai, did you join for the ride without looking into the details?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “No, no. I did give the proposal a proper read first.</p><p>But the content of the proposal contradicted what I gathered from my personal exchange with Nagisa-kun.</p><p>On you Trickstar’s side… or more like, Anzu-chan’s proposal shapes it to be <em>Revenge for Summer Live!</em> and all…</p><p>Even the title of the proposal says <em>Revenge Match!</em>, and I was surprised at how psyched Anzu-chan was.</p><p>It felt more forthright… or even aggressive compared to her usual proposals.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. That’s how much of a bitter experience Summer Live was for Anzu, not just us…</p><p>I think it was both a turning point, and a tragedy we don’t wish to repeat.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It was a necessary experience. We have worked hard since our loss in Summer Live, taking it in as our nourishment.</p><p>So we wish to ascertain what we’ve gained since then, while measuring the difference between our abilities and Eden’s.</p><p>We have attended many interschool matches since then and produced results on our own right, but…</p><p>While I believe we have not grown into defeatists, Eden remains our greatest archenemy.</p><p>We wish to see what we are worth and prepare for SS, through this fight against Adam.</p><p>Since SS is at the end of year, we can still afford to adjust our direction with the little time left, should we find faults to fix, or points to improve.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. Hokke, you’ve somehow adopted a polite tone when speaking to Blue-senpai♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “He’s an upperclassman. The more I know him, the more I begin to think that there are sides of him worthy of respect.</p><p>For some reason, I can never bring myself to mind my manners towards the student council president or my club president, though…</p><p>Is it because they show more disdainful sides than respectable ones?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “This boy just said something savage with a straight face…</p><p>Fufu. You’re free to make fun of me, but this job is out of the school.</p><p>So please try to use polite language, as is proper, when you talk to Adam.</p><p>We’re in enemy territory, after all. And Adam is the boss here, so you won’t be making a good impression by acting rude.</p><p>Inciting hostility from the masters of the house is a horrible thing, you know~ It can be a thorn on your side.</p><p>Well, Nagisa-kun probably doesn’t mind, though. He’s a genius on the likes of Hiyori-kun, yet he doesn’t seem to hold much interest for societal norms.</p><p>If you leave him be, he’ll be off doing some bizarre thing all day long, so he’s a slippery child, in a sense.</p><p>If Hiyori-kun is like a noble, then Nagisa-kun is like an animal…</p><p>No, a monster.</p><p>I’d say he has a mentality closer to the Five Oddballs, rather than <em>fine</em>, in that they don’t follow the norms of human society, but remain needlessly powerful in spite of it.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh~ I wonder what he’s like? If he’s anything like the Five Oddballs, I think we can get along. I’m looking forward to see him~!</p><p>Today’s our scheduled first meeting, so I haven’t even spoken to him!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah, even within Adam, this Ran Nagisa person seems particularly secretive, or rather…</p><p>There’s not much reliable information on him released to the public, so I can’t grasp him.</p><p>Even his interviews sound like they’re scripted, and his social media accounts read like they’re ghostwritten…</p><p>It’s just what I feel though; I have no base for it.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Oi, oi. Don’t start forming prejudices on your head before you even meet the guy.</p><p>That sort of thing is visible, y’know? We’ve got to approach them with courtesy as work partners and show deference.</p><p>We’re guests this time, so we should refrain from simply storming as we please.</p><p>Anyway, I’m informed on the topic since I’m in the stuco.</p><p>There were quite lots of twists and turns before the proposal was finalized, see~ Seemed like it was given quite the overhaul.</p><p>It feels the content has changed a lot from what Anzu’s proposal originally meant to do.</p><p>At first, like what its title–<em>Revenge Match!</em>–implies, it was supposed to be a rematch with Eve, that we lost to in summer, y’know?</p><p>Like, <em>defeating our archenemy to advance forward</em>, kind of thing.</p><p>But there was some kind of political meddling and all, and somehow it’s decided we’ll fight against Adam, who’s Eve’s equal, instead.</p><p>They’re going to show up in SS as Eden anyway…</p><p>So I understand that we’ll have to face Adam eventually, not just Eve, but still.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. Eve and Adam combine to become Eden, right?</p><p>If we only know Eve, it means we haven’t seen more than half of their original shape, so I think a face-off against Adam is necessary.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Hnn~ From what I’ve read of the renewed proposal, whether it’s really a face-off or not is kind of up in the air too.</p><p>I sure hope we can have a straight-up one-on-one with Adam like we did Eve.”</p><h3 id="foreign-land-3">Foreign Land 3</h3><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Apparently, there’s going to be this thing called Autumn Live next week, in which idols of Shuuetsu and other affiliated schools will gather.</p><p>Trickstar will participate as a guest star there, is how the whole deal ends.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, by affiliated schools, does that mean Reimei…Eve will show up too?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Who knows? Depends on their schedule.</p><p>They’re in demand. I predict them to be busy, having more exposure on TV and other medias compared to Adam.</p><p>Anyway, this means we’re jumping into their large-scale event, much like Yumenosaki’s S1.</p><p>I don’t think it’s going to be a proper one-on-one.</p><p>Even in SS, there’s going to be idols from all over the country, so it can be a good practice…</p><p>…on how to act among many unknown people, I guess.</p><p>But it’s hard to say, if it can be the revenge Anzu greatly intended it to be.</p><p>I know it’s not all gonna be fruitless, but I’m still concerned over that part.</p><p>I didn’t exactly believe <em>everything</em> can line up with our interests or go as we wish it to be, y’know…</p><p>But somehow, it feels like we’re dancing on top of someone’s palm.</p><p>From what I’ve observed of his conduct in the student council, I think President’s not really satisfied, either.</p><p>If it’s not part of his scheme, then who twisted the proposal, and for what sake?</p><p>I can’t put it well, but I’m getting creeps… Am I just being a worrywart? Whaddya guys think?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “First, I’m curious on how Adam members are like! Meeting impressive guys can be inspiring!

Didn’t they say we’ll have a meeting in the parlor?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “So we were told… Aoba-senpai, can’t you get in touch with that Nagisa you’re friends with?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Mnn, I’ve been trying, but he hasn’t picked up.</p><p>I wonder what’s wrong… he couldn’t have wandered off somewhere and got hit by a car, could he?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “No no, we’re not talking about a toddler here.</p><p>…Huh? I think I hear something vibrate. Guys, don’t one of you have a call incoming?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, isn’t it Anzu? Look, Anzu’s breast pocket is vibrating!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. Pick it up, Anzu. It could be someone from Shuuetsu; they might explain this strange situation to us.</p><p>From what I’ve heard, you’ve met the two Adam members and conversed with them a few times – isn’t that right?</p><p>The rest of us haven’t found the timing to meet them face-to-face.</p><p>Hmm… Uh-huh… So this Saegusa guy from Adam called to summon us to Reimei Academy’s courtyard?</p><p>Apparently, he set off to welcome and escort us, but we ended up missing each other?</p><p>I see… Returning to the path we came from sounds like unnecessary trouble, but let’s all go back to the courtyard anyway.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh~? Can’t we just wait here? The meeting’s gonna be in this parlor, right?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Just start moving. We’re at an unknown territory; we shouldn’t act individually.

Now we know where Aoba-senpai is, but where did Isara and Anzu disappear to?

Special Students do as they please, but those supporting from beneath work all year long, you see.</p><p>Quietly, in the shadows, as to not stand out.</p><p>Ah, but of course <em>all year long</em> is a figure of speech… In reality, they get proper rest through shifts, and their working abides by labor law.</p><p>In any case, since there is nothing particular to do while we wait, allow me to guide you for a tour.

Yumenosaki Academy has been restoring its reputation in recent years, but…</p><p>They have their hands too full to care for other affairs.</p><p>With training a lone producer as a test case, for one. Yumenosaki is falling behind a decade on these matters.</p><p>In any case. We students of Shuuetsu, Reimei, and other affiliate schools all, without exception, belong to an agency. We are trained and managed by them.</p><p>That agency is called Cosmic Production, shortened CosPro. But well, most of us usually just call it ‘the agency’.</p><p>Students of other schools can enter our agency as well, provided they go through the necessary procedures.</p><p>If Yumenosaki’s ways stop agreeing with you, do feel free to switch over to this side.</p><p>It should not contradict your school’s laws or its rules, yes?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yeah. While Yumenosaki does what an agency does for its students, we’re not affiliated with any actual agency on paper.</p><p>Among the people we know, there’s one like Narukami-kun who belongs to a modeling agency too.</p><p>Personally, entering an agency on top of the unit, club, and committee I belong to right now sounds like a huge deal and a tangle of personal connections.</p><p>And for now, we haven’t been disadvantaged in any way in our activities as idols by only being under Yumenosaki Academy’s wings.</p><p>When we work under an agency, we might have to do things that don’t suit our principles, so I’m not too fond of it…</p><p>Our current position is much more comfortable. It’ll tire me out if everything gets connected to work.</p><p>Of course, if that’s what the others wish, I won’t object. There’s wisdom to be gained from entering an agency, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. You once worked under an agency, didn’t you, Yuuki?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “During my child modeling days, yeah. It’s normal for idols and models; Yumenosaki students are the exceptions here.</p><p>Of course, there are those who work in small scale, either alone or centered around an amateur producer.</p><p>But entering a huge agency makes many things a lot easier.”</p><p><strong>Ibara:</strong> “Indeed. …Speaking of which, you have all been put under temporary contract with CosPro, just in case.</p><p>It’s only for the period of Autumn Live’s preparation…</p><p>…and as Special Students. The procedures will go smoother that way.</p><p>Of course, you are free to leave once Autumn Live is over.</p><p>These are your temporary licenses… proof that you now hold the position I just spoke of.</p><p>You will be fined if you lose it, so please, take care not to.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ooh… What’s this?

I didn’t want to work too hard and get myself sick either, since I’d just cause trouble that way.</p><p>The rest of Trickstar always overdo things. At least I’ve got to be the calm one, having my head on my shoulders and making the best choices…</p><p>Or we’ll all break to pieces mid-air.</p><p>Nah, that’s just my excuse… I’m always like this, leaving the important things for later and opting for the easy paths.</p><p>Slippery as an eel, I run away pretending it’s the smart thing to do.</p><p><em>He just hasn’t gotten serious.

I thought if I could show him what we’re capable of like with Eve, things can go well with Adam too, but…</p><p>It was no good… I think I even made them look down on the other Trickstar guys.

That was faster than I expected.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha, Barry kept hanging around me and that gave me the creeps, so I made a run for it.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. It’s rare to hear you express avoidance of other people, saying they give you the creeps and all. Don’t you love other people, as a general rule?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I love them! But for some reason, I don’t feel like we can come to an understanding with the two guys from Adam and befriend them, you know~?</p><p>I can’t find a good way to phrase this, but they feel really far away.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm… Well, we’ll have to face against them in SS, so there’s really no need to be friends.</p><p>Rather than that, you got the messages from Isara, right?</p><p>I deciphered it immediately, but… I still don’t understand what he wants. What do you think is his intention?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Eh, you decoded it already? That’s fast! I haven’t even managed to read half of it~”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Heh, I’m good at this kind of thing. I’m used to word puzzles through doing crosswords.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. You sure do love them, Hokke… You’ll even be solving crosswords when class is in session. Oi, focus on the lecture, class rep~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Well, it’s hard to settle down when there’s a grid to fill.</p><p>Fufu. Shuuetsu Academy is almost like a different country to us, so I’ve found it hard to relax, but…</p><p>When I talk with you, I think I restored some of our usual feel.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yeah. We’ve been kinda weird, huh.</p><p>I’m especially worried about Sally, who seems devastated by that Nagisa guy’s words, and also Ukki…</p><p>Ukki seems to be seriously considering about joining their agency.</p><p>He gathered a bunch of documents and had his face buried on them the whole time.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yuuki belonged to a modeling agency in the past, so he must have less resistance to the idea than we do.</p><p>In our case, the thought of our positions largely changing is too hard to swallow, but…</p><p>I’m actually finding the agency to be an attractive proposition too.</p><p>Saegusa definitely selected the information he disclosed to us well, so despite seeing many merits to signing up to the agency, I fail to see any demerit.</p><p>If they would then tell us to disband Trickstar as a condition to join, I would oppose without hesitation.</p><p>But it seems we can gain some flexibility with work content and standings, depending on how well we negotiate.</p><p>Just by attending Shuuetsu’s lessons a little, I felt the difference in quality compared to Yumenosaki’s.</p><p>I feel myself growing fast and my flaws being neutralized.</p><p>There were first-class lecturers, experts of their fields, who quickly resolved the technical concerns I had with certain expressions.</p><p>They grasped my strengths and weaknesses and arranged a method where I could grow better.</p><p>Livelihood is serviced perfectly and jobs are in no way suspicious — the agency chooses what’s the most beneficial and gives it to us.</p><p>We can focus everything into becoming more radiant idols.</p><p>…I don’t see anything to pick at. If the agency would look after the content of our work and lessons, then there’s no worry about colliding with others, as well.</p><p>It won’t be a contest; individuals will grow in ways unique to them.</p><p>We won’t have to kick others down.

It’s definitely a right that requires bloodbaths to earn.</p><p>We’ve been excused from that. We’re given only the merits.</p><p>We fought a desperate battle in DDD and raised as victors. We’ve acquired value as idols. That’s why we’re given the same privileges as Special Students.</p><p>But how was it in Yumenosaki? Did anything change?</p><p>We were bound to repeat battles to no end, on and on…</p><p>Didn’t the battle itself turned into purpose, hindering our growth as idols?</p><p>…I don’t know what’s right anymore.</p><p>Should we stay in Yumenosaki, stay as the ‘we, who were nobodies’, even to SS?</p><p>Shouldn’t we reform from the roots, and be reborn?</p><p>I think Yuuki is thinking of the same thing. He might seem like a fool sometimes, but he’s the wisest and most self-possessed of us all.</p><p>He knows how to calculate the merits and demerits of a decision in a concise fashion.

There was no room for Anzu to assert her opinion.</p><p>If we enter the agency, there’ll be no place for Anzu next to Trickstar.</p><p>And I’d really hate that to happen… I know, it’s a really personal and emotional reason.</p><p>Me, Hokke, Ukki, Sally, Anzu… We won DDD because the five of us were there. That’s how the miracle, the revolution happened.</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/nMGJCVj.jpg"></p><p>I don’t want there to cease to be five of us. I don’t want to lose anyone… Of course, I’m aware Anzu isn’t our exclusive producer.</p><p>She’s very much in demand among the other units, and they all want her. Even if we distance ourselves from her, she has many other places to belong.</p><p>And as a producer, she was an amateur until recently… The person the agency will assign us might be more competent.</p><p>Even so, Trickstar became what it is because it’s <em>us five</em>. If any one of us was missing, I’m sure the position we have now would greatly differ.</p><p>It’s because it’s the Trickstar we made together, that we’re given extravagant treatment like Special Students here in Shuuetsu.</p><p>So, I don’t want to cast anything away… as if we no longer have use for it, just because that’s the more beneficial choice.</p><p>I know you might get angry if I put things this way, Hokke.</p><p>You might say we’re not here to play around, that it’s work, that I shouldn’t say such selfish things…</p><p>That there’s no way around it. You’re strong, so you might be able to move forward, Hokke.</p><p>But that’s too much to ask from me. I can’t walk by myself.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Are you a baby?</p><p>…Well, I know what you’re trying to say.</p><p>We can’t decide in a heartbeat. Should we choose what’s profitable, or follow our hearts? And can we really win if we choose by heart? Become happy, become the idols we dreamed of?</p><p>Whether the world is that kind or not… I still don’t know either.</p><p>However, there’s little time to dwell on this. SS is nigh; it’s at the end of the year.</p><p>We have to move fast, or we won’t make it in time. We were given a choice at such a pressing time.</p><p>We can’t help but hesitate.</p><p>If there was only one goal, like <em>defeating the student council</em> or <em>reforming Yumenosaki</em>, we could’ve advanced without hesitation, but…</p><p>We wavered. …This must be part of Adam’s plan.</p><p>But we know this sort of plan by experience. Tomoe-senpai said the tactic in Summer Live was suggested to him by Adam, and they seem to be using a similar hand this time around.</p><p>If they think we’ll fall for the same trap twice, they’re looking down on us too much.</p><p>If we can read our opponent’s tactic, we can also build a counterattack. We can definitely take revenge this time, without things ending in our total defeat.</p><p>It seems Anzu and Isara are working to make that happen. That’s what the message we got said.</p><p>Last time might have been a one-sided massacre for the most part, but this one will be a proper battle. While they might’ve made the first strike, we can turn the tables on them from now.</p><p>Launching an attack means they’re prepared to be struck back. Let’s have our payback to our fill.</p><p>That’s what the <em>Revenge Match!</em>, as Anzu titled and planned, is for.</p><p>The war zone is endless, bitter, and unfamiliar… But we’ll survive, and give those guys, who are sitting back believing they’ve won, a good shock.</p><p>That’s what we are. …We’re Trickstar.”</p><h2 id="isolation">Isolation</h2><h3 id="isolation-1">Isolation 1</h3><p><strong>&gt; Autumn Live Stage (TS)</strong></p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “(humming)…♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Hmm?

It is no longer the era for monopoly, anyway; theirs is a democratic power, you could say.</p><p>Well, to look at it another way, though… Tenshouin Zaibatsu is beyond human logic in the way it manages to compete, alone, with such a complex forming of large powers.</p><p>The Himemiyas, whom I serve, are quite the powerful house as well, but the Tenshouin Zaibatsu is at a different level.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. That kind of financial?-world talk I don’t really get, but…</p><p>Seeing the venue, it does seem like many companies are sponsoring this. I saw advertisements here and there.”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Yes. If you cut off one of their heads, it will regrow.

I need to excuse myself for a while, Yuuki-sama.</p><p>Currently, I am working on the construction and cleanliness of the venue as one of the support members, but…</p><p>For some reason, the Shuuetsu members would not work on Trickstar’s stage.</p><p>Well, I suppose it is natural to prioritize the side one belongs to.</p><p>But while they have been currying favors with you as their guests, their real feelings are quite plain to see here.</p><p>We are having a tough time, as we are lacking in helping hands.

First of all, let me speak of Nagisa-kun’s personal history.</p><p>It’s going to sound like a conspiracy theory from the start, and I’m aware of how ridiculous it is, myself.</p><p>On the shadow of the entertainment industry, there was someone who used to be pulling all the strings… the most powerful man, something of a godfather of this business.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Godfather… Eh, that sounds like a movie.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Though it’s reality. He had such a large influence over the industry, like some god, and I heard he even dabbled in crime-like, illegal things.</p><p>The notorious lord of the industry, you may say.</p><p>While he lived quite the long life, he has passed away for a good while now.</p><p>During the postmortem investigation, it was found that he had been sheltering one beautiful boy behind closed doors.</p><p>And that’s Nagisa-kun.</p><p>When he was found, he was already around middle school age.</p><p>However, he was adorned in a fancy room like some doll, not receiving any proper education.</p><p>Like another treasure cherished and put on display by an evil boss… The reason Nagisa-kun seems otherworldly even to this day was because of that history.</p><p>He’s a sad child, raised without knowing love. He was collected as an art piece, not a human being.</p><p>The information of his finding was within the bounds of my foundation’s power.

But Nagisa-kun’s harsh with ordinary people… or more like, he has a hard time acknowledging them…</p><p>It was hard to get him to remember my name, so maybe saying ‘we became friends’ is faulty.”</p><p><strong>Hiyori:</strong> “Hmm~ Nagisa-kun is a genius, so he should have excellent memory along with the best of everything else, but…</p><p>He was raised isolated from the rest of the world during his early years, which is important to the development of personality for most people.</p><p>So he might really be lacking a ‘self’.</p><p>Human beings remember things starting from what’s related to their ‘selves’, so when one lacks that, they can become forgetful.</p><p>I also think it’ll be nice if I can leave some impression within him…</p><p>I mean to be showering him with a lot of my love, like watering a flower.</p><p>But it all feels like fruitless effort at times, and I start to view him like a bottomless hole.</p><p>Hey, Mao-kun—no, Trickstar… That’s the sort of child you’re fighting right now.</p><p>It’s a dark, deep hole that traps everything eternally, where not even light can find an escape…</p><p>He exists somewhere deep inside it, and you’ll have to find him.</p><p>You can’t storm in if you have no idea where the enemy is. So provoke him, toss some bombs…</p><p>Sing, dance, and pull him out of there.</p><p>That’s when things will really start. I’m his ally, his best friend, and even his family in the past; I’m too afraid to hurt him to use such forceful methods.</p><p>But you guys are his enemies, and you’re even in the middle of a war with him.</p><p>Plus, I know you’re experts at that…</p><p>Eichi-kun gave you all his seal of approval for that charm.</p><p>Anyone is pulled towards you. They’ll bend forward, wanting to see you closer. Because you’re idols…</p><p>So I have some expectations for you.</p><p>That’s why I went out of my way to teach you a lot about him, despite being busy. I’m cheering for you, so do your best.</p><p>But if you think that’s impossible, perhaps it’s better to pull back and retreat. …You don’t want to be swallowed into the darkness and vanish either, right?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “…….”</p><h3 id="isolation-4">Isolation 4</h3><p><strong>&gt; Adam’s Personal Room</strong></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…Ooh? Look, look, Hokke! There’s another message from Sally!</p><p>I can’t decipher these codes that fast, so tell me what it means! I wonder what Sally’s trying to tell us?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…….”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/F5jttTt.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hokke? It’s lonely if you don’t respond~….”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “(<em>munch</em>, <em>munch</em>, <em>gulp</em>)</p><p>…It’s against manners to speak while eating. Couldn’t you at least wait until I swallowed?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Hokke, you’re surprisingly well-mannered, aren’t you! Damn young master~♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “That ‘surprisingly’ part doesn’t sit well with me, but…</p><p>My mother talks non-stop during meal like you do. This is the result of looking to her as an example on ‘how not to be’.</p><p>Grandma can be pretty strict about manners, too. And everything Grandma says is the absolute truth of the world, thus you’re the one in the wrong.</p><p>In any case; I see… Isara apparently headed off to Reimei with Anzu.</p><p>They were investigating some things, by getting in touch with Eve and inquiring them.</p><p>Since suspicion might be cast on him if he acts too weird, he will be attending lessons seriously from here on, like we’ve been doing.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. He did say we should be obedient and follow the schedule Shuuetsu set up for us.</p><p>That’s what the previous coded message was about.</p><p>I guess it means we should make use of the chance to take whatever can be gained?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, Shuuetsu Academy’s lessons and lectures really are of excellent quality, so there should be many things we can absorb.</p><p>Even just today, I managed to erase many of the dissatisfaction I held towards my own performance.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I see~ I still can’t feel it. It’s hard to know how far I’ve come when I practice alone. I wish we can practice as a group.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes, that too will be necessary. There’s only one week until Autumn Live, after all.</p><p>For our performance there, we’ll need to train seriously together as Trickstar.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “We did get some practice done before we came to Shuuetsu, but there’s still some adjustments to be made, right? After observing the demographic, how the atmosphere’s gonna be like on the D-day, and the direction the concert’s taking.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Since the inn is reserved for our use with no other customer staying, we <em>can</em> practice as a group after returning from here.</p><p>But I’m having trouble deciding, since I feel it’s better to get some rest when we can or it’s going to come back to bite us later.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…I wonder if it’s Shuuetsu’s strategy to make us take classes and lessons individually, so we won’t have the chance to practice together.</p><p>No matter how much our individual skills might be honed, we won’t be able to make the best out of them during performance if we haven’t practiced together enough.</p><p>We might even fail to harmonize our growth and end up uncoordinated and stuff.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Perhaps. Though it’s laughable that they think they can break our unity with this.</p><p>But it is an effective tactic. It’s like receiving incessant blows.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Yet on the surface, they’re promoting peace and taking our hand like a friend!</p><p>Argh, I really don’t like this! Isn’t Shuuetsu being kind of snide!?</p><p>I say the student council president’s much more gallant in the way he tried to crush us head on!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I think he’s not too great either…</p><p>But well, Isara and Anzu saw through the enemy’s trap, and are pretending to have fallen for it.</p><p>They’re using the time to form a counterattack.</p><p>So we’ll place our faith in our comrades and treat ourselves to all the gifts our enemies are sending us.</p><p>But without accepting their invitation. And we’ll look for the timing they let their guard down to chew their throats off.</p><p>We’ll give them a tearful shock just as they think they’ve tamed us.</p><p>Whether to really join the agency or not, that can be carefully considered later after Autumn Live is done with.</p><p>For now, let’s harmonize our paces and come as one, to crush the enemy’s plan.</p><p>Since we’ve all been divided, we won’t come across each other much… even so, there’s no choice but to have faith, that all of us are fighting with the same feelings.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. Though I luckily have Hokke around this time, we’re all fundamentally on our separate ways, huh?</p><p>The length of our lessons and lectures conflict too, so it’s hard to contact each other.</p><p>It really does feel like they’re intentionally pulling us apart…</p><p>Since we’re known for our unity, breaking us apart has kind turned into the basic tactic of all our opponents thus far, huh?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Thank you for the meal.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, you’re finally done? That took too long! Hokke, you prudent head!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What’s that supposed to mean…? If I didn’t chew properly, it would be bad for digestion. It was a rather heavy meal, too.</p><p>I think I ate too much. I need to rest a bit or I won’t be able to move as I like.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Even the meals are extravagant, huh? Each person has a menu fitted especially for them, and non-Special Students are the ones who come to deliver…</p><p>Forget that, they even brought in a cooking suite and cooked in front of us.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “It’s like <em>what are we, royalties</em>? I don’t think I’ll ever get used to that, even if being served like that might be common for celebs.</p><p>Sometimes, my parents would bring me to some classy looking restaurant, too.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “You know, I love how you just vaguely refer it as ‘some classy looking restaurant’; I can feel the Hokkeness.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “What does Hokkeness even mean? Don’t start making up new words, Akehoshi.”</p><h3 id="isolation-5">Isolation 5</h3><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Anyway, I’m going to do some exercise to help digest my meal.</p><p>I can leave the cutlery here without cleaning them up, and the non-Special Students will come to pick them up, right?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “They’re really like slaves, aren’t they~? I don’t know how they endure that.</p><p>You know how I’m overly friendly with people, so I’ve been talking to the non-Special Students whenever I meet them, too.</p><p>But instead of respect or any feeling of kinship, I’m feeling fear from them.</p><p>Maybe they think they’ll lose their chance to become a Special Student if they make a blunder.</p><p>I encountered this kid who kind of resembled how Shinonon was like when we first met.</p><p>But he was trembling the whole time, looking at me like I’m a monster. It was… really sad.</p><p>I think Yumenosaki is a strange school too, but right now, the people there get rewarded if they put in enough effort.</p><p>We can strive diligently, competing as rivals of even standing. Upperclassmen, underclassmen, it doesn’t matter. We can all sing and smile together.</p><p>I like that better. Even if, as an idol, aiming for the heights by stepping on others might be what’s needed.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I see. That’s very like you. But I haven’t come to such a clean decision.</p><p>It hits me whenever I see my parents, that this industry really is just an endless, narrow gate…</p><p>A day when we must make a difficult choice will surely come.</p><p>However, I also think it’s not something someone else should force or hurry you to do.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “…!? Did you hear someone clap?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm?</p><p>Geh… uwaa, eh? W-Wha!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Calm down, Hokke! Use human language!</p><p>…Huh? Wait. Those people standing by the door are…”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…I just finished deciphering Isara’s message to the end. It seems he and Anzu didn’t go to Reimei only to investigate things.</p><p>Another of their objectives… was to get in touch with ‘a certain person’ who acts as an interim lecturer in Reimei.</p><p>To create several results out of a single action—Anzu has grown up splendidly.</p><p>But I don’t get what she wants! What is the meaning behind this…?</p><p>Why have my parents come to Shuuetsu Academy!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, so it’s really Hokke Papa and Hokke Mama! It seems my mom’s been in their care before, but I’ve never met them directly myself!</p><p>Uwaah, uwaah! Hello, sir, ma’am! Woow, their faces look exactly like what I’ve seen on TV☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Obviously.</p><p>Eh… What did you come here for, Father, Mother?</p><p>Even though you never came for parent observation days when I was in grade school because of work!</p><p>Ugya!? Don’t hug me! I don’t need your ‘<em>I’m sorry, Hocchan! It’s fine, I love you!’</em></p><p>Why are my parents so happy-go-lucky like this…!?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. Hokke’s gotten all red and flustered~ That’s so rare♪</p><p>I’m envious.</p><p>…Eh? What is it, Hokke Mama? Are you beckoning me to come closer?</p><p>Whoa, what a passionate hug!? P-Please stop~? It feels so weird to be hugged in front of my friend, by his mom no less!</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/nhSLm0N.jpg"></p><p>Ah but, you have the same scent as Hokke…♪”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Really? I can’t tell…</p><p>But seriously, what have you come here for? Especially mother.</p><p>I’ve heard from Tomoe-senpai that father teaches at Reimei Academy sometimes, so I can understand why he’s here.</p><p><em>You</em>, on the other hand, I don’t get. What are <em>you</em> doing? There’s no pattern to your action.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Gee, call her ‘Mama’, not just ‘you’! You’ve made her wear a sad face~ You unfilial son! Still in your rebellious phase!?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “I have never called that woman ‘Mama’, even once, since I was born.</p><p>…Umm, so what did you come for, really? Explain, Father. I’d like to believe you’re more sensible than her.</p><p>Hmm… So not just Reimei; you also have the right to hold lectures at Shuuetsu and other affiliated schools by contract.</p><p>And so you entered the school building by making use of that authority?</p><p>What for? You <em>can’t</em> be thinking to hold my hand through my lessons like proper parents after all this time, right?</p><p>You’re not very deft, Father; you don’t know how to teach outside of what you yourself can do, right?</p><p>I am different from you. I am not your imitation, so I don’t need your teaching.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Wow, sharp~… Treat your parents well, Hokke.</p><p>Just the fact you can lean on them and touch them makes you blessed, you know, Hokke.</p><p>Though… Sorry. I didn’t mean to sound spiteful; that kind of came out strangely.</p><p>Whoa!? This time Hokke Papa’s hugging me! Gyaa, it feels so weird to be hugged by someone who looks like Hokke!</p><p>Please, stop with your jesting, Your Majesty! Have mercy~!?</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/K9Bu4c9.jpg"></p><p>…Eh? I look like my father, too? Do I really~? I <em>am</em> copying his hairstyle and all…</p><p>But, I’m very happy to be told that.

Gather around, guys.</p><p>As the Autumn Live is right in front of us, let’s huddle and form a circle to raise our spirits.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “And have a strategic meeting that mustn’t be overheard while we’re at it, right?</p><p>I’m so happy we can all gather~ We’ve been moving separately throughout our time in Shuuetsu, after all!</p><p>Hey, hey, Anzu! And Fusshy and Blue-senpai and other support members too, come over here!</p><p>Let’s huddle together! We’re gonna combine our Yumenosaki powers into one and win against Adam!”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Fufu. I cannot even guess what this ‘Yumenosaki power’ is supposed to be, but I can somewhat see what you mean to say.</p><p>It is an honor to be invited to form a circle with you all.</p><p>However, we will huddle together only for a few seconds, and immediately return to our duties. There are still advertisements, stage adjustments, cleaning, as well as merchandising to be taken care of.</p><p>Of course, receiving your zeal, we shall be encouraged to give the duties our all.”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/GfsQDa7.jpg"></p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Right. Shuuetsu has started blatantly avoiding helping us altogether.</p><p>We did manage to get all the preparation ready before today somehow.</p><p>But the support members’ burdens are heavy, and we’ll still need to run about on the D-day.</p><p>It’s as if we support members are in the middle of our own war too, and not just the idols on the stage.</p><p>We’d certainly love to take seat back and see Trickstar’s concert through, but…</p><p>At present we’re being swamped with errands, so we might not be able to cheer for your stage properly.”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “That must also be part of Shuuetsu’s… no, Ibara’s plan. He has a plan for every detail, it’s almost impressive. Sly as always, really.</p><p>Usually, faced with such resourceful, unending traps, one would find no way to fight back and simply lose.</p><p>But for better or worse, Trickstar is not ‘usual’.</p><p>Why, because you are the up-and-coming idol group who triumphed over us <em>fine</em> even just once, and attained the right to represent us in the SS.</p><p>Ah, no. You are the representatives our school boasts of.</p><p>To be overpowered and lose without being able to do anything, without even understanding anything, like most would when faced against an opponent who is levels above them…</p><p>I believe if it’s you, you won’t fall to such an unfortunate end.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Of course. We’ll give it our best shot, so that won’t happen. We don’t need a repeat of Summer Live.</p><p>Everyone, you’ve worked hard until today. As the leader, allow me to express my gratitude, representing everyone in Trickstar.</p><p>Thanks to your efforts, I think we can take our opponent unaware.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Not that we can let our guard down either.</p><p>Adam is above us, and we’re being surrounded by enemies on all sides, with all these idols from Shuuetsu and its affiliated schools around. Plus, they’re eating away at our forces through their little tricks.</p><p>It’s gonna be a bitter struggle. Ah, this is so exciting.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Saying you’re excited there sounds off—so I would usually say, but I feel the same way.</p><p>It’s like something’s been set aflame inside me. Aah, live concerts really are great.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Gee, Hokke, you’re not even hiding your enthusiasm!</p><p>Your Papa and Mama are watching, after all! In a way, this is a ‘parent observation day’ for you, a deadly fancy one…☆ Bet you’re excited!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “…So my parents really came. What are they trying to pull, seriously?</p><p>Even after coaching us through our lesson on their first visit, they didn’t explain the most important part: what they came for.</p><p>I heard they’ve been responsible for quite a lot of idols’ classes and lessons in Shuuetsu and other affiliated schools, their class being a ‘special lecture’.</p><p>What meaning does this all hold? I have a hard time understanding.</p><p>Anzu, do you know something? You were the one who contacted them and requested them to do something for you, right?</p><p>Can I think of my parents’ appearance… as part of your strategy as well, Anzu?</p><p>If you invited them just to tease me, I’m going to be a little angry with you.</p><p>I was on edge throughout the week with the thought that those two might appear again, and wasted a lot of energy, you know.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ahaha. But you gave the lessons and lectures even more than your usual best so you wouldn’t feel ashamed even if your parents came anytime, right?</p><p>I’m sure you’ve grown a lot because of that.</p><p>I can feel it, you’re glowing with power from your head to your fingertips, Hokke! You’re overflowing with Hokkeness☆”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Has that ‘Hokkeness’ word made its way to your favorites, Akehoshi?</p><p>Well, that aside. Instead of me, what about you? Our costumes this time around weren’t Anzu’s design, so you must be feeling disgruntled, right?”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Ah, so I was right. I feel some Anzuness in it though, so it’s still a little surprising…</p><p>But it does feel more like <em>fine</em> than us. Like these fluttering things on our shoulders.”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Fufu. We are active across the nation and the globe, so part of the population thinks of <em>fine</em> as a trademark of Yumenosaki.</p><p>So the intent is to utilize a similar design to make it clear that you are also a Yumenosaki unit like us, thus gathering support from that population.</p><p>Asides from that, Anzu-san was the one to perform detailed adjustments to the design.</p><p>So perhaps that is where this ‘Anzuness’ you spoke of is coming from, Akehoshi-sama.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I see~ Now I can see why it’s so comfortable to wear!</p><p>Anzu’s the leading figure when it comes to our costumes, and she fully grasps the little changes in our physique too.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Fufu. She’d often take our measurements with a tailor’s tape even in the classroom. Maybe that’s Anzu’s hobby.</p><p>It was unnerving at first, but Anzu looked so happy doing it, so I couldn’t bring myself to say anything.</p><p>But even though she loves making costumes so much, were our costumes this time outsourced for the most part?”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Fufu. It’s not so much that she outsourced it… The agency decided several details like the design of the costumes and stage, for this Autumn Live.</p><p>And it wasn’t smart to oppose that, without any big reason to.</p><p>Anzu-chan also had other things she must get done as a producer, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Yuzuru:</strong> “Indeed. Time and stamina both have their limits…</p><p>I believe Anzu-san gave a careful consideration on what she should prioritize, so you all can release your full strength on the performance.</p><p>Although… the fact she insisted to make detailed adjustments to the costumes certainly astonishes me, as it must mean she really loves such a work.”</p><h3 id="battle-2">Battle 2</h3><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “I see~ Until now, Anzu has always tried to do everything herself and ended up getting kind of overheated on the real deal, but…</p><p>Even if it broke your heart, you made a choice and cast some things away, didn’t you, Anzu?</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/1Evj5xD.jpg"></p><p>That’s commendable. No, not that—thank you… for giving it your all.</p><p>Our opponent is that famous Adam, and it might be a lonely struggle among many enemies, but I don’t have any fear.</p><p>We’re going to win, so watch us. Like you always do, from the VIP seat closest to us.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Akehoshi. You might speak of winning, but there’s no real victory and defeat in the Autumn Live.</p><p>It’s different from Yumenosaki. There’s no DreamFest system… no voting mechanism either.</p><p>Performers will simply take the stages following the schedule.</p><p>The audience will move as they like, watching the performance they’re interested in, or buying food from the stalls to eat.”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Like a summer music fest, huh? Or rather… it’s really like an ‘event’.</p><p>Numbers of audience gathered, how heated the performance was… those sort of results that decide the winner and loser become hard to tally.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Alright, then we should make our own victory condition! If we can gather more people than Adam and get them heated up more, it’s our win!”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Challenge accepted. I don’t hate playing for stakes. Well, it’s another school’s event this time around, so it’s fundamentally different from usual DreamFests.</p><p>So it might be better to not think of victory or defeat, and just perform to our all.</p><p>The fight hasn’t started yet so we can still relax like this, but I doubt we’ll be able to think of such matters once it begins.</p><p>It’s a big event, after all.</p><p>Even if to the agency, it might simply be another routine to go through…</p><p>The number of people mobilized and the anticipation rival that of Yumenosaki’s S1.</p><p>It makes you realize how enormous the enemy is. Well, not that we’ll get cold feet from that.</p><p>We had our training and did everything we could. This is the best our current selves could work up. Whether it’ll work or not is still left to be seen, but let’s just do what we can.</p><p>And if possible, then I want revenge. Let’s work to pay back that loss we experienced.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Copy that, Leader♪”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Ooi, don’t get fired up all by yourselves.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup. Since when Trickstar became a two-person unit like Adam~?”</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/111iiXM.jpg"></p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Sally! Ukki! Huh? I thought you guys already came over when Hokke said to gather around!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Sorry, sorry. We did hear you guys say to gather around, but we were a little far, so…</p><p>It was tough trying to cut through the crowd, so we arrived a little late.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Oh, where did you go? Hehe, let me guess: the toilet?”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “No no, we just made a visit to Adam for a bit.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Huh? Why? We all visited them to say ‘Let’s do our best today’ at the start, so we already concluded the formality, right?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Yup. Peaceful and cordial on the surface.</p><p>They didn’t reveal their malicious intent until the end, huh…</p><p>I guess they still think we can be dealt with diplomatically… or rather, through little traps.</p><p>Plus, they welcomed and serviced us lavishly when in Shuuetsu.</p><p>They showed hints of trying to waver us to their side, to join the agency.</p><p>They probably wanted to win us over.</p><p>Rather than killing the enemy, crushing us completely, it’s certainly more profitable to pull us to their side. So they faked their kindness.</p><p>But I couldn’t predict how things might turn out if they decide to have war and crush us with their all, so…</p><p>I spent the week investigating various things.</p><p>Since thankfully, my face isn’t that known yet, I pretended to be one of the underlings and mingled with some non-Special Students…</p><p>I’m pretty good at that.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “When wearing glasses and acting all mousy, Makoto looks like the very image of an ‘underachiever’ and gets made light of, eh?</p><p>I can pull off something similar too, but it definitely won’t work with Subaru and Hokuto.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmph. I can do it if I try too. I’m in the Theater Club.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Nope, for better or worse, you guys just give off an aura. Makoto’s amazing when he’s serious too, but he knows how to hide it when needed.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Right. So I attended lessons like instructed, but also investigated the scene and searched the net, basically going from all sides.</p><p>There’s need to know what the enemy troops are like, or the war will be really daunting.</p><p>Their defense is steely, like anticipated; they control their information flow well so I had a hard time during my research.</p><p>But when meeting with Adam with Isara-kun, I got to read their reactions and stuff.</p><p>I think I have all the information needed. …It’s just that, from my analysis, I think fighting against Adam for real is going to be dangerous.</p><p>We won’t come out unharmed.</p><p>If a war breaks out and we <em>really</em> want to win, we should be prepared to make certain sacrifices. It’s going to be an undisputed mutual destruction.</p><p>Although I think they won’t fire a real ammo until the important big game, SS.</p><p>On the other hand, this means it might be better for us to focus on defending too, and minimize the damage.</p><p>Because I believe they won’t come for the kill yet this time.</p><p>Of course, I’ll follow whatever strategy our producer Anzu-chan and our leader Hidaka-kun decide on.</p><p>I just want to warn that it might be too soon to put our lives on the line and use up all of the cards in our sleeves.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Hmm. SS is the big game, and this is to the end a skirmish. Even so, I feel if we don’t give our all… if we let our guard down, it’s going to be an instant death.</p><p>It’s hard to be the lower ranked ones.

Well, he’s definitely someone that might feel alien… freakish for us.</p><p>But he’s the boss of our greatest adversary in SS, Eden.

You’re probably still thinking about what that Nagisa guy said.</p><p>But instead of what the enemy, what some random guy said, I want you to recall the memories we’ve had together…</p><p>I want you to believe in all the happenings, the conversations amassed within them.</p><p>Sally, have we ever said that you’re like a flashlight—or that we don’t need you because of that, even once?</p><p>We’ve been comrades who have faith in each other, who love and support each other, right?</p><p>We won’t distance ourselves from you, and we don’t want to… So don’t let it disturb you; stay by our side today, tomorrow, to the future and forever, okay?</p><p>It’s not Trickstar without you.

Pierced me right on the fragile depth I’ve always held inside, at first contact…</p><p>And it hurt so much, it was so painful, that I wished I could spared from it all, but…</p><p>I’m glad someone said it to me <em>this time</em>. It’s something I’ll have to face sooner or later.</p><p>You guys are kind, so you’ll never say anything cruel to me. That’s why I’m glad to meet an enemy who would strike without mercy.</p><p>I’m an unfair, stealthy guy who always stay at my safe zone.</p><p>I was even deluded enough to think that was my role, that it was the necessary step to protect and support you guys, who always try to do the impossible.</p><p>So I’m thrilled.</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/h4ps2Wq.jpg"></p><p>That I have something to improve, that there’s a fearsome enemy aiming for that weak spot of mine, that I still need to fight to death…</p><p>That’s totally like a shounen manga.</p><p>I feel like I’ve finally become one of you guys in the truest meaning.</p><p>It’s the producer’s job to convey the battle strategy from the safe zone. Me, I need to head to the battlefield with you guys and bathe in blood.</p><p>Maybe, I <em>might</em> really turn out to be a foolish flashlight who’s mistaking himself for a star.</p><p>Because you guys are shining so blindingly, I might have been deluded to think that I’m shining too, when in fact I’m just receiving light from you.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “That’s not true! You’re Trickstar too, Sally! You’re our star!”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Thanks. But when need be, I want you to discard me.</p><p>Cut me off and don’t look back. Find a star that shines brighter and let him in.</p><p>If you do that, you’ll never lose to anyone.</p><p>To win SS is the dream of all idols, and your dad’s ungranted desire, right… Subaru?</p><p>If it’s what you need to do to win, then I want you to discard me anytime.”</p><p><strong>Subaru:</strong> “Sally…? I don’t want that! Winning is worth nothing if you’re not with us!”</p><p><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> “Isara-kun… You shouldn’t say that. It won’t make anyone happy.</p><p>I know because I’ve experienced it. If you need to cast everything aside to achieve something, you’ll be left with nothing but a feeling of vacuity in your grasp.</p><p>You’ll regret it. There’s no blue bird of happiness waiting at such a place.”</p><p><strong>Mao:</strong> “Yep. So I’ll work hard so that won’t have to happen.</p><p>I’ll desperately hold onto you guys and cover what I lack with effort. I’ll shine even if it sucked every bit of life out of me.</p><p>I’ll make a huge explosion with the amount of heat a flashlight shouldn’t have, and turn into a star like you guys.</p><p>For that sake I stepped out of my safe zone, and I’ll give it my all even if things are painful and tough.</p><p><img alt data-src="https://i.imgur.com/W2ln4kt.jpg"></p><p>That makes me happy. I’ve always yearned for something like that.</p><p>You know, I’ve also wanted to become like manga protagonists that I love… to become like you guys, and shine dazzlingly.</p><p>I’ve burned the bridges behind me. When there’s no escape, there’s also no choice but to fight head on. I didn’t want to be hurt, to be in pain, to be hated by anyone, but…</p><p>I need to bear all that to live on. Nah—if I can’t bear that, I’ll just end up with a tranquil, drawn-out life full of regrets. And that’s not what I want.</p><p>Ever since I was a brat, I thought I was fine with being second or third.</p><p>If I come out first, I’ll have to bear with someone’s resentment and hate. I’ve always hated competitions; I couldn’t feel happy with winning or losing.</p><p>Losing is frustrating, but winning means I’ve kicked someone down and hurt them.</p><p>Everyone told me I’m kind for that, but I was just a spoiled brat who wanted to avoid any unpleasant feelings.</p><p>I don’t want to be like that anymore. I want to fight together with you guys, aim for the top, and win proudly with a smile on me.</p><p>To say ‘<em>How’s that? Aren’t I… Aren’t</em> we <em>awesome?’</em></p><p>To say that <em>Trickstar</em>’s awesome! I want to take pride in it to my heart’s fill, and have someone praise me!</p><p>Not getting commended for being an adult, by handing over the trophy to someone else!</p><p>I wanted to do something great with my own — with our own power, so someone would praise me!</p><p>Don’t you think that’s stupid? I’ve never had that experience!</p><p>I’ve always treated everything like I’m not involved, like I understand the big picture, like I’m mature for backing off!</p><p>But I’m still a child! I’m a child who dream, like you guys!</p><p>So I want to wake up to that fact and make a racket without caring for what people think! Like you guys do…!</p><p>This is my own selfish circumstance, and I’m just doing what I want, so I won’t hear you out even if you ask if I’m fine with it!</p><p>I don’t care if this wasn’t the correct answer! I’m going to do what I’ve avoided doing all this time!</p><p>And you know, when I decided all these things—the fun just came to me!</p><p>Ahaha! I want to sing and dance right now!

My mother aside, my father was especially invited and pleaded to be a lecturer here.</p><p>He’s not a subordinate of the agency, but a business partner.</p><p>And his position as a lecturer means he’s someone who guides students and assesses them.</p><p>So if they can gain my parents’ favor, becoming a Special Student won’t be a mere dream…</p><p>It’s possible to lead the students to think that way, and perhaps my parents intentionally hinted at it.
