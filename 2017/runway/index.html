grounds</strong></p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/JA9FPhg.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;(<em>pant, pant</em>)…</p><p>I-I give! I can’t run anymore! Break time!&quot;</p><p>(My stamina has really taken a blow…</p><p>Trickstar has been at the top of its popularity lately—I might’ve took it too much for the ride, even more than I realized.</p><p>Ah, no. Maybe I was unconsciously putting on brakes… because if we get too popular, things might end up like back when I was a kid model.</p><p>If that’s what this is, then I’m hopeless. I haven’t changed, neither have I grown…</p><p>I should have been reborn as a new me, thanks to everyone in Trickstar and Transfer student-chan—and yet.</p><p>If I come to a standstill here, I’ll just be repeating history.)</p><p>&quot;…All right. I’ll give it another shot, with my all.</p><p>First, let’s start by building some stamina, like Oogami-kun told me!</p><p>A few more laps around the sports grounds, then I’ll move onto muscle training! Until the Spring Music Festival starts, I should at least restore the same amount of strength I’ve lost!</p><p>Go for it, Makoto! Don’t lose, Makoto! Hip-hip-hurray! ♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> “Oh? Yuuki-kun, what are you doing over there?”</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/A23Ndsr.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Wahya!?</p><p>Ah—Ooh… It’s you, Narukami-kun. Hello♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Hello~♪</p><p>Ufufu. You address me like a stranger. Instead of ‘Narukami-kun’, going with ‘Arashi’ is fine, you know? ‘Onee-chan’ or ‘Naruko-chan’ are also welcome♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Mm… Things have gotten a little perilous between Trickstar and Knights after DDD a while back, so…</p><p>Wouldn’t it be bad for us to call each other by nicknames and act like we’re friends?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Oh, you speak of the topic like it’s not your problem. But anyway, I’d like to have the sports grounds cleared so I can clean up…</p><p>It’s about time for the school to close, too. Can you do some yoga at home instead if you really want to do sports?&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Ah, sorry; it’s already that late…?</p><p>Narukami-kun, so you were cleaning after the sports grounds.</p><p>Is it an ‘on-campus part time’? I heard Knights has been doing nothing but that recently…&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Nuh-huh. I’m part of the Track Club, you see.</p><p>Club activities are mostly on break before the school festival, but I have my reason to be training and getting my body to shape.</p><p>So I took the initiative to do some jogging and stuffs. In our Track Club, there’s rule that the person who uses the sports grounds last has to clean up♪</p><p>But that aside, you can’t be sprawling at a place like this!</p><p>It’s still pretty chilly; you might catch a cold. Not to mention, you’ll dirty your clothes.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, that’s okay! It’s just jersey, anyway! The sort of clothes I don’t mind dirtying♪”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;No, no. That doesn’t make it any less of a handful to wash, right?</p><p>Jerseys might be long-lasting, but you have to take care of your clothes, or they’ll soon go to waste.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “I guess that’s true. Ahaha, Narukami-kun, you say the exact same things as Izumi-san.”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Well, I talk to him the most in the unit. I’ve known him for pretty long too, so it can’t be helped that I took some of his habits.</p><p>You, though, aren’t like Izumi-chan at all, are you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Nope… He took care of me in the past, but we were separated for longer. Even if he influenced me some, they’re probably erased with time.”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;That makes him sound like a contaminant. He’ll be furious to hear that, you know. Heavens forbid that♪</p><p>…Please don’t hate Izumi-chan too much, if you can.</p><p>I don’t think he’s such a weakling a little mental stress leaves him in disorder, but I still feel sorry, when I see him.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Uh, rather than hating him, I’m scared because I don’t get him… Why is that person so insistent on getting involved with me?</p><p>Even though he was cruel enough to lock me up…</p><p>He just casually appeared in front of my house in the morning and said, _Yuu-kuuun, let’s go to school together_♪, you know? That’s practically psychopathic!</p><p>I don’t get him. Really. I don’t know how you can get along okay with that person, Narukami-kun.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Oh, I’m not okay, believe me. He drives me nuts♪</p><p>Wait, now it sounds like we’re talking behind his back.</p><p>My, this isn’t good… Recently, I’ve been doing nothing but volunteers to restore Knights’ name; it must be the pent-up stress getting to me.</p><p>Well, we’re reaping what we sown. Ah geez, this is bad for my skin…</p><p>At least on the day of the Fashion Show, I want to look more beautiful than anyone else.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Aah, I heard Knights is participating on the Fashion Show for the Festival Eve, is that right?</p><p>Izumi-san said something like _Yuu-kun, let’s walk on the runway together_♪, so I know.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;No; rather than Knights, it’s more that I took the job personally, for myself. I have reasons as to why I can’t refuse.</p><p>Is Trickstar going to perform on the Festival Eve?&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Yeah. We’ll perform in this event called the Spring Music Festival. We’re teaming up with UNDEAD to form a jazz band, and we’re going to play some instruments there.</p><p>I thought gaining some stamina should be the first step, so I’ve just been thoughtlessly running laps around the sports grounds.</p><p>…Oops. Sorry. Maybe I’m holding you up.</p><p>All that talking refreshed me, so I can help with cleaning up, if you want?</p><p>It must be tough to do it by yourself, Narukami-kun♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Oh my, thank you. You’re such a good boy. I can see why the seniors like you.</p><p>I was always bad at <em>that</em>… hence people tend to think of me like a cheeky, shitty brat who wouldn’t listen to his seniors.&quot;</p><h3 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h3><p><strong>&gt; Rooftop</strong></p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/ijJ1m5y.jpg"></p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Nggh… Yuu-kuuun, how could you be talking so friendlily with Naru-kun!? Why!? And yet, you’re always blatantly avoiding me, your Onii-chan!”</p><p>(Aargh, geez. Soooo irritating. I came to the rooftop for a change of pace, but instead I got to see something I’d rather not! I feel sick.</p><p>While I can just harass Naru-kun tomorrow to vent, how will you pay for this, Yuu-kun?</p><p>Should I cross-examine him by asking ‘<em>You were so friendly with Naru-kun, but why wouldn’t you even talk to me’</em>?</p><p>But that’s just so pathetic, you think my pride will allow that?)</p><p>“Aaaargh geez! I’m <em>so</em> ticked off! This world isn’t kind to me…!”</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/6Ky7Va8.jpg"></p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Ohh? I spy with my little eye: Izumi-san! [An unlikely encounter brought by fate]—what a wonderful chance meeting… Hahahaha☆”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Uegh, Mikejima… You’re still hanging around the school? It’s closing time soon, you know?</p><p>Well, not that you were ever the type to follow the rules…</p><p>It’s because you were such a troublemaker that the school didn’t like you and banished you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Hahaha. If it’s about the exchange program, I asked to be picked for the part, you knooow!</p><p>It was quite the wonderful experience, too. Like they say, life isn’t always rainbows and sunshine, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “You sure love your aphorisms… sooooo annoying! What, trying to show off how you’re a man of principles?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Hahaha. What’s wrooong? You seem to be ticked off? OK, OK, come at me! You can vent on me all you like!</p><p>I’ll receive all of it! <em>Hakkeyoi! Nokotta, nokotta</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>…☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “What’s with you? So obnoxious. I’m feeling down right now so don’t talk to me! Aah, I’m so ticked off! Shoo-shoo!”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;You’re as wild as a cat on mating season…</p><p>I came up to the rooftop because I was tired too, so I don’t have the stamina to argue with you. I hope you’ll forgive me, Izumi-san.</p><p>Everything Izumi-san said and did was right, and I was very wrong. Hence, I’ll reflect on it and apologize. It’s my loss.</p><p>And that’s that. The end…♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “You. You’re always so quick to back down, and unconditionally, too… If you’re a boy like me, you’ve got to fight for things sometimes. Damn defeatist.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Hahaha. Maybe it’s just like boys to be bothered by things like victory and defeat. But I think while getting along can be more difficult than arguing, that’s precisely why it’s worth it!</p><p>Don’t you think so, Izumi-saan?&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Urgh, you’re making my head hurt. I don’t know how ‘Leo-kun’ could be friends with someone like you.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Hahaha. Curiously enough, we really hit it off.</p><p>Leo-san always sees the good in people.</p><p>He’ll confidently say ‘I love you!’ to anyone, so to be friends with him, all one has to do is open up, and accept that.</p><p>It’s because that’s what Leo-san is like, that even the twisted Izumi-san could be friends with him, no?&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Hmph… I don’t want you sticking around me any longer than this, so I’ll be going. You should go home soon, too.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “That sounds great, but I’ve got a mountain of work waiting, see. I’m planning to ask the teachers for permission so I can work until late tonight.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Aah… You’re single-handedly producing the Festival Eve, I heard?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Yep. I’m administrating the whole thing, including the school festival itself.</p><p>To be more precise though, I’m acting as an assistant to bridge the Producer—Anzu-san—and the teachers and student council.</p><p>Anyway, I looove festivals and all that racket, after all! So I practically interfered into something that had nothing to do with me, hahahaha☆</p><p>The teachers have left us to ourselves under the claim of treasuring student autonomy…</p><p>While the student council recently experienced a painful loss, which dropped their unifying force. They’re not free to make a move.</p><p>And what’s left is the lone producer, who’s still just a weak girl.</p><p>Someone has to support her from the shadows—and for now, I think that’s my role.</p><p>Because I’m not in any unit, I have the freedom to move; I also have the time to.</p><p>Even back then, Anzu-san was always the type to keep everything to herself. I’m worried.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “…? Mikejima, you knew that ‘amateur’ from before?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Yeah. Though we were kindergarteners back then, and she doesn’t remember me…♪”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Hmm… Well, you’re a perfect superman who can do everything, so I guess things will be fine.</p><p>In the past, you were treated as the go-to for every problem, weren’t you?&quot;</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Hahaha. That’s overestimating me. I just inherited all the tricks Rei-san cultivated, is all.</p><p>Of course I’m trying my best to be an ‘omnipotent helper’ like Rei-san is.</p><p>Anyone will be relieved to know there’s someone to depend on when they’re in trouble.</p><p>Although I couldn’t find a place for me anywhere, at least I want to become… ‘a comfortable place to go’, without turning away anybody.</p><p>Like everyone’s Mama, you know? I know I have a long way to go, though.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Hmn~…. Then how about leaving some of your jobs on us Knights? We’ve been pretty much acting like a helper troupe lately.</p><p>I’m already set to appear on the Fashion Show Naru-kun selfishly accepted, though.</p><p>Kasa-kun is still green, while Kuma-kun is apathetic, so it’s just me and Naru-kun appearing with the two of us.</p><p>I think if it’s just one easy job, those two kids on stand-by can settle it for you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Hahaha! Thanks for the kind offer♪</p><p>Things are going okay for now, but I’ll be sure to depend on you when I need it!</p><p>Let’s help each other in times of needs—then we’ll be a ‘team’ that overwhelms even the strongest ‘individuaal’!</p><p>That’s the normal in Yumenosaki Academy now, right? It might take some time for me to get used to it…♪&quot;</p><h3 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h3><p><strong>&gt; Corridor</strong></p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/mzMLroF.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Here I go, Transfer student-chan.</p><p>♪<sub>♪</sub>♪</p><p>~…♪</p><p>~♪ ~♪ ~♪</p><p>W-What do you think? I tried playing one song with the tambourine… H-How was it? Let me hear your objective opinion as a producer!</p><p>Ahaha… Transfer student-chan is innocently clapping her hands and praising how good I am.</p><p>I’m happy to hear that, but I need you to properly tell me where I’m doing wrong.</p><p>Fufu. It seems you’re not too good at that sort of thing, Transfer student-chan.</p><p>Everyone in Trickstar is really kind too, despite words. No matter how crappy my performance was, they’d still look for something to praise.</p><p>But then Oogami-kun would put me down in the most heartbreaking way possible…</p><p>I wish there’s someone who would keep the balance, pointing out my flaws and giving me the correct advice.</p><p>Sakuma-senpai fits the bill, but he’s something of a unifying leader for both of us Trickstar and UNDEAD until the Spring Music Festival.</p><p>He’s everyone’s Sakuma-senpai. I can’t have him dealing with just me.</p><p>Hmm? What is it, Transfer student-chan? <em>I’m sorry</em>, you say?</p><p>Now, why are you saying sorry? It’s a wonderful thing, to be able to put yourself in others’ shoes and be kind. In reality, polishing others’ talent by praising what they do is ideal.</p><p>But see, if I’m endorsed too much, I think I’ll turn into a hopeless guy…♪</p><p>Fufu. Well, anyway. I’ll be going to the Light Music Clubroom to practice for Spring Music Festival. Transfer student-chan, you should drop by to see how we’re doing if you’re free.</p><p>I can safely say everyone will be happy to see you. Of course, that includes me.</p><p>Umm… Because we were doing other things along the way, I can’t really tell, but… we’re done with all of our class duties, right?</p><p>Now we just have to give the class journal to Sagami-sensei.</p><p>Yeah, good work to you too~♪</p><p>Because there was always everyone else, we don’t have much time to talk with just the two of us like this, so I’m happy I could have you for myself today, Transfer student-chan.</p><p>Class duty is a pain, but this one’s lucky~♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Ooi! Anzu-san! I can hear your voice! Are you over thereee?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Uhya?! Transfer student-chan, what’s wrong? Why are you hiding behind me?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Excuse meeeeeee☆</p><p>Ooh? Huuh? Was it my mistakee? I’m pretty sure I heard Anzu-san’s voice coming from over here. Hmmm?&quot;</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/CibhKv5.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Uh… Mikejima-senpai, was it? Do you need something from 2-A?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Ooh? If my memory serves, you’re Makoto-san from the Game Research Club, right?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, I dropped out of the Game Club. Stuffs happened, and now I’m a member of the Tennis Club~♪”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Oh-hoh! I see, I see. It’s nice to remain a wanderer, while you’re still young!</p><p>Try your hands on everything until you find something just for you! Hahaha☆</p><p>That aside! Makoto-san, have you seen Anzu-san around by chance? I have something I’d like to ask heer♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Eh? Anzu… Ah, you mean Transfer student-chan.</p><p>(<em>whispers</em>) Umm, hello… He’s calling for you~… Transfer student-chan?</p><p>Whoa, whoa! Don’t hide yourself under my blazer! Are you some kind of small animal, Transfer student-chan!?&quot;</p><p>(S-Somehow it seems like… Transfer student-chan is afraid of Mikejima-senpai? I took her for a spunky girl who wouldn’t falter at the face of most people, though…</p><p>Ahaha. She’s trembling. This side of her might be refreshingly cute, too♪</p><p>No, wait, I shouldn’t be watching in comfort! Umm, let’s see, what to do… What should I do at a time like this?</p><p>For now, I can try talking our way out of this?)</p><p>“E-Excuse me! Mikejima-senpai, what is it do you need from Transfer student-chan?”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;<em>Transfer student-chan</em>? So that’s what she’s usually called! To be called by a nickname is proof she’s getting along with everybody!</p><p>Great, great! Since Anzu-san is such a shy kid, I was worried she wasn’t making any friends! Hahaha☆</p><p>That aside! While it doesn’t seem Anzu-san is here, I’ll say this just in case:</p><p>If you don’t show yourself soon, I’ll expose your embarrassing secrets from kindergarten, Anzu-san!☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Oh. I might want to hear that.”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Oh-hoh? So you’ve finally shown yourself, Anzu-san! [How ludicrous]! Were you trying to hide? You can’t trick my eyes, you knoow?</p><p>Come here, come over here~ Let’s go with Mama♪</p><p>I have things I need your help on. There have been some troubles with the Festival Eve plans, you see…</p><p>I was away for some time, so I’m not too familiar with the school’s current institution.</p><p>Hence, I’d love to borrow some wisdom from Anzu-san, said to be the up-and-coming produceer!</p><p>Let’s go together! Of course, I won’t force you if you have something else to do, though.</p><p>Could it be you were in the middle of going on a date with Makoto-san?</p><p>Well, you guys looked so friendly with each other, hahaha☆ Are you dating him? Introduce your boyfriend to Mama!</p><p>Hmm? <em>You’re not Mama</em>, you say?</p><p>[How unfortunate]! You say some very sad things, Anzu-san.</p><p>I wonder if you’re having your rebellious phase… but that means you’re starting to bloom into a full person, which is something to celebrate! Hahaha☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> (W-What is this, I wonder? I don’t really get what he’s saying, but it seems Mikejima-senpai… has some sort of complicated connection with Transfer student-chan?)</p><h3 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h3><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/LshlnDs.jpg"></p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> (Aah… Another lonely runway for me today.</p><p>It’s nothing new, so I don’t mind… I know I have the sort of twisted personality that gathers hate from people.</p><p>Especially the period from right before I entered high school… I was at the peak of my popularity—but unable to go further, I vented my frustration on my surrounding.</p><p>I didn’t have the calm to care for others; even I realize now that I was being a lame brat.</p><p>But that’s okay. Shallow people who change their opinions at the flick of a switch can’t be trusted; being hated by them doesn’t hurt me.</p><p>If I show results… Once I show them that I’m the top model, I know they’ll change their attitude to me by 180 degree.</p><p>You guys just keep rotating like a wind vane.</p><p>I’m tired of seeing that. I’ve had plenty. Yet I know I can’t stop or turn back when I’ve come this far.</p><p>Life is short. If I shatter halfway, that means the past me who worked so hard for this will never be rewarded.</p><p>So I’ll keep walking down this path. It doesn’t matter that no one follows behind me. You’re just going to be in the way, anyway. All of you.</p><p>Yuu-kun was the only one. At least, until I entered high school.</p><p>Little, clueless, silly Yuu-kun… was the only one who looked at me with eyes that sparkled like jewels.</p><p>He praised me. <em>You’re so amazing</em>, he said.</p><p><em>I want to be like you, Izumi-san.</em> So innocently.</p><p>I was so happy, Yuu-kun.</p><p>But… if you turn into someone like me, you’ll just be repeating the same mistake, Yuu-kun.</p><p>I knew that, but his innocent praises got to my head… as a result of that, I only watched as Yuu-kun sunk into the bloody pond until his neck.</p><p>So I thought I shouldn’t let that happen the second time, but…</p><p>Despite acting like I’m better than him as a senior, I guess in the end I was still a brat.</p><p>He told me he wanted to be like me, so in my happiness, I taught him all sort of things.</p><p>However. With each new thing I taught him, Yuu-kun matured.</p><p>From an innocent child, to a filthy adult covered in mud… I should’ve known that.</p><p>But I was so happy I couldn’t hold back… I couldn’t stop myself. I couldn’t do anything.</p><p>I only watched as Yuu-kun was soiled.</p><p>No—<em>I</em> was the one who soiled him.</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>I want to apologize and make it up all to you… But you wouldn’t even let me near you, Yuu-kun.</p><p>……)</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Umm~…? Sorry, can I have a minute?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Hmm? Huh, is this a dream…?</p><p>Hey, wait! Naru-kun, get rid of the background music! I can’t hear Yuu-kun’s voice like this! How can you be so dull!?&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, you don’t need to listen to him, Narukami-kun! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to interrupt you guys…”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> “Oookaay, so whose orders should I listen to…?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Mine, obviously!</p><p>More importantly… What’s wrong, Yuu-kuuun?</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/YlseuNg.jpg"></p><p>Aaah, are you finally going to be honest with me?</p><p>You’re starting to feel like participating in the Fashion Show with me, right!? I’ll welcome you anytime…☆&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ugyaa!? Don’t jump at me like that! Pervert…! S-Save me, Narukami-kun!”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Wait up, why are you asking Naru-kun to save you? I don’t get it! When your most dependable Onii-chan in the world is right in front of you!</p><p>Tell me, since when were you and Naru-kun friends? I didn’t hear about that!&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Izumi-chaaan. Not like it matters, but can we finish the Fashion Show rehearsal first?</p><p>I’m tired of you making me go through this with you so many times.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Haah? Like I can end things in such a half-hearted state!</p><p>The gym is ours to use for the whole day, okay? We’re gonna stay behind and practice until we’ve got this down perfectly!&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Umm. You two are participating in the Fashion Show for the Festival Eve, right…?</p><p>I heard about it from Mikejima-senpai~ It’s so fitting for you two, huh♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Not <em>two</em>, but <em>three</em>, right? Yuu-kun is going to join the Fashion Show with me, after all…♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “What is this person babbling off about!? His eyes look totally serious—isn’t he completely losing the ability to separate fiction from reality? It’s scary!”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> “Ahaha… Not that it matters, but Yuuki-kun: you needed something from us, right? What is it? You said something about Mama?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Mama? Ah, I guess that’s what you call Mikejima-senpai…</p><p>Umm, so you see. He asked me to do something for him. How should I put this—I’m here to negotiate.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Negotiate? If it’s Yuu-kun asking, I’m willing to give anything unconditionally, though?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Like I said! Why do you keep saying crazy things with the most serious look on you, Izumi-san? Were you always this kind of person?</p><p>Weren’t you usually a bit colder…?&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Ahaha. Izumi-chan has been practicing for the Fashion Show nonstop, you know.</p><p>Maaaybe he’s a little out of it. Not enough calm to gather his thoughts, I guess?</p><p>We’re having a harder time than we thought with this Fashion Show…</p><p>I thought it was the perfect job for us, but it turns out we need to deal with everything ourselves, starting from the preparation.</p><p>I know you guys in Trickstar always do things this way, though. I’m surprised by how well you guys are doing, really.&quot;</p><h3 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h3><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/GGysymg.jpg"></p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;That’s how it is. We’re pretty busy, and while Izumi-chan might be saying some dumb things…</p><p>We might be in trouble if you ask for something too difficult from us.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Ah, that’s okay. I think this won’t be much of a burden for you two…</p><p>Umm, to put it simply: it seems the budget for Festival Eve is looking tight.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Aah… I thought that might be case. It’s nothing but a pre-event for the school festival, yet everyone is putting a lot of power into their show.</p><p>Mikejima’s at the head, right? Just how bad is he at accounting?&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;It might be partly Mikejima-senpai, but mostly that the whole business itself is messy. It seems the scale for both the Festival Eve and school festival is particularly large this year.</p><p>Which means the whole academy is fired up for these events, and that’s a happy thing in itself.</p><p>But the budget, arrangement, and preparations simply can’t keep up.</p><p>So, umm. It’s hard for me to say this, but… the outfits you guys are presenting for Fashion Show will be shared properties.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;…What?</p><p>What the heck? Are you stupid? I wear outfits fitted perfectly for me and <em>only</em> for me. I won’t back down on this.</p><p>Shared? That’s the number one word I hate in this world.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;I know you’ll say that. I’m really, seriously sorry, but we can’t proceed if you don’t cooperate, Izumi-san…</p><p>Apparently there’s no other place to cut down the budget on.</p><p>The management staffs are troubled too~ Can’t you please be the adult and cooperate?&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Aaaaaaabsolutely <em>not</em>.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Uuh~… Really? No matter what? Umm… I use the word <em>shared</em>, but I think it’s a little different from what you’re thinking, Izumi-san.</p><p>Umm, I don’t know how to explain this, but…&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “What <em>is</em> it? I’m getting annoyed! Be more clear, can’t you?”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> “All right, Izumi-chan. That’s your cue to take a deep breath… Nothing to gain from flaring up at Yuuki-kun. Let’s listen to what he has to say until the end♪”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Ugya!? I told you not to cling to me, you damned okama!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha… Well, see. There’s that outfit you’re wearing, right, Izumi-san?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Ah, this?</p><p>It looks pretty good, right? It was quite expensive too; I don’t have money left to spend on the special effects and all that jazz, but… ah well, it was a good purchase.</p><p>Heheh. I had my favorite designer, that I’ve paid attention to since my kids’ model days, make it for me♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto</strong>: “Huh… That means I might know him too?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Don’t you? You know, the one who often gave out snacks during breaks…</p><p>It would’ve made me fat, and I hated being fed like a pet, but he’s good at his job, at least.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ah, as I thought. I was thinking I’ve seen that style before. That person, huh… how nostalgic; he was always so kind to us.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Wasn’t it for his own sake?</p><p>He must’ve thought he could tame us easily since we’re brats. You know, since if we like him enough, he might be requested for another job, right…?&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Why do you have to be so distrustful…</p><p>Though… we ended up talking about something else. I’m sorry.</p><p>So about those outfits—after you wear them for the Fashion Show, Izumi-san…</p><p>We were thinking if you’ll let us fix them up a little, so we could use them for the Spring Music Festival we’ll appear in.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Ah, that’s what you meant by sharing?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Yeah. Our Spring Music Festival also use musical instruments, which already cost a lot…</p><p>And because our appearance didn’t get decided until the last minute, it seems the budget doesn’t quite fit.</p><p>I know that’s because we were too slow on things, so we don’t have the right to complain.</p><p>But paying for costumes is really looking hopeless…</p><p>UNDEAD, who will appear with us, said they’re willing to shoulder the cost for us, but we’d like to avoid that…</p><p>That’ll make us entirely dependent on UNDEAD… We’ve seriously troubled those people to no end, we can’t be adding more to our debts to them.</p><p>So please, Izumi-san. Can you guys let us wear your outfits after you’re done?</p><p>The Fashion Show might become an advertisement for the Spring Music Festival, which is killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>Is it too much to ask…? It’s too convenient for us, huh?&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Yep. Seriously, you Trickstar are always like that…</p><p>Instead of prioritizing what you want to do, try thinking about the trouble you’re causing for people.</p><p>But maybe you guys are fine as you are—like main characters… Fufufu, that’s so fitting for you, Yuu-kun.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Umm, I wonder about that? I’m just a supporting role to the end; maybe an extra…”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “…Okay then. I accept the deal. But I have conditions.”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Ehh? Please don’t interfere while I’m talking; you’re always like that, Izumi-san…</p><p>Err wait, really? You’ll allow us to use your outfits?</p><p>Thank God♪ Transfer student-chan did say she’d guarantee Izumi-san would say OK if <em>I</em> went to convince him…</p><p>But I was still worried whether I could properly negotiate!&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;You’ve always been bad at talking, Yuu-kun.</p><p>Still, we’re no longer children… I guess I can’t be kind and give you everything unconditionally. I want to gain something from this too.</p><p>You understand, right? Bargain.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Y-Yeah… I’m a little scared, but try saying what it is.</p><p>I do hope it’s not going to be such a mean condition… but I’ll do anything within my power.</p><p>This is an important time for Trickstar. I can’t come to a deadlock here.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Of course you can’t… Hey, what should I do, Naru-kun? I’m such a lucky man☆</p><p>Yuu-kun just told me he’ll listen to anything! What should I do with him? Fufufu♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;You have the face of a villain, Izumi-chan…</p><p>Don’t act too much like degenerate, please. We’re in a delicate time too, since we’re in the middle of restoring our name.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “I know. It’s my fault Knights is having a hard time now. I feel enough remorse to fill the tip of the nail on my little finger.”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> “No, seriously, be more sorry about it… Sheesh, what a <em>darling</em> of an Onii-chan we have here…”</p><h3 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h3><p><strong>&gt; Hallway 1st Floor</strong></p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/c1PO7oG.jpg"></p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Ooi! Anzu-saaaaa…nggh!?</p><p>…What’s wrong? I wish you wouldn’t suddenly cover my mouth like that. I thought I was going to die. Since when did you learn such an assassin-like skill?</p><p>[How earth-shattering]! Interesting! It seems boys and girls <em>do</em> grow at an unbelievable speed when you’re not paying attention!</p><p>Which means they <em>change</em>! They adapt to the surrounding! You, too, are a living being, Anzu-san! Hahaha☆</p><p>Whoa, did you just hit me with a paper fan?</p><p>That’s another skill I’ve never seen! Bravo, bravo☆</p><p><em>‘Just be quiet please’</em>? OK, OK! I shall comply to your wish, Anzu-san♪</p><p>But still, Anzu-san… What are you trying to do, sneakily hiding in the shadows like that?</p><p>I won’t tell anyone about it, so you should consult Mama when you’re in trouble.</p><p>Actually… today is the Festival Eve, right? It can’t be all right for you to be wasting time at a place like this… What happened to your work, Anzu-san?</p><p>Well, you’re mainly producing for the school festival, which is tomorrow, but…</p><p>While you might not be that busy today, it doesn’t mean you’re <em>free</em>, right?</p><p>It seems you took in some extra work and were absorbed in it, Anzu-san.</p><p>I see. So you’re worried for Makoto-san because he’s been acting weird?</p><p>He would sneak out of Spring Music Festival practices sometimes and go somewhere?</p><p>That’s certainly a cause for curiosity, but Makoto-san is free to do whatever he wants, wherever he wants, right?</p><p>It doesn’t appear like you’re Makoto-san’s lover or family, either, so I think there’s limit to being meddlesome, Anzu-san.</p><p>Well, I know that Makoto-san is the type of child one can’t help but worry about.</p><p>Oh-hoh. So Makoto-san started acting weird after he was sent to negotiate with Izumi-san for the Festival Eve?</p><p>The negotiation was a success, but it looks like there was some kind of condition?</p><p>Since you were the one who forced Makoto-san to be the negotiator…</p><p>You think it’s your responsibility if Izumi-san was doing something bad to him, is that right, Anzu-san?</p><p>I don’t think Izumi-san will do anything bad, thooough…</p><p>But if you’re curious anyway, rather than taking this kind of detour, you should ask the person himself.</p><p>You made Makoto-san and Izumi-san come in contact because you believed it could be a chance to restore their relationship, right?</p><p>You should watch how things are going for now, and just take responsibility for whatever results your action fruited.</p><p>That’s a Producer’s role, isn’t it? It might be a different problem entirely if they asked for your help; but too much meddling is simply out of line.</p><p>Well, that is simply my opinion, and you have the freedom to think differently, Anzu-san.</p><p>Hahaha. So you’ll go ask Makoto-san, since you’re worried, after all?</p><p>You were such a clumsy kid, but now you’re already capable of acting like a guardian♪</p><p>Okaay then! I’ll go with you and deal with trouble if there’s any. I can prove to be pretty useful, y’knoow; you should work me hard as you see convenient… Producer.&quot;</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/cHxreZd.jpg"></p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;We’re here~ Let’s see, how are they doing?</p><p>Soon, it will be about time for the Fashion Show that Izumi-san and Arashi-san will appear in to commence.</p><p>After that, on the special stage set on the campus, the Spring Music Festival will start.</p><p>And there are lots other events of various sizes held around the campus, so the whole school’s gonna be a carnival! How fun! How festive! Hahaha♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “~…♪”</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> &quot;Oh, that’s Makoto-san. He’s looking like always; you might have been worrying over nothing, Anzu-saan…</p><p>He looks relaxed. That’s a good look on him.</p><p>But what is he doing? He’s playing tambourine…?&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Stop right there! Don’t make me repeat this, Yuu-kun!</p><p>More <em>stylishly</em>! You were so focused on hitting the tambourine, you ended up bending down! Straighten up that pathetic back!</p><p>Once more, from the top!</p><p>Today’s the day, so you’ve got to put more spirit into it! It always takes you <em>so</em> long to start up your engine, Yuu-kun! Aargh geez, this is frustrating me!&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Err… Izumi-san, are you done with your own rehearsal? One more hour and it’ll be time for the Fashion Show, you know?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Haah? You think I don’t keep track of my own schedule? Don’t make a fool out of me! Soooo annoying!</p><p>Of course I’m ready.

I’ll assist you while you’re still hopeless.</p><p>Be grateful. Feel indebted to me to death. Say thank you, Yuu-kun.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Right, right. Thank you very much~…</p><p>You’re really helping me. Honest.&quot;</p><h3 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h3><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Y9A7IJD.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;But I still don’t get it. Why did you make <em>looking after me</em> the condition of the bargain, Izumi-san?</p><p>I was in a stalemate kind of situation, so I’m saved that you’ll give me advice, but… I’m the only one profiting from this bargain, right?&quot;</p><p><strong>Madara:</strong> “Hahaha. That <em>stalemate</em> is probably a mistaken expression, but I guess what’s important is that it gets through♪”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “That surprised me!? Huh, it’s you, Mikejima-senpai… and Transfer student-chan! W-What’s up, you two?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Heeey you… Don’t just brazenly step in here, outsiders. Right now, this place is a holy sanctuary just for me and Yuu-kun alone.”</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;No, no. I’ve been here the whole time, okay? Soometimes… or more like whenever Yuuki-kun is around, you’ll just conveniently forget my whole existence, don’t you… Izumi-chan?</p><p>Talk about rude. It’s not in my character, but I might be jealous.</p><p>Oh my? Transfer student-chan, did you say I’m beautiful? Thank you~♪</p><p>Ufufu. Since I’m going to appear in the Fashion Show, I’ve changed into these clothes.</p><p>It does irritate me that I end up with the same design as Izumi-chan because of budget, though.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;You can do nothing about that, Naru-kun. Stop complaining already…</p><p>I’m unhappy with a lot of things too. I was forcing myself to accept it by telling myself it’s just a minor performance before the actual school festival.</p><p>Seriously, what’s a Fashion Show when there’s only a single new design? The rest are existing costumes from the warehouse.</p><p>They say fashion trends change within the span of a single second. And now I have to be wearing some outdated clothes that are covered in dust…</p><p>Noooo way. Don’t wanna.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Don’t say that, now. Your favorite designer said he’ll lightly touch up the old costumes to make them look new.</p><p>Let’s just work under those terms.</p><p>He’s willing to do extra work for no pay, after all. You have to be thankful, Izumi-chan.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Hmph, he loves to make people owe him, that designer… Well, we gave him trouble, and I do want to keep doing business with him.</p><p>He makes some really great outfits, after all.</p><p>There’s Kasa-kun who cheekily got worked up saying ‘<em>Why did you not tell me about this!?’</em> and willingly became our errand boy too.</p><p>One way or the other, this Fashion Show will be a success.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Ufufu. He must’ve been lonely to be left out of the loop, that Tsukasa-chan.</p><p>Now I wish we could’ve dragged Ritsu-chan into this too, but he’s been high-strung lately.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Hmph. What’s a guy like Kuma-kun doing acting like he has real worries? He wasn’t supposed to be that sort of character. He’s usually so apathetic it ticked me off.</p><p>Seriously, I wonder if something happened.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Ah, it seems there was something between him and Isara-kun…</p><p>Maybe they couldn’t be straightforward with each other and ended up fighting. It doesn’t feel right when the air around them is tight, so I wish they can make up soon.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Yeah, right? They could take a page from our book!”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Err no, it’s not like we made… up? It was always just you persistently bothering me, even back then…”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Haah? But you were the one who called out to me first.</p><p>Stop making everything my fault and acting like the only good kid!&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;Right, stop. Don’t start fighting too, you two… that’ll be a pain.</p><p>What’s in the past stays in the past and we’re in the present. The Fashion Show is starting soon. Get into work mode, okay? ♪</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;…I know. I’m a professional; I’ll give the show my all.</p><p>It’s a little late, but the designer who made these outfits will arrive at the scene soon, so we’ll have him make the last check.</p><p>Then all’s left is to do everything perfectly.</p><p>I was doubting how it’ll go at first, but it’s wrapping up pretty nicely. That’s a given though, when it revolves around me.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> &quot;There you go, even though you’re still a nervous wreck inside. But we can’t relax yet; no one can tell what might happen until the show.</p><p>Well, I’m sure it’s nothing you don’t already know, Izumi-chan.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Obviously. …Yuu-kun, you should reunite with your comrades too. If you keep sticking to me, won’t that cheeky orange-haired brat worry?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Orange-hair… Aah, you mean Akehoshi-kun?</p><p>Fufu. If Akehoshi-kun is wary around you, you deserve it, Izumi-san. It means what you did was really that bad~ I hope you’d reflect on it.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “Haah? It’s because I <em>am</em> reflecting on it that I helped you with such a cheap bargaining chip, you know? I could’ve made a muuuch nastier demand, do you realize?”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Fufu. But I really don’t understand why you made this the condition:</p><p>That I’ll have to do my practice for the Spring Music Festival in front of Izumi-san whenever possible.</p><p>Wasn’t it a bother, to have me playing tambourine so close to you? And you poked at my mistakes like there was no tomorrow, Izumi-san…</p><p>I was bothering you, right? I was in your way, wasn’t I?</p><p>Honestly though, for me, it’s a help that you gave me so many advice.</p><p>I got rid of most of the parts I was troubled with; I think I can proudly say I can give the Spring Music Festival my all.</p><p>But, still… I can’t imagine what was in it for you, Izumi-san.&quot;</p><p><strong>Arashi:</strong> “Ahaha. That’s a rather cruel question to make, you know… Yuuki-kun?”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;You know, Yuu-kun, why don’t you try using your head a bit? Work your brain so it won’t lose out to your pretty outside appearance, yeah…?</p><p>Well, they do say the gods don’t bestow two gifts to a single person.</p><p>You guys are going to use these outfits we present in the Fashion Show for your Spring Music Festival, right?</p><p>If you guys put up a pathetic performance there, all the trouble we went through to express the outfits’ charm will go to waste.</p><p>You produce miserable results, and that’ll affect us too.</p><p>Basically, don’t drag us down with you.</p><p>I don’t want you guys to turn our hard-earned results upside down… That’s all there is to it. So don’t misunderstand, okay?</p><p>Once the Fashion Show is over, we should be free, so… I’ll be seeing your stage.</p><p>Make sure to stay focused. If your performance is crap, know I’ll be there to throw rocks and empty cans at you guys.</p><p>So, well… do your best, Yuu-kun.</p><p>I might not be able to stand on the same stage as you. But Onii-chan is always watching over you, Yuu-kun.&quot;</p><h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2><p><strong>&gt; Band stage</strong></p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/9zbH9op.jpg"></p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “♪~ ♪~ ♪”</p><p>(All right~! Yes, yes! I’m doing good~♪</p><p>I’m managing to perform with my own charm, without being a burden to anyone!</p><p>Each time I hit the tambourine, the audience respond by moving their bodies!</p><p>They clap their hands to my tambourine’s melody!</p><p>This feeling of unity makes me so happy… Aah, live concerts really are fun.</p><p>Back when I was still in modeling, I couldn’t quite feel ‘united with everyone’ like this.</p><p>All I needed was to show the perfect beauty the cameraman sought from me.</p><p>And in that frame of beauty, I didn’t exist. My true self was buried under the vision everyone desired… fading away until there’s nearly nothing left.</p><p>Leaving only a beautiful shell with nothing inside.</p><p>But now, I know I’m getting slowly fulfilled on the inside too.</p><p>When I play the tambourine, everyone reacts. Spreading a ripple that comes back one-two hundred times stronger.</p><p>I’m filled with warmth. It lets me know—that I’m not just cutting off and selling pieces of myself and letting what’s inside flow out;</p><p>No, we’re bestowing warmth at each other. I can feel it overflowing out of me.</p><p>I love this feeling. I’m glad I became an idol.</p><p>But my talent or skill just can’t match up to everyone else yet…</p><p>They can play the trumpet and contrabass so well even though their time to practice was as short as mine…</p><p>They’re different from me. Sometimes, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the members of Trickstar and acting like one of them fill me with apologetic feelings…</p><p>But for as long as they allow it, I want to stay here. At least, until I could restore everything of me, that I lost as I bled.</p><p>I know I’ve been doing nothing but receiving from you guys.</p><p>But someday, once my inside was filled like how it was originally in the past… I’ll definitely start repaying you little by little.</p><p>This time, instead of having it forcefully dragged out of me—I want to offer it to you guys myself.</p><p>That might be hard to do now, but someday. Surely.</p><p>…Oops, I wasn’t concentrating, was I? I need to be on my guard and do this properly until the end. There’s still the last hurdle I mostly failed during practice.</p><p>Follow the rhythm… and hit the tambourine!</p><p><em>Stylishly!</em> I might still look pathetic, but this is the best I can do now!</p><p>I’ll form a melody and repay what you all have given me!</p><p>…♪)</p><p><strong>&gt; In front of the school gate</strong></p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ooi, Izumi-san! Are you on your way home?”</p><p><img alt="Imgur" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/MUfOs9t.jpg"></p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Hmm? Aah, Yuu-kun… Good work today.</p><p>I saw your stage on the Spring Music Festival.</p><p>I snuck out of Fashion Show’s cleanup to watch it, you see… Naru-kun really let me have an earful after that.</p><p>And by the way, Kuma-kun suddenly made an appearance in the Spring Music Festival like it’s normal? What’s up with that? You’ve got to explain it to me later.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Ahaha. I dunno, either. That took me by surprise too~ It’s apparently part of Sakuma-senpai’s plan though.</p><p>Rather than that, I wanted to thank you, Izumi-san.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Haah? I don’t need any thanks… I gave you advice because it was the condition of the bargain, Yuu-kun.</p><p>And whatever another person says can’t fix what you can’t do.</p><p>So, the fact that you were able to perform somewhat well on the Spring Music Festival… was all due to your own effort, Yuu-kun.</p><p>Right, right! I knew you can conquer anything if you try, Yuu-kun…♪&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Ahaha. Thank you. Even in the past, you were the only who would say that to me, Izumi-san.”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Fufu. Personally, I’d love to have you back as a model, Yuu-kun…</p><p>But you wouldn’t agree to participate on the Fashion Show to the end, so I guess you’re not up to it?&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;Yeah. Not now, at least. It’s still hard for me.</p><p>But someday, once my inside is filled… Someday, maybe I can return to modeling like you want me to, Izumi-san.</p><p>You really took care of me back when I was small, after all.</p><p>I know I need to at least repay that debt. But for now, I have my hands full with just my own problems, so I can’t do that yet.</p><p>But surely, someday. Before you, who’s still cutting off pieces of yourself and selling them, disappear…</p><p>I want to repay everything you’ve given me, Izumi-san.&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Don’t rely on a someday. Pay me back now.</p><p>You don’t know what’ll happen in the future. Even if we entwine our little fingers and promise… there’s no telling when even that’ll be treated like <em>something that never happened</em>.</p><p>I’ve had enough of that…</p><p>Hey, Yuu-kun.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> “Eek!? W-Why did you walk up to me like a slippery snake and grabbed my hand? A-Are you planning something strange? M-Mister Policemaaan!”</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;What do you take me for…? Yuu-kun, you’re going home now, right?</p><p>Let’s go together. Actually, Naru-kun, <em>that</em> designer… and Kunugi-sensei are going to have a little gathering, see…</p><p>We’ll be reviewing the Fashion Show today.</p><p>Review, we say, but basically, we’re celebrating for the show’s success. Even if you’ll go home earlier anyway, you should show your face for a bit, Yuu-kun.</p><p>As fellow models, there’s a lot we can talk about.</p><p>That designer was really worried about you… Tell him how you feel about your current life so he can relax.</p><p>I’d love to hear your stories too, Yuu-kun.</p><p>Let’s talk a lot. That’ll be enough to repay me—in my eyes, that’s the best reward ever.</p><p>Well, because I was on hiatus for a while too, I had some regrets about my performance in today’s Fashion Show…</p><p>I’m planning to hear out what they have to say and make the best use of it on my next job.</p><p>Though, well… I know Yuu-kun didn’t see my show, anyway.&quot;</p><p><strong>Makoto:</strong> &quot;No, I snuck out to see it on my breaks, you know?</p><p>It felt like you’d make me stand on stage if I got too close, so I was watching from afar.</p><p>You might be unsatisfied, Izumi-san, but you were perfect as always.</p><p>You’re so amazing… I was impressed. I wonder what I can do to be like you, Izumi-san?&quot;</p><p><strong>Izumi:</strong> &quot;Ahaha… Then I’ll kindly teach you from beginning to end.</p><p>So let’s go together, Yuu-kun. Let’s walk while holding hands, like when were both small.&quot;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><em>Other notes</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p><hr><section class="footnotes"><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>It’s some kind of yelling usually heard in sumo.
