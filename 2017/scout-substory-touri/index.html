school</strong></p><p><img alt="Morning Tranquility" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/oHsshSf.jpg"></p><p><strong>Adonis:</strong> (Hm.</p><p>The person walking in front of me… is that Anzu?</p><p>She’s quite early. I didn’t expect her to commute at the same time as me, who have morning practice in the Track and Field Club.</p><p>To sleep and wake up early is a necessary step to remain healthy.</p><p>But that mustn’t be it. She must be busy with the producer work. I heard that she also studies on her own initiative to catch up with the lectures.</p><p>That’s commendable of you, Anzu. Despite being so small… you’re always working hard everyday.</p><p>Poor thing. Her steps are unsteady, maybe due to her exhaustion. It’s hard to just stand and see. I wish I could rush to her side and support her, but…</p><p>I might surprise her if I suddenly call out to her from behind.</p><p>Apparently, I don’t have much of a presence. Anzu’s heart might stop if a giant like me suddenly towers her from behind.</p><p>As long as that possibility exists, I cannot call out to her.</p><p>But it bothers me. I cannot bring myself to leave her be.</p><p>I should stealthily follow after her. Maintain a close distance, so I can deal with anything that might happen, but also carefully, so she won’t notice me.</p><p>……</p><p>…I’m hungry.</p><p>My sisters do not eat in the morning. So I also do not cook breakfast.</p><p>I woke up a little late this morning, so I haven’t eaten anything, since I rushed out in a hurry.</p><p>Mmh. My stomach might growl any moment. This is not good; Anzu will notice me.</p><p>Hm? Anzu turned her head.</p><p>……</p><p>…Phew. I ended up hiding in my reflex. Good that there’s a stall at just the right place.</p><p>Anzu didn’t notice me, did she?</p><p>…Hm. This is a kebab stall. Perfect; I will have one as my breakfast.)</p><p>“Owner. Excuse me, give me a kebab.</p><p>I would be happy if you cut the meat thick.</p><p>…Hmm? No, I only need one portion. I do eat a lot, but I have a sports practice after this.</p><p>If I fill my stomach too much, I might throw up in the middle of my run.</p><p>And that will be unfortunate. I prefer what I ate to be processed into nutrition, without throwing it up.</p><p>I will eat meat, let my body absorb what it needs, so I can become stronger.</p><p>Mm? <em>‘I just wanted to know if you’re ordering for the young lady next to you too’</em>?</p><p>…Anzu. Since when did you get to my side? You lack presence, much more than I do.</p><p>So you noticed me tailing you. Ah yes, I <em>am</em> huge… so it seems I didn’t cover my tracks as well as I meant to. I will take care next time.</p><p>Yes, I thought I mustn’t surprise you…</p><p>So I hesitated to call out to you. Please believe when I say that I was not thinking anything untoward when I followed you.</p><p>Do you want some kebab?</p><p>Yes, sir. I know her. Give a kebab for her too.</p><p>Stuff in more meat. If that costs more, I will pay for it.</p><p>It’s alright, Anzu. It will be on me. It’s my apology for making you unsettled.</p><p>If you eat meat, become stronger, and cease to be scared of me… I will have less concerns when I approach you. I consider this an investment.</p><p>Does what I want to say translate properly?</p><p>Mm. There’s the kebab. It’s hot, so be careful, Anzu.</p><p>Eat kebab. The meat is yummy. (<em>munch</em>, <em>munch</em>)</p><p>Owner. That is wrong. We are not lovers.</p><p>I am an idol, and she is a producer. We are also classmates. Those are my relations with her.</p><p>Yes. Good if you understand. You make wonderful kebab.</p><p>Do you set up a stall here everyday? I will try to frequent here. This is good meat.</p><p>(<em>munch</em>)</p><p>What are you doing, Transfer student? Please do not suddenly touch the area around my lips. I almost ate your fingers alongside the kebab.</p><p>Mm. Right. I shouldn’t have spoken while eating. My mouth has gotten dirty, is it? So you wiped it with a handkerchief.</p><p>Thank you. …You don’t get scared easily, do you?</p><p>Maybe you are more tough than I thought you were. Next time, I will call out to you when I see you, without concerning over trivial matters.</p><p>Owner. She is not my older sister, nor is she my mother. Why are you sending her a heartwarming gaze, as if saying ‘<em>my, your son is such a handful’</em>?</p><p>I can’t comprehend. Still, this morning is more lively than usual.”</p><h2 id="hidaka-hokuto">Hidaka Hokuto</h2><h3 id="the-class-rep-and-the-homeroom-teacher">The Class Rep and The Homeroom Teacher</h3><p><strong>&gt; Infirmary</strong></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Excuse me.</p><p>Sagami-sensei. You weren’t in the faculty office, so I thought you might be here. Are you around?”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Zzz, zz…♪ “</p><p><img alt="Class Rep &amp;amp;amp; Homeroom" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Nhy4qes.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “He’s sleeping in like it’s the most natural thing, this lazy teacher…</p><p>Hey, the infirmary beds are for sickly students who need rest, not a nest for good-for-nothing lazybones, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Zzz, zz…♪ “</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “A sleeping face like a baby’s. From the looks of it, he probably just had a night of drinking.</p><p>I will be disciplining myself so I won’t be an alcohol addict like you in the future, Sensei.</p><p>However, I prefer that you do your job as a proper teacher too, instead of teaching us what we shouldn’t strive to be.</p><p>Get up, Sagami-sensei. There’s something I need to report. I want to get this done with and return to Trickstar’s lesson.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Zzz, zzz, zz…♪ “</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Mmph. He won’t wake up even when I shake him and slap his cheeks.</p><p>…No other choice, then. I should give that technique father taught me a try.</p><p><em>Targeting your heart and bang!☆ Here to deliver you the hit song of the Super Idol, Sagami Jin!</em></p><p>♪ *~*♪ ~♪</p><p>♪ ~♪ ~♪</p><p><em>Let me show you a wonderful dream, Princess…</em> <em>♪</em> <em>(suggestive glance)”</em></p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “…What are you trying to do, Hocchan?”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Don’t call me Hocchan.</p><p>…<em>’Jin-kun’s treating his past like a dark history he wants to forget, so if you hum his songs from back then, he’ll listen to whatever you say just so you’ll stop.’</em> This is what father taught me.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “God, stop that, the shame’s pretty mortifying to me… You’ve grown into an amusing character lately, huh? Sensei doesn’t know if he should praise you for that.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Praise me so I’ll grow.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “What’re you being so proud about? Well, good for you, I guess…</p><p>(<em>yawn</em>) Ah, I slept well♪ ”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Who said you could? You’re still on duty, Sagami-sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “It’s fine, it’s fine. I put up a notice here that says call for Kunugi-sensei or Anzu if I’m asleep, along with their contact numbers.</p><p>Even if there’s an emergency, those two should deal with it.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “And you’re okay with that? You’re going to lose your license one of these days, honestly.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Well, I have enough savings to last me for the rest of my life, even if I were to spend it playing around… To be perfectly honest, losing the job won’t hurt me in anyway.</p><p>But your later years get really boring when you’re not working, so I’m working because I have no choice.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “You’re not in your ‘later years’ yet. In fact, you’re at the age that’s often referred to as the prime working age, Sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Spare me the sermons.</p><p>All that aside, what’re you here for today…? You’re pretty much the model student for self-care, always keeping your health in check, so I doubt you’ll need anything in the infirmary.</p><p>What? Is it mental difficulties, adolescent concerns, one of those sort?</p><p>Spare me that. I know as a teacher I should be like, ‘_You’ll feel a lot better just opening up your worries to someone! Tell me anything_♪‘</p><p>But honestly, that kind of counseling burns out the listener too.</p><p>I do have qualification and experience as a counselor, so it’s not that I <em>can’t,</em> sure.</p><p>But whatever I say to fledgling idols like you, it’s all gonna come off as one of those condescending, anachronistic moral-lessons-from-my-boss often grumbled about in bars.</p><p>Your life belongs to you. Think for yourselves and set out your own path. Even the times you spend worrying and suffering are gonna be an experience you’ll treasure for life. Yep, yep.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Are you fleeing by saying whatever comes to mind? You don’t run out of methods to shirk from your duties, do you…</p><p>I didn’t come here for any counseling. There’s something I’d like to report, as a class rep.</p><p>The desks and chairs in our classroom, plus part of the lockers have gotten damaged due to age. If possible, please allocate some budget to replace them anew, or at least get them fixed.</p><p>Obviously I shouldn’t decide these things myself, so I’ve come to discuss them with you.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Ah~… This academy’s been around for a long time. Some things are gonna degrade.</p><p>The furnishings from back when I was in school’s still being used here and there.</p><p>But y’know, dealing with the documents are such a pain…</p><p>Just pretend nothing’s wrong and keep using those deteriorating furniture. Geez, you modern kids are so used to making expenditures for everything.</p><p>Aren’t old desks interesting, with all the scribbles from your alumni?</p><p>Feel the profoundness and transience in it.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “No. Get them fixed. It shouldn’t be that much problem for you, Sensei.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Okay, okay… I understand. It’s much more of a pain to keep arguing with you. You never move an inch from what you’ve decided.</p><p>Is that all you need? I’m gonna get another nap and deal with it when I wake up… so out you go. Good work as always, Class Rep.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. By the way, I have your statements recorded.</p><p>So there’s no use saying <em>‘So sooorry, I forgot!’</em> later. I can even win if you bring this to the court. My preparations are flawless.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Guh. Man, who’s this uncute brat…?</p><p>When you were little, you were a lovely baby who’d rub your squishy soft cheek against my face while pleading <em>‘Jin-kun, sing me a song♪</em> ‘”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “And back then you were the number one coolest super idol in the world, from every perspective.</p><p>…I <em>do</em> admire you, so please don’t show off your unimpressive sides too much.”</p><p><strong>Jin:</strong> “Sure, sure. …Don’t ever become like me, Hocchan.”</p><p><strong>Hokuto:</strong> “Yes. I won’t be like you, and I can’t.</p><p>I will become a far more impressive idol than you, Super Idol Sagami Jin.”</p><h2 id="shino-hajime">Shino Hajime</h2><h3 id="cute-grievances">Cute Grievances</h3><p><strong>&gt; Garden Terrace</strong></p><p><img alt="Hajime" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/NQT72qS.jpg"></p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Akehoshi-senpai has been distant lately.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Okay, no point in telling us that, Haa-kun…?”</p><p><img alt="Ritsu &amp;amp;amp; Eichi" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/igU2UEl.jpg"></p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “How very interesting.

You’re Kuma-kun, so you have bags – <em>kuma</em> – under your eyes…♪” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Lame… Wow, I can’t believe we’re closing into summer and the sheer lameness of your joke managed to give me the chills.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Fufu, you love puns, don’t you, President? The way you always say such witty things impresses me, as I’m bad at talking…♪”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Remember what I said about praising Ecchan too much is just inflating his ego?</p><p>Anyway, back to topic. So that Akehoshi guy has been cold to you lately, is it, Haa-kun?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Ah, no. It’s not that he’s been cold towards me.</p><p>But Akehoshi-senpai hasn’t been taking campus part time jobs lately, it seems. There’s been fewer and fewer chances for me to see him… I’m lonely.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Mn~ Trickstar’s been on the rise, so aren’t they just too busy for anything?”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “They must be, huh…?</p><p>He’s become much, much harder to approach than he used to. Even when I encounter him on the hallway, it can be hard to bring myself to say hello.</p><p>Until a while ago, he would give me a hug whenever we met, but nowadays, he just seems so preoccupied…</p><p>That even if we get to chat sometimes, he’ll just exchange a few words with me then go away.</p><p>I know someone like me shouldn’t wish to keep Akehoshi-senpai all to myself. But I can’t hide that it makes me lonely… I’m being so selfish.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Nuh-huh. Haa-kun, you’re too meek, so you can be more selfish like that once in a while.</p><p>Good kids who doubtlessly listen to whatever they’re told are sometimes considered a bore, you know.</p><p>Maa-kun’s the same type as you…</p><p>He can be so overly docile that I try to get a rise out of him sometimes, but whatever I say, he just laughs it all off. It’s so worrying.</p><p>Almost makes me wonder if I don’t actually matter to him…</p><p>And he used to be so cute, too~ Calling me like “Ricchan, Ricchan♪” and seeing only me.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “I’m back~♪</p><p>Fufu. It seems you two have a lot in mind, so I’ve prepared some herb tea to relieve your stress.</p><p>The have quite the unique aftertaste though, which may dampen the sweetness of your snacks, Ritsu-kun.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “It’s fine~ The quality of my sweets won’t get any less perfect just because of some tea Ecchan makes.</p><p>They can be eaten at any condition. They’re the masterpieces of a first-class patissiere – <em>me</em> ♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Sure, except you’re an idol and not a patissiere? Haven’t you been confusing the sort of character you are, recently?”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Shut up…</p><p>Anyway, Ecchan. You should give Haa-kun some kind of advice, too. Apparently my study in human psychology is lacking since I don’t understand.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. Then I’ll also share some of my wisdom.</p><p>If I remember correctly, Subaru-kun loves things that sparkle, doesn’t he?</p><p>How about decorating your uniform with colorful light bulbs from top to toe, then approach him while they shine? Surely he won’t be able to resist you.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “I see… That’s very helpful, President.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “No no, that’s just gonna make you look like a weirdo~…”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Fufu. But I meant it; it’s a lot of help. I realize now that just complaining that Akehoshi-senpai hasn’t been paying attention to me, complaining that I’m lonely, will get me nowhere.</p><p>The change needs to be from myself. I’ll have to work hard and appeal myself to him, so he would talk to me.</p><p>That’s what you wanted to say, right President…?♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “That’s absolutely right. You’re such a perceptive boy to be able to grasp the essence of things, Hajime-kun.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “No no. You’re <em>definitely</em> just making things up as you go, Ecchan. It’s written all over your face. You’re getting a kick out of this, even though Haa-kun is seriously troubled.”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Fufu. But I can’t help being so pleased that my head refuses to work like usual…</p><p>After all, Hajime-kun just put his faith in us and revealed his worries.</p><p>It’s such an honor to know you’ve opened your heart to me.</p><p>If anything ever troubles you again in the future, feel free to rely on me.”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “And on me. You’re always taking care of me, Haa-kun, and as your upperclassman in the Tea Club… as the older guy, your Onii-chan, I’m willing to look after you too.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Thank you very much. I’m very happy; I must be so blessed…♪</p><p>All right! I’ll work hard. First of all, the next time I see Akehoshi-senpai, I’ll immediately light up my lightstick!</p><p>Out of all my possessions, this gives off the most sparkle…☆”</p><p><strong>Ritsu:</strong> “Right, thanks to <em>a certain someone</em>, your effort’s gone off to a weird direction, but go for it anyway~…♪”</p><p><strong>Eichi:</strong> “Yes, I also support you from the heart, Hajime-kun.”</p><p><strong>Hajime:</strong> “Thank you very much~! Ehehe, it’s like I’ve really gained reliable older brothers…♪”</p><hr><section class="footnotes"><ol><li>If I didn’t make it obvious enough, <em>kuma</em> can mean bags under eyes. <a href="#fnref1">↩</a></li></ol></section></div><footer class="post-footer"><div class="post-tags"><a href="/tags/Akira/" rel="tag"># Akira</a> <a href="/tags/ES-Substory/" rel="tag"># ES-Substory</a> <a href="/tags/ES-Summer/" rel="tag"># ES-Summer</a></div><div class="post-nav"><div class="post-nav-item"><a href="/2017/kiseki2-revenge-match/" rel="prev" title="★1710EV-MAIN2 | Revenge Match"><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i> ★1710EV-MAIN2 | Revenge Match</a></div><div class="post-nav-item"><a href="/2018/kiseki3-ss/" rel="next" title="★1801EV-MAIN2 | SS">★1801EV-MAIN2 | SS <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></footer></article></div></div></div><div class="toggle sidebar-toggle"><span class="toggle-line toggle-line-first"></span> <span class="toggle-line toggle-line-middle"></span> <span class="toggle-line toggle-line-last"></span></div><aside class="sidebar"><div class="sidebar-inner"><ul class="sidebar-nav motion-element"><li class="sidebar-nav-toc">Table of Contents</li><li class="sidebar-nav-overview">Overview</li></ul><div class="post-toc-wrap sidebar-panel"><div class="post-toc motion-element"><ol class="nav"><li class="nav-item nav-level-2"><a class="nav-link" href="#otogari-adonis"><span class="nav-text">Otogari Adonis</span></a><ol class="nav-child"><li class="nav-item nav-level-3"><a class="nav-link" href="#morning-tranquility"><span class="nav-text">Morning Tranquility</span></a></li></ol></li><li class="nav-item nav-level-2"><a class="nav-link" href="#hidaka-hokuto"><span class="nav-text">Hidaka Hokuto</span></a><ol class="nav-child"><li class="nav-item nav-level-3"><a class="nav-link" href="#the-class-rep-and-the-homeroom-teacher"><span class="nav-text">The Class Rep and The Homeroom Teacher</span></a></li></ol></li><li class="nav-item nav-level-2"><a class="nav-link" href="#shino-hajime"><span class="nav-text">Shino Hajime</span></a><ol class="nav-child"><li class="nav-item nav-level-3"><a class="nav-link" href="#cute-grievances"><span class="nav-text">Cute Grievances</span></a></li></ol></li></ol></div></div><div class="site-overview-wrap sidebar-panel"><div class="site-author motion-element" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><img class="site-author-image" itemprop="image" alt="kotofucius" src="https://image.ibb.co/cPxHhz/kotoava6.gif"><p class="site-author-name" itemprop="name">kotofucius</p><div class="site-description" itemprop="description"></div></div><div class="site-state-wrap motion-element"><nav class="site-state"><div class="site-state-item site-state-posts"><a href="/archives/"><span class="site-state-item-count">34</span> <span class="site-state-item-name">posts</span></a></div><div class="site-state-item site-state-categories"><a href="/categories/"><span class="site-state-item-count">104</span> <span class="site-state-item-name">categories</span></a></div><div class="site-state-item site-state-tags"><a href="/tags/"><span class="site-state-item-count">26</span> <span class="site-state-item-name">tags</span></a></div></nav></div><div class="links-of-author motion-element"><span class="links-of-author-item"><a href="https://twitter.com/kotofucius" title="Twitter → https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kotofucius" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-twitter"></i>Twitter</a></span></div></div><div class="back-to-top motion-element"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i> <span>0%</span></div></div></aside><div id="sidebar-dimmer"></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-inner"><div class="copyright">&copy;
