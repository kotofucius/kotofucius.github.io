Good that I decided to watch her just in case.</p><p>That freak is solving all the riddles hidden in the library. I’ve reached the right answer once myself, so I can tell.</p><p>If this continues on, she might find out the Phantom of the Library’s true identity.</p><p>Geez, this is what I meant! That’s why I said we should’ve hidden away all the books with the riddles!</p><p>We should minimize the number of people who know the secret! There’s no real way to button someone’s lip, after all!</p><p>Riddles are written inside the letters hidden in certain books in this library…</p><p>By solving all of them, you’ll be able to guess who the Phantom of the Library really is.</p><p>Fine if she can read the mood and turn a blind eye…</p><p>But if she exposes the truth to everyone for her amusement, it’s the end! Heroes of justice are supposed to keep their identity secret!</p><p>W-What do I do? Should I consult President Shion?)</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “……?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> (Eek!? She looked at me! It couldn’t be; I’m supposed to be well-hidden in the shades of the bookshelves!)</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/tyasnd0.jpg"></p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Yun, yun.</p><p>You are…”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> (…!? The smartest thing in a pinch is to retreat!)</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Ah, wait… You couldn’t possibly be…”</p><p>(Yun, yun. Aah, I guess it’s another miss.</p><p>The bizarre, the mysterious, the occult… Simply a sham? A trick? An imitation?</p><p>No. As long as there’s even the slightest possibility that a true abnormality exists, I won’t give up. Let’s search around a bit more… I have disgustingly plenty of time to kill anyway.</p><p>Studying, love, sports… youth. Use your time for such valuable things, says everyone in society.</p><p>But. As someone who should never have been born, whatever I decide to waste my life, to kill time doing… I doubt anyone would bat an eyelash.</p><p>Yun, yun.)</p><p><strong>&gt; Newspaper Clubroom</strong></p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “President Shion~! We have trouble!</p><p>S-Someone’s solving all the riddles in the library! She’s reached the final riddles in just the span of a few days, even though it took me months to do it!</p><p>If this keeps up, she’ll come in touch with us today the fastest! We need a counter plan! W-What do we do? What are we supposed to do, President Shion~!?”</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/GRaiw1q.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “(<em>gulp</em>) …Phew.</p><p>Aah, this tea is delicious.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Geh, Red Oni! Why are you here!?</p><p>The Newspaper Club room is a love nest for President Shion and I! Get out of here!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “…Don’t snap at me like that. How obnoxious.</p><p>It’s not like I chose to be here, either. The weather is clear today; I would rather play tennis outside.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Then get outside! Get out! Demons out, luck in~!</p><p>Let me throw at you these beans Grandpa gave me as snacks! They’re sugar coated and yummy, by the way!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Hey, don’t play with food!”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eek!? I got countered with a sound argument…!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Sheesh. Pipe down with all the quacking already. I’m not a real oni, but if you keep that up, I might wrap you like a manjuu and pop you into my mouth, you want that?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eeek! Don’t eat me! You’re scary! Save me, President Shion~!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “…Goodness.</p><p>Okay, so Fumi-san, is it? I was simply asked to watch the place for Shion-san… I’m not an intruder or anything, so I wish you wouldn’t be so cautious around me.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eh, watch the place? Is President Shion away?</p><p>I-I wonder if she’s on the rooftop again. Guh~ President Shion’s been engrossed with the Banchou lately.</p><p>President Shion – maybe it’s because she has a frail body, but she immediately takes a liking to strong people!</p><p>Maybe I should start training my muscles! I have to be President Shion’s number one!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Haha. That’s true. All day long… spent on reading, that can’t be good for your health. You don’t build muscles in a day, but…</p><p>If you want to do sports, how about joining our Tennis Club? Maybe it’s because I’m too harsh on them, but the members keep dropping, and that’s got me troubled.</p><p>I don’t really care about other people, but lack of members means our club budget will be cut, too… And we can’t participate in group competitions. It’s all sorts of inconvenient.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “L-Like I care about that! Just get out! The air feels heavier when you’re around!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “I can see I’m not welcome. I thought the Phantom of the Library is supposed to help students in need?</p><p>I’m in need of club members right now~ Why don’t you help a girl out?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Ah, right. For some reason, you’re in the know of the Phantom of the Library’s true identity, aren’t you…? Don’t tell anyone about it, okay?</p><p>Anyway, we’re not exactly philanthropic charity here! We decide who we want to help!</p><p>And you’re capable of solving all your troubles yourself, aren’t you!?”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Fair enough. At the end of the day, I’m all I have… I’m just thinking, the Phantom of the Library either has a lot of free time or a quirky hobby to do this stuff on will.</p><p>Anyway, if you need Shion-san for something, I can go and call her for you. I wanted to move my body, and you don’t seem to like me staying here.</p><p>Godsent idea, right? What do you think?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “U-Uuh~? T-Then call her for me! Tell her it’s an emergency, okay?</p><p>Me, I’ll go prepare snacks for President Shion…♪”</p><p>(Aah, I want to talk with President Shion, quick! I want her to blow away all my worries!</p><p>But… I can’t rely on her too much, right…? President Shion has a brilliant mind, so she always gives me the best advice; but she’s helping me out of goodwill.</p><p><em>I’m</em> the Phantom of the Library. I have to do something about this with my own power.)</p><h3 id="2">/ 2</h3><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “I’ll be off to get Shion-san, then.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Yes! I’m counting on you, Red Oni!</p><p>The deadline for the school newspaper is near, come to think of it; I’ll be writing my manuscript while I wait!</p><p>I need to polish it to a good enough state before President Shion reads it♪”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “…Are the Newspaper Club’s articles all written by you, Fumi-san?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Not really all of them? I write most of them, sure, but depending on how it goes, President Shion would revise most of it and turn it into something else, see?</p><p>But this corner for serialized haiku is something President Shion writes from scratch.</p><p>If you read just the first letters, or use some deciphering method, it’ll turn into an entirely different thing.</p><p>It transforms into a content that either criticizes the teachers, or supports those Troublemakers!</p><p>Nooo one notices, though. She’s so cool~♪”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Are you sure you should tell me that? You’ll be in trouble if they know about your criticism of the teachers and such, right?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eh? Ah… I shouldn’t have said it! Keep it a secret! Forget about it!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “No, I’m no machine, so I can’t forget what I just learned so easily.</p><p>Well, no matter… Anyway, I didn’t know Shion-san liked haiku.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Hmm… I think it’s not haiku she likes, but wordplay.</p><p>Encrypting, matching words or letters… President Shion seems to be skilled at that sort of thing, and likes it as much.</p><p>But you know, that’s closer to calculations than literature. I personally wish President Shion would write articles normally.</p><p>In literature, you can feel the writer’s emotion. I want to know more about President Shion.</p><p>Anyway, stop the talking and just go! I can’t concentrate and write my manuscript if someone else’s around!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Sure, sure. Bye, then. Thanks for the tea… See you later, Fumi-san♪”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Hmph, don’t you dare come again! Pweh-pweh! You’re banned from the Newspaper Club! And most of all, I don’t want you reading our articles before they’re published!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “It’s not like I’ll tell anyone what I read. I don’t really have friends… people to share thoughts with.</p><p>…Well, whatever. I’ll see you, then. Bye bye♪”</p><p><strong>&gt; Corridor</strong></p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/l6E70Uj.jpg"></p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> (Goodness… Now I can finally go to my club.</p><p>I might’ve been too stressed lately. The other members kept dropping out because of me, so I got too heated.</p><p>I need to show results, to make up for the kids who gave up. I’m being shameful like this; at least I need to make a face like I’m having the time of my life.</p><p>That’s the only way I can compensate… and it’s also how I take revenge on those who abandoned my beloved tennis as soon as things didn’t go their way.</p><p>Actually, I just noticed this, but… Because I strained myself too much during practice… Could Shion-san have asked me to watch over the club room for her so I could rest?</p><p>I didn’t ask her to care; and that’s too roundabout of her… If she’s worried, she should’ve said that like a normal person. What a difficult girl, for crying out loud.)</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “……”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> (Hmm? Is that a girl crouching over there?</p><p>I wonder what’s wrong with her… But, it doesn’t concern me, I guess.)</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “(<em>mumbling</em>) …I thought the sound reverberated in a weird way – someone must have modified the space where the fire protection equipment should be.</p><p>Pushing the emergency button opens up a secret path… Fu, fufufu♪ I wonder where it leads?</p><p>From the trick, I would guess this is those Troublemakers’ doing, though… Those naive goofballs.</p><p>So this is no mystery. Something realistic: a prank?”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Oooi?”</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/YPSe85Q.jpg"></p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…What is it? Don’t talk to me.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Well, you’re blocking the path, and the way you’re crouching, I thought you might be feeling unwell.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…Hmm, I see. So you’re purely worried for me? I can tell.</p><p>Thank you for caring. But I’m fine.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Really, now. That’s great then… Sorry for bothering you. Bye.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Wait.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Uhya!? W-What? Don’t suddenly grab my nape, that sent a chill down my spine! You have such cold hands, huh?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Really? Really… I didn’t know. I never touched someone else.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Nah, it could be my temperature was just hot. That’s my cell metabolism working, fufufu♪ ”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Whatever.</p><p>Anyway, I heard you were called the Red Oni. Why is that?</p><p>What does the oni part translate to, in your case? Spirit, like the original Chinese… in other words, the literal meaning of the kanji? Symbolistic of your rebellious nature? Or are you really some kind of bizarre creature?”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “No, just a nickname.</p><p>It seems I’m often called the Red Oni by tennis players from other schools. The Newspaper Club found it funny and made an article out of it.</p><p>My body is somewhat trained, I look intimidating, and I’m as strong as a demon in tennis… So they just tease me for it, you know? Look, I don’t have any horns.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Oh, what… that’s boring.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “You don’t come across interesting things that easily. It’s not going to come rolling to your feet. How about taking a walk outside since the weather is so clear?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “You’re like my mother… Unfortunately, I can’t accept your idea.</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/wlvKlt6.jpg"></p><p>It’s full of noises outside.

How rare to see you on the rooftop~!</p><p>Nyahaha~ I’m lonely because we never talk despite being in the same class, y’see.</p><p>Maririn, you always rush out of class for club as soon as class ends♪”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Ahaha. We don’t need to be at school to meet; we could talk anytime whenever the local bigwigs gather for meetings. You haven’t been showing up lately though, Gin-san.</p><p>Thanks to that, I‘ve only ever been talking with the elderly, since no one my age was around.</p><p>I think it’s influencing my mannerisms and speech; I’m getting more and more like a grandma myself.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> &quot;Nyahaha~♪ You were always such a grown-up, Maririn!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “You, on the other hand, never stop being so childish, Gin-san… Only your body keeps maturing.</p><p>You should learn to be more elegant; you’re the next head of the Sanjou house, aren’t you?”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Why, I’m just a vulgar mountain-monkey through-and-through, y’see!</p><p>Anyway, don’t bring up my house~ I’m planning to fake innocence about that stuff while I’m in high school!</p><p>My freedom is gone for good once I graduate, after all~ Gotta enjoy my youth while I can! Nyahaha~♪”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Is that so? But I suppose that would be difficult to do, in Kimisaki Academy. It’s a suffocating college-prep school, after all.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Not quite true, y’see! I’m in the middle of playing with everyone on the rooftop right now!</p><p>Children will make a playground out of any place in the world~ I’m a child so I’ll have a good fill of a fun youth myself☆</p><p>By the way, we’re playing hide-and-seek today! The girls have spread out and hide all around the school, so I’m gonna find ‘em all quick and eat ‘em up! Since I’m the oni! Gaaaoo☆</p><p>You’re called Red Oni, aren’t you, Maririn? As fellow oni, won’t you help me find everyone?</p><p>We’ve got more girls taking shelter on the rooftop lately. There’s too many of them for me to find alone!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Nah, I have my club…</p><p>And anyway, don’t you start calling me Red Oni too, Gin-san. It’s making me sad; am I really that scary?”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Nyahaha~☆ The human brain is made to categorize others based on labels, no helping it!</p><p>I started getting called Banchou lately too, y’know?</p><p>I didn’t know what Banchou meant, so I asked this braided girl who has been visiting the rooftop often lately~</p><p>Since she always has her face buried in books and looks like the knowledgeable sort♪</p><p>And then, y’see? Apparently, Banchou is something like the guardian of the school!</p><p>If that’s what they’re asking from me, then what choice do I have besides exerting my best efforts? And being put in a position where I can protect everyone is just what I wish~!</p><p>Unfortunately for Maririn, you’re stuck with a monster’s name like Red Oni, though!</p><p>But hey, look at the bright side. It means you can be friends with other monsters!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “You sure are positive, Gin-san… Forget monster friends, I haven’t found a need for human friends. Ultimately, I can play tennis by myself, anyway.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Aren’t there tag teams and such? No idea, though! Nyahaha☆”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Hmm~ That aside, the braided girl you mentioned earlier… Were you talking about Shion-san?”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Right, right! That’s the name! Shion-chan!</p><p>She was among the rooftop girls before I knew it; when I first saw her, I thought she was a ghost or something!</p><p>I mean, she’s always in the shades, and she’s wearing the old-fashioned uniform from back when the old school building was in use, y’know?”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Hmm, so Shion-san really snuck among the rooftop residents. I wonder what that child is trying to do…</p><p>I can’t even guess; but you should be careful, Gin-san.</p><p>That girl, she smells like troubles… Befriending her won’t get you anywhere good.</p><p>Before you know it, you’ll find yourself moving just as she desires. It gives me the creeps… not that we should badmouth her like this.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Nyahaha~♪ I know what you’re trying to say, but I feel happier ending up nowhere good by befriending her, than not having anything to do with her at all!</p><p>I would rather feel hatred and pain than apathy!</p><p>Maririn too, you’re free to punch me when your stress builds up! Give me a deadly pain~☆ I welcome you anytime, nyahaha!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “I’m not going to punch you. Word of violence would ban me from competitions, and I don’t want that.</p><p>But how tiring. I heard Shion-san was on the rooftop… but you are all playing hide-and-seek? Does that mean I’ll have to look for her?”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Ah, no worries! Leave it to Gin-chan☆ I have a connection with this kid who knows everything about the school; if we ask her, we might find Shion-chan in no time!</p><p>Hello, is this the library warden? It’s Sanjou Gin-chan☆”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Library… Are you talking to the rumored Phantom of the Library?”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Yeah, yeah. Like you, Maririn, she’s given a monster’s name… Things happened and we’ve been getting along since.</p><p>I can only speak to her over the phone, and she camouflages her voice with a voice changer, so who knows what she looks like~ Well, I have a guess, though.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Gin-san, you’re sharp despite your carefree looks, after all… Like a blade, really.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Hey, don’t go calling a girl like a blade! That doesn’t sound like a compliment!</p><p>Say it more like, ‘You’re like a flower’! Or ‘You’re like a fairy’, come on~♪”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “No way. Where would you find a fairy who looks as tough as you?”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Nyahaha… Ah, hello, is that you from the Library? Sorry for the sudden call! I’m searching for this girl called Shion-chan; have any idea where she could be?</p><p>…Huh? What’s with the sudden coughing fit~? Are you sick?</p><p>Nyahaha. Usually, you’d know what I wanted to ask beforehand and ramble on. It’s rare to hear you being flustered~ It makes you feel more human; I’m happy♪</p><p>Hmm? I see, OK OK! Maririn, seems like Shion-chan is on the stairway landing right below the rooftop!”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “I see. Sorry for making you go through all that trouble. You‘re a help’.”</p><p><strong>Gin:</strong> “Hey, it’s okay. Let’s help each other in times of need♪”</p><h3 id="4">/ 4</h3><p><strong>&gt; Stairway landing</strong></p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Shi~on-san?</p><p>Hmm?

I thought you were some kind of earthbound spirit, or something~ And your panties are in full view.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “I’m not wearing anything that can’t be shown to other people.</p><p>I was actually hiding inside the locker, you see. But I felt appearing from there would be lacking impact from a performance standpoint, so I took all that trouble climbing on top of it.</p><p>By the way, I was hiding because I was in the middle of a game of hide-and-seek.</p><p>The darkest place is under the candlestick; I doubt the oni could guess I was right near the starting line.</p><p>It’s too much trouble to run around the school grounds to hide, anyway. It feels stupid to take this too seriously… and I don’t particularly mind being found quickly.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “You don’t seem to have enthusiasm for anything, Shion-san.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Unlike you, I do not have so much stamina at my disposal. I am a frail literary girl. I need to be efficient with my energy usage.</p><p>That being said–I could guess what you came to me for. I only need to return to the Newspaper Club room, right? Yet again, it appears Midori-kun has brought us another trouble.</p><p>By the way, I set up listening devices around the school and have informants all over the place.</p><p>Hence, I can read most of the tales woven inside Kimisaki Academy like an open book.</p><p>Still–I wouldn’t expect less. Midori-kun… the protagonist I chose. From one to the next, she keeps attracting new developments.”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Hmm… You shouldn’t treat her too much like a plaything. It’s somewhat agonizing just looking at you… tricking an innocent, good girl like that.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Ah, but it’s instinct to want to pollute something beautiful… I would prefer you correct your wording that I treat her like a plaything, though.</p><p>I love her dearly, and I am granting all of her dreams.</p><p><em>She</em> was the one who said she wanted to become a protagonist – a special existence.</p><p>As a reader, I help her promote her status as a character, and make the story more interesting.</p><p>When you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. He who fights with monsters become a monster himself. Writer and reader… an author and their fan are no different, Hanaoka-kun.</p><p>It is an exchange of mutual understanding and love. She spins a tale, and I let her know my impressions as a reader. She uses that as encouragement to weave her next tale.</p><p>That will continue for eternity. A beautiful circle, an eternal loop. I am content; I’m glad to have met that girl.</p><p>Reality was so so so boring… I was so tired of it, but she opened the curtains to a wonderful tale.</p><p>Let us applaud. Anyone would want to touch and kiss the author of the tale they dearly love, yes?</p><p>Fortunately, that is possible in my case. And needless to say, I shall indulge in this chance. I’ll suck it dry, for her story belongs to me alone.</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/xMgfu7x.jpg"></p><p>I won’t let anyone interrupt my reading.”</p><p><strong>&gt; Newspaper Clubroom</strong></p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Hmm~…?</p><p>No good… I can’t come up with the next scene…</p><p>I’m doing my best since the Newspaper Club’s serialized short story has been received so favorably, but unlike Grandpa, I don’t have talent.</p><p>I wonder how Grandpa could come up with so many unpredictable twists like that?</p><p>His characters all feel so alive too; you get naturally attached to them just by watching them.</p><p>I love Grandpa so much that he influences my literary style, but…</p><p>It feels like I’m becoming a sham. What does my writing lack?</p><p>It’s the super important resolution arc. I want to write it properly~ But simply having the Phantom of the Library ramble on about the truth is boring.</p><p>I mean, it’s the climax.

There’s something I wanted to consult to you about! Give me an advice like always, President Shion!”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Of course… I have already given you an advice, you know. Listen to what people tell you.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Huh? Ah, the school newspaper, the 25th edition… was it?”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “23rd. 2-3 can be read as Fumi too, yes? Don’t you think it’s like destiny?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Yes! It’s wonderful, President Shion♪</p><p>Let’s see, the newspaper’s past logs…? Ah sheesh, I should’ve properly collected them into scrapbooks!”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Fufu. We do lack helping hands. Perhaps we should recruit new members.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eeeh~… I want to be alone with you, President Shion. I don’t need a new member who’s better than a trash writer like me.</p><p>I feel like you’d abandon me, President Shion.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “You jest. I can’t think of a life without you, Midori-kun.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “R-Really? I see… Ehehe, I feel the same way!

The serialized short story is… it’s the chapter where a troublesome journalist tried to investigate the truth of the Phantom of the Library!</p><p>That’s awesome! I really didn’t need to say anything… My worries are like an open book to you, President Shion♪</p><p>Fufu. For the 23rd edition, I wrote as you told me and made up some great bullshit to sound like the truth.</p><p>Since this method provides a red herring, it might keep people from noticing the Phantom of the Library’s true identity.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Although I’ll argue you made it look forced. Midori-kun, you lack sensitivity for balance. Show, don’t tell; learn the skill to sneak hints between the lines.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Eeeh~… But isn’t it good to be easy to understand? As a text to read.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Reading too deeply into the text is the thrill of literature, Midori-kun.</p><p>Anyway, look. Doesn’t the 23rd edition of the short story contain a suggestive line?</p><p>Build from that and claim it’s foreshadowing. Developments to bloom in the future are the seeds buried in the layers of the past; they bud on the soil that is the present.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Huh? What do you mean? W-Which line were you talking about?”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “This one. Look, can you tell?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “H-Hyaa… President Shion, your braid is on my neck, it tickles♪”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “I can guess. These make me feel hot as well; I suppose it’s about time for a haircut.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “You can’t. Everyone will find out that how beautiful you actually are, President Shion.</p><p>The only one who can get this close and see your real face… The only one who knows your beauty should only be me♪</p><p>Ehehe. Maybe I should braid my hair like you do, President Shion♪</p><p>We’ll look like friends with matching hairstyles… But the way my hair is, my braids get undone easily.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Midori-kun. Isn’t there something you should be more concerned about than hairstyles, right now?”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Ah, right. I’m no good, aren’t I? I keep getting distracted from what I have to do… I’m just a dummy without President Shion looking after me.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “That’s not true. You should have more faith in yourself, Phantom of the Library-kun♪”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “E-Ehehe… But it’s like a dream. That I could act like the main character of a story. It’s all thanks to you, President Shion.</p><p>Hehe. The serial in the school paper actually bases its plot on real happenings in the school.</p><p>The teachers who aren’t the least bit interested in the children’s situation might have no idea, but any student can tell with a glance.</p><p>And there, I wrote in a fictitious character… the protagonist I thought of, the Phantom of the Library. A hero of justice whose existence is limited to the story; a phantom.</p><p>Then using the content of the serial as the base, I intervene and twist reality. Basically, I do what the Phantom of the Library did in the story.</p><p>That way, everyone will see the illusion of my protagonist. The magic to turn reality into a tale–this is my greatest pleasure as a writer♪”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “It’s essentially a one-man show, though. Not much different than what a conman does.</p><p>Humans live inside their episodic memories. We interpret, absorb, and read reality as if it was a fiction centered on us.</p><p>And there, you wrote in the Phantom of the Library, a character that doesn’t truly exist.</p><p>Because her story always fits with what happen in reality, few would catch onto the fact she is fictional.</p><p>Wonderful. To be both the authoress and the protagonist fulfill all the ego in a human. You are currently experiencing that philosophical ideal.</p><p>You were the author who created the fictitious hero Phantom of the Library, who wrote her tale… But you were also the very protagonist realizing the actions portrayed in the story into reality.</p><p>I would even say I’m envious, Midori-kun. Continue your good work; I have expectations for your next tale… as your loyal fan♪”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Thank you. I’ll work hard so I won’t disappoint you, my reader, President Shion♪</p><p>But it’s looking a little dangerous this time… There’s this freak investigating about the Phantom of the Library.</p><p>Solving the riddle on the letter hidden in ‘Phantom of the Opera’ book from the library leads to another book with riddle.</p><p>But these riddles can’t be solved unless you actually read the books. So with each riddle, you’ll end up having to actually read a classic.</p><p>Solve all the riddles, and you’re already a bona fide literary girl. And here I thought I was about the only one capable of solving all those difficult riddles.</p><p>I can only say this because it’s over, but… I was having such a difficult time with the riddles so I cried to my Grandpa and had him think with me, you know? Was this against the rules?”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “No. Intelligence, physical strength, luck and human relationship–all of these count as your own power. Think of having such a remarkable master author near you as good fortune… but still, this is quite troubling.</p><p>I do not know if you were just <em>that</em> out of ideas, but… the chapters of your serial have ben mostly named after the titles of the books with the riddles.</p><p>The first chapter, Phantom of the Library, was of course based on Phantom of the Opera.</p><p>Normally, if one solves all those riddles… they’ll come to the conclusion that the writer of the serial and the creator of the riddles are related.</p><p>That my name comes out at the last riddle is also a problem.</p><p>Anyone who wants to investigate the Phantom of the Library will definitely come in touch with me.</p><p>After all, originally, I simply wanted to have a literary discussion with any girl who read through all the books with the riddles–which were books of my choice.”</p><p><strong>Fumi:</strong> “Hmm~ Well, it’s not too late, so… we can take out the riddle from the last book, or borrow that book from the library to get rid of it?</p><p>Then at the very least, that freak won’t come in touch with you, President Shion.</p><p>The Newspaper Club’s relation is probably obvious already, so she might still come to our clubroom though.</p><p>We can only fake innocence… I’m the Phantom of the Library. I started this. I don’t want to involve you, President Shion.</p><p>I know that’s not very convincing when I’ve had you giving me advice all this time, though.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Your feelings make me happy–but you’re being distant, Midori-kun.</p><p>You and I, we are partners in crime… I do not wish to leave you alone to be dragged into a pot of troubles.</p><p>I shall aid you, so do your best to overcome this problem. Don’t worry; I know you’re capable of it.

Well, those who aren’t fans wouldn’t find it interesting. This is the final book with the riddle.</p><p>It is as hard to read as a dictionary, but you’ll have to examine every word to solve the last riddle. If you can go that far, you’ll be worthy of the title of the most leisurely person on earth.</p><p>I thought I might be able to make friends, if it’s with someone like that. And as a matter of fact, that’s how I met Midori-kun… It was all a matter of chances and luck, I brag.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…What do you need?”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Ah, yes. Discussions are normally banned from the library, but seeing as there is no one to scold us, why don’t we break that rule, yes?</p><p>Rumors had it if you make a racket here or treat the books without care, the Phantom of the Library will kill you.</p><p>Fufu. Well, people were so lacking in manners, that I couldn’t help but spread such a ghost story… It was my miscalculation that the fear ended up chasing them away from the library entirely, though.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “The Phantom of the Library doesn’t exist. Rather, it’s a fictitious existence you guys… the Newspaper Club made up, isn’t it?</p><p>You made me expect. I thought it was a true ghost story, a profound mystery. Like Hanako-san of the toilet, or kuchisake-onna… I thought it was one of such urban legend.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Because we followed the formula. Urban legends are spread through word-of-mouth, giving them a sense of reality people find easier to believe.</p><p>Not a ghost story woven from times past, but a meme spreading from person to person.</p><p>I wanted as many people as possible… to read the story Midori-kun spins. Because that is her wish. No; it’s the wish of all writers.</p><p>Though personally, I do wish to monopolize her story, all for myself.”</p><p><img alt="Grimoire" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/zTGCFIv.jpg"></p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “Right. A story. A made-up tale… It’s nothing bizarre. It’s nothing mysterious.</p><p>The Phantom of the Library is a fictitious existence. A character from the school paper’s serialized short story.</p><p>On the same newspaper, there’s a corner that asks the students to submit their worries to the Phantom of the Library…</p><p>If it sees to the Phantom of the Library’s taste, they’ll solve the problem written in the letter… but that doesn’t mean that’ll always happen.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Realistically speaking, there are problems that are impossible to solve. Ones asking to kill annoying parents and teachers, or wanting a sex change to become a man.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “The Phantom of the Library has no bizarre powers. They can’t solve problems that require some sort of superpowers, or ones that touch upon the laws… that’s what it is, right?</p><p>Still, the Phantom of the Library solves problems. Time and time again… But they’re not doing a charity.</p><p>In exchange for solving your problem, you’ll absolutely have to obey the Phantom of the Library’s order once. This is the rule.</p><p>Disobey, and you’ll be met with misfortune. First, you’ll start getting phone terrors. Next, you’ll find unfortunate happenings around you. If you still disobey despite that, you’ll be killed.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Not that there was actually anyone killed. They usually got cold feet after a point and listened to the orders.</p><p>As the number of people who would listen to our orders increase… the next problem would become easier to solve, and information easier to gather.</p><p>Finally, any difficult problem will be solvable by our hands. By moving our chess pieces accordingly, using the information we have.</p><p>This way, the number of people who would become our arms and legs will keep increasing. And we have other special human resources like Sanjou-kun and Hanaoka-kun, as well.</p><p>We can easily solve anything; problems that would’ve been impossible for a single person to solve however large their efforts.</p><p>That’s how the Phantom of the Library is born. How it comes to be recognized as a bizarre existence beyond human understanding.</p><p>Its fame keeps heightening, and words keep spreading. The Phantom of the Library becomes a legend passed on inside Kimisaki Academy. It becomes a complete story, just as Midori-kun wishes.</p><p>And her bliss is also my wish. This is a love story that she and I… that two literary girls spin.</p><p>Of course, cute, foolish Midori-kun has no idea of the backdoor dealings I just spoke.</p><p>At first, all I did was give her advice and instigate her to action… I made it so she would settle the students’ problems herself.</p><p>But for better or worse, she’s clumsy and dull.</p><p>She kept failing… I couldn’t stand to watch, so I started working in the shadows.</p><p>She doesn’t notice. While staying ignorant to everything, pure, adorable Midori-kun… tastes only the feelings of success and happiness that come from spinning a tale.</p><p>She will keep believing that she’s the Phantom of the Library; that she’s the protagonist of the very story she pens… Without doubting that for even a second, she will enjoy her life and youth.</p><p>And that happiness of hers, her smile, they’re the best rewards I could ask for.</p><p>So you, who have been investigating about the Phantom of the Library–you’re an eyesore to me.</p><p>You made Midori-kun worry. You wasted the time and thought process she could’ve spent on writing.</p><p>I can’t turn a blind eye. So, say… Tokikuni-kun, is it? This is my request to you. Can you please <em>not</em> stick your neck into our problem anymore?</p><p>That’s what I came to tell you. There was no proof you would back down just by hearing our conversation in the clubroom, so just in case… I went out of my way to see you.</p><p>Can you do that, Tokikuni-kun?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…Of course; I’ve lost interest in the Phantom of the Library. You never had to request. I won’t come close to you.</p><p>Your relationship–that thing you’re doing for her… it’s sick. Either way, I don’t feel like getting involved.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Fufu. It is merely one form of love. I don’t particularly wish for you to understand or sympathize.</p><p>Anyway, I’m glad. You’ve given me a peace of mind… If you hadn’t nodded to my request, I would have no choice but to kill you.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “…….”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Do you think I’m joking, Tokikuni-kun?</p><p>I’m serious, you see. If it means losing Midori-kun… losing the bonds I have with her… I would rather kill someone. I’ll beat you to death with this heavy Necronomicon.”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “I’d hate to have that as my cause of death. But didn’t you consider I might expose everything you just said?</p><p>Just with that… just by her knowing the truth… your entire relationship will crumble.</p><p>If that girl you like so much finds out she’s been made to dance on top of your palm all this time… I doubt she’ll be happy. Perhaps she’ll come to loathe you.”</p><p><strong>Shion:</strong> “Fufu. Come now, don’t make me laugh, Tokikuni-kun.</p><p>Let me ask this in return: how would you expose me? Who in this world would believe in the words of a <em>deranged electrowave girl like you</em>?”</p><p><strong>Sora:</strong> “……”</p><h3 id="8">/ 8</h3><p><strong>&gt; By the shoe lockers</strong></p><p><strong>Fumi</strong>: “~…♪”</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> “Oh?

Everything was going so well.</p><p>…That’s just natural. She had no idea I was working in the background.

Yet, you tried to reenact that story to reality.</p><p>You were convinced you could do it, when the only reason it went well in fiction was because the characters’ psychological state was as the author desired.</p><p>Reality isn’t quite like a novel.
