I’m sorry, I’m sorry — Azusa’s awful at tennis!</p><p>A–Are you injured?</p><p>Hwe? Ah, the tennis ball didn’t hurt, but you fell from the surprise? That’s horrible! Azusa will get the emergency kit, so let her take a look!☆</p><p>No need to hold back, please. Azusa is the one at fault, after all… Okay, please stay still. I’ll put a little disinfectant☆</p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Y4gNZqM.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Petapeta, kyukkyu~♪ Sharanra~n</em><em>☆</em></a></p><p>And this should do it~</p><p>Ehehe. Azusa often falls down too, so she always makes sure to have an emergency kit around☆</p><p>That was awfully careless of me… Does it still hurt?</p><p>Ah, pardon the late introduction. Kobato Azusa, is my name. I’m from 1-C, and I’ve been trying my best in the Tennis Club since this spring~☆</p><p>Azusa has only started playing tennis, so she’s still horrible at it… She’s only been dragging everyone down; She can’t even fetch the balls well.</p><p>It <em>is</em> fun, though. Perhaps it’s silly to expect to be good at everything so fast☆</p><p>…Huh?</p><p>Pardon, have we met somewhere before?</p><p>Ah, no… Sorry. That was a weird thing to say. Hmm…?</p><p>Oh, is that so? So you are the rumored transfer student senpai, yes?☆</p><p>Azusa heard a rumor about a boy transferring into Tsuyuri-senpai’s class. Azusa is from the Health Committee, like Tsuyuri-senpai~☆</p><p>So if you find yourself with an injury again, please feel free to see us in the Nurse Office. Azusa will take a look at you with a sparkling smile☆</p><p>Oh, you fetched the ball for me? Thank you very much! You’re so dependable, senpai.</p><p>…As I thought, you really resemble <em>someone</em>. Hmm…?</p><p>Ah, the Captain is calling for me… Azusa would love to speak with you more, senpai, but…</p><p>Azusa will go back to practice for now.</p><p>Azusa needs to practice tennis more and improve, so she won’t be a burden to the club!☆</p><p>Hwe? <em>Do your best</em>…? Are you cheering for Azusa? Thank you so much, senpai!☆</p><p>Azusa will do her best with a sparkling smile!☆”</p><hr><h2 id="intimacy-kobato-azusa-chapter-2">[Intimacy] Kobato Azusa, Chapter 2</h2><p><strong>Written by:</strong> Kino Seitarou</p><p><strong>&gt;By the Shoe Lockers</strong></p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nVLBuno.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="Intimacy Azusa" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/nVLBuno.jpg"></a></p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “I was so busy doing committee work in the Nurse Office, I didn’t realize it’s already so late… The Disciplinary Committee might scold us if they find us, Onii-chan.</p><p>As fellow committees doing work, I hope they would let this one pass…</p><p>Hmm? There’s no one by the gate—maybe they’ve gone home, already?</p><p>That’s one lucky thing, Onii-chan-senpai! This way, we don’t have to be scolded by the Disciplinary Committee Head!</p><p>Oh, sheesh. Feeling happy over something like this, that’s quite naughty of Azusa, huh?</p><p>Ehehe. Despite how she may look, Azusa was quite the delinquent back in the days, you know☆</p><p>Ah, but she didn’t hurt anyone, okay? If Azusa did anything like that and word got out, she won’t be able to go on as a Health Committee member!☆</p><p>Onii-chan, could it be you haven’t heard stories of Azusa’s past?</p><p>Aah, it’s nothing. It’s good if you haven’t. Azusa thought that you might’ve heard something from Anzu-san.</p><p>…Ah, no, no! It’s nothing you should worry about☆</p><p>But still, things were hectic today with the sport clubs girls everywhere jamming their fingers under balls and hurting their knees, huh?☆</p><p>Because the other Health Committee members weren’t around today, Azusa had her hands full taking care of everything—but it was good that you were there to help, Onii-chan!☆</p><p>You’re always helping other people somewhere out there, Onii-chan. That’s so wonderful of you. Let Azusa praise your efforts with a sparkling smile☆</p><p>Or maybe, you’d prefer to receive something as thanks?</p><p>Ah. Come to think of it, we’re near the shoe lockers right now, aren’t we? It reminds Azusa a little of the past☆</p><p>Fufufu, I think you’ll be surprised to find out!☆ About ‘The Love Letter Great Strategy’!</p><p>That’s a good look of surprise, Onii-chan☆</p><p>…Err, don’t tell me, are you turned off?</p><p>Geez, that’s not nice! You’re Azusa’s Onii-chan, after all—</p><p>You need to properly accept anything Azusa said! Or else, Azusa will sulk on you, okay?</p><p>Right, right; that’s the way! <em>What’s the Love Letter Great Strategy</em>, you ask? If you’ll show me an interest like that, it’ll make it more fun for Azusa to tell you, too!☆</p><p>Actually, there was this time when Azusa stuck around the school at night and snuck love letters to people’s shoe lockers☆</p><p>At that time, Kimisaki Academy was of course still an all-girls school, so it turned into an uproar over the culprits who put those love letters into the lockers…</p><p>But there were girls who conveniently misunderstood that their crush was the one who put the love letter; they confessed and even became couples☆</p><p>Hwe? Is it strange that they ended up couples, even though it’s an all-girls school?</p><p>It must be because love is above sex and gender… ☆</p><p>So anyway, Onii-chan… how about Azusa give you a letter of thanks to express her gratitude to you?</p><p>I’ll aim to write a letter that can put a sparkling smile on your face, Onii-chan; because you’re always worried for Azusa’s sake☆</p><p>Eh, that’s not something I should boldly report to you before giving…? Is that how it is?</p><p>If that’s the case, then maybe Azusa should really send a love letter instead as a surprise☆</p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Dvx79to.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="Intimacy Azusa" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Dvx79to.jpg"></a></p><p>Hwe…? Ah! I said love letter, but I don’t mean it’s a confession of my romantic love, okay? I mean the general philanthropic kind of love?☆</p><p>Azusa will send you as deep a love as what she showed to everyone in the Tennis Club and Health Committee…☆</p><p>But yes; perhaps, if it’s Azusa and you, Onii-chan, a different type of love could bloom… Fufufu☆”</p><hr><h2 id="intimacy-kobato-azusa-chapter-3">[Intimacy] Kobato Azusa, Chapter 3</h2><p><strong>Written by:</strong> Akira</p><p><strong>&gt; Infirmary</strong></p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/WhNFKcb.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img alt="Intimacy Azusa" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/WhNFKcb.jpg"></a></p><p><strong>Azusa:</strong> “<em>Sharanra<sub>n</sub></em> ♪</p><p>Let’s make everything neat~♪ Wipe everything sparkling clean with a sparkling smile~♪</p><p>Oh? Hello, Onii-chan!☆</p><p>……</p><p>…Awawa!? Did Azusa just call you Onii-chan again? Pardon me, let Azusa offer you her apologies with a sparkling smile☆</p><p>Let that one slide, please… You must find me over-familiar, yes? People often say that to Azusa: that she intrudes into others’ space too easily. There must be people who don’t like that, right?</p><p>Eh, you don’t find it unpleasant? Then, may Azusa call you ‘Onii-chan’?</p><p>Uwaah, I love you so much, Onii-chan…☆</p><p>Ehehe. I just sort of hugged you in my joy. You’re so waaarm, Onii-chan…☆</p><p>I’m sorry for this. It was lonely, doing committee work in the Nurse Office by myself!☆</p><p>Hwe? Ah yes, today is Sunday… But we always make sure to have someone on standby in the Nurse Office even for the weekends, just to be ready☆</p><p>Our school nurse doesn’t really stick around on weekends, after all.</p><p>But there are girls who have club activities around this time. We in the Health Committee make sure to be ready for the off-chance that one of those girls get hurt☆</p><p>Pardon? Ah, no no. It’s not a rule, you see.</p><p>So just because you often help us in the Health Committee out, Onii-chan, there’s no need for you to rearrange your schedule and get added to our shift☆</p><p>Just your desire to help makes us happy. We already troubled you so much during weekdays, after all. It doesn’t feel right to force you to help us even on weekends, you see~?</p><p>At first, it was just Maria-senpai attending(?) the place on her initiative during weekends. And seeing that, Azusa just wanted to help her too, you know?</p><p>It’s unbearable to simply watch as Maria-senpai, <em>alone</em>, go out of her way to school every weekend, after all.</p><p>Azusa has tennis practice on some weekends, so… you could say she’s filling in for the work here as a side trip~☆</p><p>First Azusa puts up a paper saying ‘If you have business in the Nurse Office, please contact this number’ on the door, then attends her tennis practice. If someone makes a call, she’ll dash all the way here to take care of the problem☆</p><p>Eh? <em>That’s admirable</em>, you say?</p><p>Maria-senpai is the admirable one for taking the initiative to do this! So please, praise her instead! Ruffle her hair for her hard work☆</p><p>Wawaa, hya!? No, not Azusa, but Maria-senpai! Please pat her head instead! Hauu, now Azusa’s hair is all messed up…</p><p>It’s fine, though, since Azusa is in the middle of cleaning; she can’t worry about how her hair looks. But Azusa wishes she could stay the prettiest version of herself in front of you, Onii-chan.</p><p>Ah, yes. There was no injured person to take care of today, and the tennis club’s practice is over. So Azusa is cleaning the office.</p><p>Yesterday… Saturday was Kurumi-chan’s turn to be on stand-by… She’s a little clumsy, that girl. She kind of broke stuffs all over and left the place dirty~☆</p><p>She’s always that way. So if the day before was Kurumi-chan’s shift, Azusa makes sure to clean up the place like this. Azusa loves to clean and turn the place all sparkling~☆</p><p>Uwaah, you’ll help me, Onii-chan? Thank you so much☆</p><p>Err, but, weren’t you here because you had something to do, Onii-chan? Did you hurt yourself somewhere? This is a bit too late to ask though, perhaps…</p><p>Azusa will take a look! Please sit over there—let’s play doctor☆</p><p>Ehehe. Take off your clothes, please; Azusa will diagnose you with a stethoscope☆</p><p>Hya!? I-It was a joke! Why are you so ready to take off your clothes, Onii-chan!? Please have more shame! Azusa doesn’t know where to look!☆</p><p><em>(heart thumping)</em> …Umm, so it doesn’t seem like you’re injured anywhere.</p><p>Uh-huh, so you felt a little dizzy, and thought it better to take a rest in the Nurse Office just in case?</p><p>It must be from exhaustion. I think. You’re always busily running all over, Onii-chan.</p><p>Uh-huh… So you were helping out with Basketball Club’s preparation today, since they had a practice match?</p><p>Oh, Onii-chan. You work too much. Let Azusa spoil you for the good boy you’ve been~☆</p><p>Mm-hmm, you skipped breakfast today because you woke up too early? And your lunch got eaten by Komatsu-senpai from the Basketball Club?</p><p>You have to take your meals properly, or you’ll find yourself passing out from anemia. Since you worked so hard today on an empty stomach, it’s no wonder you felt dizzy from exhaustion.</p><p>Sheesh, Onii-chan… You always put others before yourself… exactly like Anzu-senpai. Do you know that doesn’t make anyone happy? Please take care of yourself better.</p><p>…I’m sorry, that must’ve been uncalled for. Azusa made a lunch box for herself today, so please eat that instead. Azusa will buy a bread to eat from the school canteen.</p><p>They should still be open, even if it’s weekend… Geez, no need to hold back! Open your mouth, aaan~</p><p>Ehehe, does it taste good?</p><p>That’s great… Azusa is actually quite clumsy, so she’s awful at cooking. But since Kurumi-chan always cooks with such a happy look on her, Azusa’s studying from her right now~☆</p><p>Aah… umm, it’s okay. Kurumi-chan is actually really knowledgeable about cooking, see. We properly made edible food, okay?</p><p>Fufu. So you ate everything clean. I’m pleased to see you enjoyed it~☆</p><p>Then Azusa will go prepare the bed. Please lie down and get a little shut-eye, okay? I’ll get everything ready in a minute~☆</p><p>Nhi? No, no. That thing about sleeping after eating makes you fat—that’s actually just a hoax… It’s good for digestion. What you just ate will surely turn into nutrition for the body faster~☆</p><p>Now have a rest, and return to your usual energetic self, Onii-chan☆</p><p>Here, it’s ready. I’ve prepared the bed, so you can sleep here.☆</p><p>Eh? No, I won’t sleep together with you, Onii-chan… You can be uncharacteristically spoiled sometimes, can you…?</p><p>But Azusa will stay by your side until you’re deep into slumber… So please relax, and take all the rest you want, Onii-chan☆</p><p>Good boy, good boy…</p><p>Ehehe. Azusa was lonely by herself, as well, so it was fortune that you came over, Onii-chan.
